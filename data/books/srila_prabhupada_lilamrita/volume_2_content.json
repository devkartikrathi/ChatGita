        "content": "CalcuttaMarch 1971\nIT WAS MIDNIGHT. Śrīla Prabhupāda sat on a pillow behind his low desk, his light the only one on in the building. All the other devotees were in bed. On the desk before him rested the dictating machine and a volume ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamwith Bengali commentary. A small framed picture of his spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, sat between two small vases of roses and asters. On the floor beyond the desk was the broad mat covered with white cotton fabric, where a few hours before, devotees and guests had sat.\nBut now he was alone. Although usually he retired at ten, rising three or four hours later to translate, tonight he had not rested, and hisBhāgavatamlay closed, his dictating machine covered.\nHe had sent two of his disciples, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Bali-mardana, to purchase land in Māyāpur. Six days had passed, however, and still they had neither returned nor sent word. He had told them not to return until they had completed the transaction, but six days was more than enough time. He was anxious, thinking constantly of his two disciples.\nA breeze arrived, carrying the fragrance ofnīmtrees through the open window. The night was becoming cool, and Prabhupāda wore a lightcādaraaround his shoulders. Absorbed in thought, leaning against the white bolster pillow, he paid little attention to the familiar sights in his room. A clay jug with drinking water sat beside him, and a pottedtulasīplant sat upon a small wooden pedestal. The electricity, off most of the day and night, was now on, and moths and other insects hovered around the bare bulb overhead. A lizard patrolled the ceiling, occasionally darting forward near the light to capture an insect.\nWhy were Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Bali-mardana taking so long? It had been more than just a wait of six days; he had been trying to obtain land in Māyāpur for years. And this time the prospects had been excellent. He had clearly instructed Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Bali-mardana, and by now they should have returned. The delay could mean a complication, or even danger.\nThe land they were trying for was a nine-bīghaplot on Bhaktisiddhānta Road, less than a mile from the birthsite of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Sek brothers, Muslim farmers who owned the plot, had been asking a high price. Only recently had a Calcutta lawyer familiar with Navadvīpa been able to seriously negotiate a fair price. The Sek brothers had settled for 14,500 rupees, and Prabhupāda had authorized withdrawal of the funds from his bank in Krishnanagar. Thus Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Bali-mardana had left for Māyāpur, while Prabhupāda had remained in Calcutta, carrying on with his affairs but thinking often of the activities of his disciples in Māyāpur. Their mission was very important to him, and he kept them in his mind, personally blessing them with his concern.\nPrabhupāda wanted an ISKCON center in Māyāpur; it was a desire that had increased within him as his movement had increased throughout the years. He could easily visit or live in Māyāpur; that was no problem. But he needed a place for his disciples. His spiritual master had ordered him to preach in the West; and now with the success of his Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, the Western Vaiṣṇavas required a center in Māyāpur where they could reside and worship and receive the immense benefit of the holydhāma.Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had stressed the great importance of Māyāpur, and some of hissannyāsīdisciples had temples there. Why shouldn’t the International Society for Krishna Consciousness also be able to take shelter of Māyāpur?\nSince birth, Prabhupāda had been aware of the significance of Lord Caitanya and Hisdhāma,Śrī Māyāpur. He had grown up in Calcutta, where everyone knew of Lord Caitanya, and because his father, Gour Mohan De, had been a pure devotee of Lord Caitanya, from childhood he had sung the Bengali songs of Gaura-Nitāi and Their pastimes in the land of Gauḍa. He had imbibed deeply the teachings and pastimes of Lord Caitanya, especially after meeting his spiritual master in Calcutta in 1922.\nLord Caitanya had spent His first twenty-four years in Māyāpur and Navadvīpa. Yet since His manifest pastimes there almost five hundred years ago, the places of those pastimes had been obscured, the Lord’s birthsite lost, and His teachings confused and misused. Despite the disciplic line of pure devotees from Lord Caitanya, not until the advent of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, the father of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, did Lord Caitanya’ssaṅkīrtanamovement and pure teachings begin to emerge. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura published many books and preached to reestablish the intellectual, moral, and spiritual integrity of Caitanya Vaiṣṇavism. He researched and explored the land of Navadvīpa, ascertaining the exact birthsite of the Lord. Citing Vedic evidence, he established that many previous incarnations of Viṣṇu had enacted pastimes in Navadvīpa.\nNot only did Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura document Navadvīpa’s past glory, but he also foresaw its glorious future, when a religion based on the teachings of Lord Caitanya would emerge and spread throughout the world, and when European and American Vaiṣṇavas would throng to Navadvīpa to join their Bengali brothers in chanting “JayaŚacīnandana!”*The time would come, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura wrote, when in the land of Navadvīpa on the plain of the Ganges a magnificent temple would arise, proclaiming to the world the glories of Lord Caitanya.\nBhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, carrying out the desires of his father and preceptor, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, had formed the Gaudiya Math for propagating the teachings of Lord Caitanya and the glories of Navadvīpa-dhāma. He had induced a wealthy disciple to spend his fortune for erecting a temple at Lord Caitanya’s birthsite in Māyāpur, and he had constructed akīrtanahall commemorating the place of Lord Caitanya’skīrtanas.He had also constructed his own residence in Māyāpur. He had built temples throughout India – sixty-four in all – but because he wanted the English-speaking world especially to take to Lord Caitanya’s movement, he had emphasized as first priority the publishing and distributing of Kṛṣṇa conscious literature.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda, sitting in his room in the Calcutta temple, shared the great vision of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī and Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Yet to enact this great vision he had to take practical steps, and he was content to take them in the most humble way. A devotee should not simply daydream, expecting Kṛṣṇa to accomplish everything with “miracles.”\nPrabhupāda, however, was not dreaming idly. Working for years alone in India, he had held his plan of going to the West, and Kṛṣṇa had at last fulfilled that desire. In America, in whatever circumstances and with whatever small facility Kṛṣṇa had provided, he had preached. And slowly, step by step, he had met with success, realizing his vision of a worldwide society of devotees. Always he had kept his greater vision in mind, as every step forward had given him deeper satisfaction and had brought him closer to fulfilling his mission.\nPrabhupāda sometimes told the story of a poor potter who dreamed of expanding his business and becoming fabulously rich. As the potter slept one night, he dreamed of how much land and how many houses he would have and of how he would have a beautiful wife. When the potter considered that perhaps the wife would quarrel with him, he became angry and said, “If my wife fights with me, I willkickher!” And kicking, he broke the only two pots in his stock and was reduced to nothing.\nWhether chanting or writing, or reading, or preaching, Prabhupāda had been absorbed in his plans for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness and fulfilling the dream of the pastācāryas.Now he was anxious to complete the next step, and for this he was waiting up past midnight, meditating on his two disciples and their important mission.\nAs Prabhupāda sat, rapt in thought, the only sounds were the usual sounds of the night: mice within the walls, abrahmacārīsnoring on the veranda, and in the distance the night watchman making his rounds, his stick striking the street. There were no cars, and only an occasional wooden ricksha clattered along the potholed street.\nPrabhupāda wondered if perhaps his boys had been robbed. Before sending them off, he had shown Tamāla Kṛṣṇa how to carry money around his waist in a makeshift cloth money belt. But it had been a great deal of money, and robberies were not uncommon around Navadvīpa. Or perhaps there had been some other delay. Sometimes in land negotiations involving large sums of money, the court would require that a clerk record the denomination and serial number of every note exchanged. Or perhaps the train had broken down.\nSuddenly Prabhupāda heard footsteps on the stairs. Someone opened the outer door and now walked along the veranda just outside. A soft knock.\n“Yes, who is it?” Prabhupāda asked. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa entered and prostrated himself before Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“So,” Prabhupāda asked, “what is your news?”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa looked up triumphantly. “The land is yours!”\nPrabhupāda leaned back with a sigh. “All right,” he said. “Now you can take rest.”\nLondonAugust 1971Prabhupāda had asked the Indian high commissioner for the United Kingdom to petition Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to attend ISKCON’s upcoming cornerstone-laying ceremony in Māyāpur. Already Prabhupāda had instructed all his G.B.C. secretaries to attend the ceremony, and he had asked the devotees to invite many prominent citizens of Calcutta. Writing to his disciples in India, he said that if they could not get Indira Gandhi to come, they should at least get the governor of Bengal, Sri S. S. Dhavan.\nMeanwhile, Prabhupāda was meeting in London with several of his disciples experienced in architecture and design; he wanted them to draft plans for his Māyāpur project. Nara-Nārāyaṇa had built Ratha-yātrā carts and designed temple interiors, Ranchor had studied architecture, and Bhavānanda had been a professional designer, but Prabhupāda himself conceived the plans for the Māyāpur buildings. He then told his three-man committee to provide sketches and an architect’s model; he would immediately begin raising funds and securing support in India for the project. To the devotees who heard Prabhupāda’s plans, this seemed the most ambitious ISKCON project ever.\nWhile taking his morning walks in Russell Square, Prabhupāda would point to various buildings and ask how high they were. Finally he announced one morning that the main temple in Māyāpur should be more than three hundred feet high! Māyāpur’s monsoon floods and sandy soil would create unique difficulties, he said, and the building would have to be built on a special foundation, a sort of floating raft. A civil engineer later confirmed this.\nThe first building, Prabhupāda said, should be a large guesthouse, four stories high, and his design, although not strictly conforming to any one school of architecture, resembled most that of Rajasthan. He wanted a pink-and-rust colored building with many arches and a wide marble veranda on each floor except the ground floor. The building should run east-west, so that the sun would pass lengthwise over it and not shine directly into the building’s broad front. Southerly breezes would cool the guesthouse in summer. The building should be equipped with electric fans and lights, modern toilets and showers, and the rooms should be furnished, spacious, and well ventilated.\nThis guesthouse should be built as soon as possible, Prabhupāda said; then other buildings would follow. He wanted residential buildings for five hundred devotees, a largeprasādamhall seating several thousand, a kitchen complex, and agośālā(a shelter for the cows that would pasture in nearby fields). In time ISKCON would acquire adjoining land and develop parks, with flower gardens, trees and shrubs, fountains, walkways, and arbors.\nThe main building, the colossal Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir, was to be no less than three hundred feet high and costing perhaps tens of millions of dollars. Prabhupāda’s description astounded the architects as well as the devotees; it sounded grander than the United States Capitol or St. Peter’s Cathedral. The temple’s central dome would house a three-dimensional model of the universe. The design, however, would be based on the Vedic description and would depict not only the material universe but also the spiritual universe.\nEntering the main hall, a person would look up and see the planets situated just asŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamdescribes, beginning with the hellish planets, then the middle planets, wherein the earth is situated, then the heavenly planets of the demigods, and then Brahmaloka, the highest planet in the material world. Above Brahmaloka, the observer would see the abode of Lord Śiva, and above that the spiritual sky, orbrahmajyoti.Within the spiritual effulgence of thebrahmajyotiwould be the self-illuminating Vaikuṇṭha planets, inhabited by eternally liberated souls. And highest of all would be the supreme planet of Kṛṣṇaloka, where God in His original eternal form enjoys His pastimes with His most confidential devotees.\nThe temple would also house a miniature palace in which the Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa would reside, surrounded by silks and pillars of silver, gold, and jewels. The Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir and the Māyāpur city would be ISKCON’s world headquarters.\nAnd why such a fabulous architectural wonder as this in such an obscure part of the world? The answer, Prabhupāda explained, was that Māyāpur was actually not obscure; it seemed so only from the mundane perspective. To mundane vision, that which was centralseemedremote. The soul and the next life seemed remote, while the body and immediate sense gratification seemed central. By establishing the Temple of Human Understanding in Māyāpur, Śrīla Prabhupāda would be directing the materialistic world’s attention back to the true center.\nAny sincere visitor would be charmed by the beauty of ISKCON’s Māyāpur project and would perceive that here indeed was the spiritual world. And the devotees living in Māyāpur, by remaining constantly immersed in singing Hare Kṛṣṇakīrtanaand discussing the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, would be able to convince any intelligent visitor that the teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu were the highest truth. The devotees would explain the philosophy of the Absolute Truth, which would enable visitors to comprehend actual spiritual truth beyond sectarian religious dogma. Furthermore, the continuous Hare Kṛṣṇakīrtanaand the blissful devotees engaged in a wide variety of services to Lord Kṛṣṇa would demonstrate thatbhakti-yogawas the simplest, most direct process for meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While staying in ISKCON’s Māyāpur city, a person would quickly become a devotee of the Lord and begin chanting and dancing in ecstasy.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was demonstrating how the world could be spiritualized by linking material things with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, throughbhakti-yoga.And why shouldn’t such spiritual feats surpass the achievements of the materialists?\nNew DelhiNovember 10, 1971The car pulled out from the crowd in front of the airport terminal. Prabhupāda, sitting in the back seat, his bamboo cane against his knee, his hand in his bead bag, talked with his Delhi disciples. As the car moved through the broad avenues of New Delhi, Prabhupāda removed two knee-length flower garlands from around his neck and placed them beside him on the seat. It was midday, and the November climate was pleasant. Prabhupāda had arrived from Calcutta just in time for the ten-day ISKCONpaṇḍālfestival, beginning the next day.\nOne of the devotees mentioned how fitting it had been that the mayor of New Delhi, Mr. Hans Raj Gupta, had greeted Prabhupāda at the airport. Prabhupāda smiled.\nIn his speech before Mayor Gupta and a gathering at the airport, Prabhupāda had explained India’s duty of performing welfare work for the rest of the world. He had also described how, at age twenty-five, he had met his Guru Mahārāja and had then received the order to carry Lord Caitanya’s message to the English-speaking world. Explaining why he had waited until he was seventy before going West, he had remarked, “I was trying to become a successful tool for preaching Lord Caitanya’s message.” Hundreds of thousands of preachers were needed now, as the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was spreading throughout the world. “And the black men are also dancing,” Prabhupāda had said. “And they are asking the Indian people, ‘Why you and the swamis do not give us this sublime method?’ ”\nDelhi was the third Indian city Prabhupāda had visited since his return from Africa a month ago. His first stop, Bombay, had begun roughly. Śyāmasundara had neglected to carry Śrīla Prabhupāda’s inoculation card, so immigration officials had denied Prabhupāda entry into India, quarantining him at the Bombay airport hospital for ten days.\nConfined to a suite with an adjoining veranda overlooking a garden, Prabhupāda had resigned himself to a more limited sphere of activity. Still, each morning after breakfast he had conducted a dialogue with Śyāmasundara about certain leading Western philosophers: Śyāmasundara would present a particular philosophy, and Prabhupāda would discuss it in light of the Vedic view. Then, with only one day left before the end of the ten-day quarantine period, the inoculation card had arrived, and Prabhupāda had been released.\nImmediately he had left for Calcutta and a series ofkīrtanaand lecture programs at Desh Priya Park. He had stayed in Calcutta two and a half weeks, appreciating the location of the ISKCON temple at Albert Road in the heart of what had once been thesāhab(European) section. “Now I am bringing thesāhabsback to thesāhabquarter,” Prabhupāda had said, “but this time they are all coming as Vaiṣṇavas. You should never give up this place.”\nSome of the Calcutta devotees had complained to Śrīla Prabhupāda that the temple was being mismanaged and that, due to insufficient income, their diet was inadequate. When Prabhupāda had questioned the temple leaders, one devotee had replied, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was simply trying to execute your will.”\n“Is it my will,” Prabhupāda had asked, “that all the devotees should be disturbed?”\nHe had settled the differences, arranged for an improved diet, and had even recommended a democratic election of temple officers. But he had also explained that because Kṛṣṇa consciousness was such an important mission, the devotees should cooperate, even if there were discrepancies. The material world is like an ocean, he had said, and there would always be waves.\nDuring this visit to Calcutta, Prabhupāda had also spoken of his plans for Māyāpur. Nara-Nārāyaṇa had built a scale model of the building ISKCON would construct on the newly acquired property, and Prabhupāda had shown it to all his guests and had asked them to help. Seeing Prabhupāda’s absorption in this project, Girirāja had volunteered to help in any way required. “It seems the two things you want most,” Girirāja had said, “are for the books to be distributed and to build a temple at Māyāpur.”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda had said, smiling. “Yes, thank you.”\n“I understand,” said the reporter, “that by ‘Kṛṣṇa’ you mean some eternal principle.”\n“I do not mean a principle,” Prabhupāda replied. “I mean a person like you and me.” Prabhupāda was explaining Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Person when suddenly sirens began sounding.\n“Blackout! Blackout!” cried the reporter and others in the house. War between Pakistan and India had been imminent for weeks, and air raid drills and warnings were now commonplace in Delhi.\n“Sir” – the reporter spoke tensely in the darkened room – “this is the presence of reality. We are being threatened by this fight with Pakistan. The siren is the ugly reality coming for us.”\n“We are always in the ugly reality,” Prabhupāda said, “ – twenty-four hours a day. Suppose there is no blackout? Still, if you go in the street, there is no guarantee that you will get home. In this way, you are always in the ugly reality. Why do you say only this blackout? This is just one of the features of this ugly reality. That’s all.”\nReporter: “Yes, but at the moment …”\nPrabhupāda: “You do not realize that you are in ugly reality twenty-four hours a day?Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām.There is danger at every step.”\nReporter: “I know, sir, but this is collective, national danger. Have you anything to offer us as a remedy?”\nPrabhupāda: “Kṛṣṇa consciousness is our only remedy. Take to this process, and you will be happy.”\nReporter: “Sir, I think someone should go to the Yahya Khan [the president of Pakistan].”\nPrabhupāda: “What benefit will you derive by going to Yahya Khan?”\nReporter: “Someone is out to kill me.”\nPrabhupāda: “But suppose Yahya Khan does not kill you? Will you be safe? Then what is the use to go to Yahya Khan? You will die today or tomorrow. If you want to save yourself, then go to Kṛṣṇa. That is our proposition. Even if you go to Yahya Khan, and he does not fight, then you mean to say that you will live forever? What is the use of flattering Yahya Khan? Flatter Kṛṣṇa, so that you may be saved perpetually. Why don’t you do that?”\nReporter: “I was only thinking in terms of collective security. I can see your point.”\nPrabhupāda: “You should know that you are always in danger.”\nReporter: “Yes, sir, we agree. The late Einstein said the same thing.”\nPrabhupāda: “That is our position, and Kṛṣṇa says, ‘I will save you.’ Therefore, let us go to Kṛṣṇa. Why go to Yahya Khan?”\nReporter: “Simply because he is disturbing us, that’s all.”\nPrabhupāda: “Your mind is always disturbing you all the time, because it is always with you. Your body is always with you. Are you not suffering from bodily pains? Why don’t you go to Yahya Khan to cure your pains? You are always in danger. Why don’t you realize that?”\nReporter: “We realize that this is a national disaster.”\nPrabhupāda: “These are symptoms. People are trying to give a patchwork cure for the disease.Weare giving the supreme cure. This is the difference. No patchwork cure will help you. You need a complete cure.\nThe cure is no more repetition of birth and death. That is what we want. That is the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.Yaṁ prāpya na nivartante / tad dhāma paramaṁ mama.If you go to Kṛṣṇa, then you don’t come back again to this material world.”\nReporter: “Sir, mine was a very hypothetical question. Suppose a hundred pure, saintly, Kṛṣṇa conscious people are meditating or discussing together, and someone comes along and drops the bomb – ”\nPrabhupāda: “Those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious are not afraid of bomb. When they see a bomb coming, they think that Kṛṣṇa desired the bomb to come. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is never afraid of anything.Bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syāt.One who has the conception that something can exist outside of Kṛṣṇa is afraid. On the other hand, one who knows that everything is coming from Kṛṣṇa has no reason to be afraid. The bomb is coming – he says, ‘Ah, Kṛṣṇa is coming.’ That is the vision of the devotee. He thinks, ‘Kṛṣṇa wants to kill me with a bomb. That is all right. I will be killed.’ That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nWhen the reporter asked if the Vaiṣṇava would die without fighting, Prabhupāda said that the Vaiṣṇava would fight, but only under the direction of Kṛṣṇa, and he cited Arjuna and Hanumān as examples. He continued to explain Kṛṣṇa consciousness as the only solution. The blackout ended.\nThe devotees found everyone they met sympathetic to Śrīla Prabhupāda. They respected him, especially after meeting him. Some disagreed philosophically, yet all were impressed by Prabhupāda’s converting Westerners to Hindudharmaand God consciousness, and they had genuine respect for Prabhupāda’s worldwide propagation of the teachings ofBhagavad-gītā.\nPrabhupāda had great stature among the Indians as asādhu.Speaking only on the basis of the scriptures, he exhibited full surrender to Lord Kṛṣṇa. He was above politics and sectarianism; he was fully spiritual and commanded respect. Everyone, regardless of personal philosophies or practices, seemed to accept him as a true representative of Indian culture, a genuinesādhuandguru.\nAmong the distinguished persons who agreed to appear as guest speakers during the ten-day festival were Sri Hans Raj Gupta, mayor; H. Bachchan, a famous Hindi poet; Sri Syama Caran Gupta, chairman of the Delhi Metropolitan Council; Sri C. B. Agarwal, a famous orator; Sri Vipin Candra Misra, magistrate of the Delhi High Court; Dr. Atma Ram, a renowned scientist; Colonel B. R. Mohan, ex-mayor and industrialist of Lucknow; Sri L. N. Sakalani, a prominent industrialist; Sri Aditya Nath Jha, the lieutenant-governor of Delhi; Sri Jagjivan Ram, Indian defense minister; and His Excellency James George, the Canadian high commissioner. Gurudāsa had also had friendly conversations with the U.S. ambassador to India, Kenneth Keating, who had repeatedly expressed his respect for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Ambassador Keating regretted that he would be out of town during the function.\nThe devotees had secured an excellent location at the L.I.C. Grounds in Connaught Place, the heart of New Delhi’s commercial district. There they had arranged for a large tent and outdoor lighting for the ten-day festival. On opening day the program started at six A.M. with akīrtanaand anāratibefore the newly arrived Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, white marble Deities from Jaipur enthroned upon a flower-bedecked altar on the large stage. Attendance was sparse at first, but picked up when after a noonkīrtanaandāratidevotees began distributingkṛṣṇa-prasādam.The evening program started with akīrtana,which continued enthusiastically, building to an ecstatic climax as Śrīla Prabhupāda entered.\nFor the pious people of Delhi, the evening Hare Kṛṣṇa festival was a momentous occasion. Since the location and the hour were ideal and admission was free, the crowd had grown to tens of thousands, many having come specifically to see the young American Vaiṣṇavas.\nAt Prabhupāda’s arrival hundreds of people surged forward to touch his feet and receive his blessings, as a ring of disciples escorted him through the crowd. Prabhupāda, wearing a gray woolcādara,his “swami hat” pushed back casually on his head, moved calmly forward toward the stage with natural, aristocratic poise. He sat on thevyāsāsana,and the audience quieted.\nNew Delhi’s mayor, Sri Hans Raj Gupta, spoke first. He had met Śrīla Prabhupāda in the early 1960s when Prabhupāda had approached him for a donation to publish the first volume ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Mayor Gupta, recognizing Prabhupāda as “someone sincere and near to God,” had helped, and Prabhupāda had later presented him with complimentary copies of the first two volumes of hisŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Mr. Gupta was impressed by Prabhupāda’s success in spreading Vaiṣṇavism in the West, and as he introduced Śrīla Prabhupāda, he expounded on the Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy he had read in Prabhupāda’sBhāgavatams.\nHe said, speaking in Hindi, that as mayor of Delhi for five years he had many times welcomed important visitors and delivered addresses, but such functions were usually only formalities. This was not, however, the case with Śrīla Prabhupāda, he said, since no one he had ever known could compare with him. He praised Prabhupāda for doing “an immense amount of good work in India and the whole world.” Said Mayor Gupta, “He has also given me love and affection, and I am more affected by that than anything else.”\nThen Prabhupāda spoke. When he began by asking whether the audience preferred him to speak in Hindi or English, many called out for Hindi, a few for English. But Prabhupāda announced, “I am going to speak in English, because my disciples, being Americans and Europeans, have joined me. They are following me, and they must understand. If I speak in Hindi they cannot follow. So I am going to speak in English.”\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” Prabhupāda continued, “I thank you for your kindly participating in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Just now we will vibrate one transcendental song,Jaya Rādhā-Mādhava Kuñjabihārī.As you know, Kṛṣṇa’s eternal consort is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, the pleasure potency of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When He wants to enjoy, He exhibits His pleasure potency, which is known as Rādhārāṇī.”\nAfter chantingJaya Rādhā-MādhavaPrabhupāda expounded the science of Kṛṣṇa for half an hour, quotingBhagavad-gītāon why Kṛṣṇa comes to the material world, how thejīvasouls are transmigrating from one body to another, birth after birth, and how human life is the opportunity for thejīvasouls to revive their love of Kṛṣṇa.\n“This is religion,” Prabhupāda said, “ – simply surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Become a Kṛṣṇaite. … It doesn’t require a church. It doesn’t require a mosque. It doesn’t require anything. But wherever you sit down, you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is the easiest method.”\nFollowing Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the ancient speaker ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,Prabhupāda condemned a materialistic life spent “working hard like the hogs or dogs,” without self-realization. He emphasized that India had a treasure house of knowledge, which Indians should distribute all over the world. Unfortunately, the Indians were forgetting their real duty.\nIn conclusion Prabhupāda said, “So there are many things to be spoken in this connection of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. I am trying to present this to you in the next ten days. This is the beginning. I shall request you to come here. We don’t charge any fees. We are depending on Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa likes, He will benefit us. We are completely surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. If He likes, He can maintain us. If He likes, He can kill us. We don’t mind. We have no business. We have no separate interest. We request you to come and join this movement. It is not sectarian. We have many Hindus, Christians, Jews, Muhammadans, and Sikhs also all over the world who are now in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are preaching one word,Kṛṣṇa,one scripture,Bhagavad-gītā,and onemantra,Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Thank you very much.”\nPrabhupāda attempted to leave the stage, and again the crowd rushed forward to touch his lotus feet. Although Prabhupāda’s disciples were already convinced of his greatness, that greatness took on a vivid reality at times like this, when they heard him speaking so powerfully and saw him surrounded by throngs of worshipers.\nAs Prabhupāda proceeded to his car, he remained calm and humble, but the disciples surrounding him tensed to protect him from being jostled by a frantic crowd. Yet despite the devotees’ sincere attempts, individuals in the crowd would manage to break through, diving between the devotees’ legs to throw themselves before Prabhupāda.\n“Do you know why they are worshiping me?” Prabhupāda said, turning to the disciples near him. “It is because I am free from sex desire.”\nFor ten consecutive nights Śrīla Prabhupāda lectured at thepaṇḍāl.In many of his lectures he would speak ofdharma(religion) in connection with the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\n“The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the topmostyogasystem. It is very scientific. Don’t think it is a sentimental movement. It is authorized, supported by the Vedic literatures. And actually it is becoming effective. Religion is surrender to God. These boys and girls have taken to this real religion. This movement is so important, and we are giving everyone a chance to make this life successful. Therefore our humble request is that you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nOn the fifth evening, after Justice Misra had referred to religion in his introduction, Śrīla Prabhupāda defined the word in his lecture. “Religionmeans constitutional position. In the English dictionaryreligionis described as faith. But by Vedic definition religion cannot be changed like faith because it is the law given by the Lord. Only surrender unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa isdharma.That is Kṛṣṇa’s verdict. One should not have any ulterior motive in approaching God.\n“Why not surrender immediately? Be intelligent. Real religion means to surrender immediately. Why should you wait for many, many births? We request all of you to try to understand this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously. Take to it, and you will become happy.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda saw the Indian people abandoning theirdharmafor materialism, and he spoke strongly, pointing out their great mistake and urging them to rectify it. “If you actually want to advance your nation, India, then you must take to the culture of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This will glorify your country. You cannot compete with the Western world in the field of technology. It is impossible. The Western countries are meant for that purpose, for advancing technology. But you are meant for a different purpose. Your special advantage is that you have been born in this land of Bhārata-varṣa after many, many births and after performing many pious activities.\n“India is very poverty-stricken, so wherever I go I am told I come from a very poor country. India advertises this image – our ministers beg from other countries. We are accepted as a beggars’ culture. At the Berkeley University one Indian student protested the studying of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. He was the only student to protest. He said, ‘Swamiji, what benefit is made by accepting this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement?’ In another place a girl asked me, ‘Swamiji, what is God?’ So I asked her, ‘Are you Indian? You should be ashamed of being called an Indian, because you ask what is God, although you come from India, the land of God.’ India is the land where Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared. So although you may be born Indian, if you have nodharma,what is the difference between you and the animals?”\nOne night while Prabhupāda was speaking, an American hippie in the audience approached the stage. He had long, wild blond hair and wore a vest and high leather boots. A miniature framed picture of Viṣṇu, Brahmā, and Śiva hung on a chain around his neck. When the boy tried to climb up on the stage, some of the devotees pushed him back, but Śrīla Prabhupāda intervened. He had a devotee bring a cushion and place a microphone in front of the boy. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “Yes?”\n“Have you realized yourself?” the young man demanded. “Have you realized the soul in the innermost depths of your being?”\n“Yes!” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied.\nAt first the man was taken aback, but then he again challenged, “Now you tell me another thing. When was theBhagavad-gītāwritten?”\n“Now you answermyquestion,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. “What is the process of receiving knowledge from theBhagavad-gītā?”\n“No,” the young man retorted, “you tellme– when was theBhagavad-gītāwritten? In your lecture you said five thousand years ago, but according to other swamis, it was written only fifteen hundred years ago. Answer my question. I asked you first!”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda raised his voice angrily. “I am notyourservant, I am Kṛṣṇa’s servant. You must answer my question!”\nA heated argument began, with the hippie yelling at Śrīla Prabhupāda and Śrīla Prabhupāda arguing back. Finally, the devotees removed the boy from the stage.\nThe incident confused the audience. Many people began to leave. “Why did your Guru Mahārāja become angry?” some of them demanded from the devotees. “He should have answered the man’s question.” Some of the civic leaders supporting thepaṇḍālprogram also became upset, fearing Śrīla Prabhupāda had made an unfavorable impression on the public. Those who were devotional, however, remained in their seats to hear further what Prabhupāda had to say.\nTo the devotees it was inconceivable. Why had Prabhupāda, in the middle of his talk, invited a crazy hippie onto the stage, given him a microphone and a seat, and then argued with him to the point of yelling and shouting? And all before an audience of twenty thousand!\nBhavānanda:One man who had helped organize thepaṇḍālprotested,“Oh, Swamiji has gotten angry. This is not good.” But Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed to have done it purposefully. He had spoken for a long time that evening on how to understand theBhagavad-gītā,and then he had this hippie brought on the stage. It was bewildering to us. We couldn’t figure it out.\nGirirāja:Śrīla Prabhupāda was actually using the entire incident to illustrate the process of understandingBhagavad-gītā.After the man left, Prabhupāda completed his lecture by stating that one must approach Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa’s representative with a submissive attitude, by serving and inquiring, not simply asking challenging questions. The whole incident had illustrated this point.\nYadubara:Many in the audience misunderstood the incident. It caused a split. But those who understood what Śrīla Prabhupāda had done could see that this hippie was a rascal, and this had been a time for transcendental anger against his nonsensical opinions.\nTejās:After everything was over, Prabhupāda told us, “Just as thegopīswere lusty for Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna would also get angry for Kṛṣṇa. So it is not bad that a devotee becomes angry for Kṛṣṇa.” But many people in the crowd could not understand this point – how a devotee is not impersonal. The Indians are used to seeing impersonalistyogīswho express no emotion. The audience was mostly impersonalists.\nThe last night of thepaṇḍālprogram, Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke privately with James George, the Canadian high commissioner.\nMr. George: “You have attracted so many Canadians and Americans.”\nPrabhupāda: “I have not attracted them. Kṛṣṇa has attracted them.”\nMr. George: “True.”\nPrabhupāda: “Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive. I am simply presenting the means of being attracted. That is my business. It is similar to the way a magnet attracts iron. If the iron is rusty, however, then magnetic force cannot attract. Therefore, my business is to remove the dirt. This process isceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam,cleansing the heart.\n“At the present moment every one of us is in a consciousness of thinking, ‘I am this body.’ Because you were born in Canada, you are thinking you are Canadian. Because I was born in India, I am thinking I am Indian. And because he was born in America, he is thinking he is American. None of us are American, Canadian, or Indian. We are living entities.”\nMr. George: “I have no problem following all of that. How, though, is this change of consciousness to be brought about, for example, in the West? This, I take it, is your mission.”\nPrabhupāda: “There is no question of East and West. It is philosophy – it is science. In mathematics, for instance, two plus two equals four. This is equally understandable in the West as well as the East. It is not that two plus two in the West is five, and two plus two in the East is three. Two plus two is equal to four everywhere.\n“The first knowledge, then, that must be understood by human society is that we are not these bodies. It is very common knowledge. From this point, our spiritual knowledge can advance. If we do not know what spirit is, then what is the question of advancing in spiritual knowledge?”\nAfter their conversation, Mr. George accompanied Prabhupāda to the stage and introduced him to the crowd.\n“For several years I’ve been wanting to meet this swami and see what it was about him that was affecting so many of our young people in Canada and North America. I was very happy this evening to come in response to your kind invitation, and especially to meet Swamiji. I think, as he himself said to me a short time ago, there is something really happening. Whether he is doing it or it is being done through him, as he said, it is beside the point. But there is something happening, and everyone who doubts that should be here tonight to see this. It is happening, not only here in Delhi, but it’s happening in Toronto and Cleveland and Los Angeles and New York and all sorts of places. What is it? I don’t know how he would answer that question. For me, at a deeper level what is happening is the awakening of a search.”\nIn his lecture, Śrīla Prabhupāda compared the material body to a machine operated by a driver, the soul. And he spoke of the soul’s natural position as servant of Kṛṣṇa. Addressing Mr. George, Prabhupāda concluded his speech.\n“Here our honorable high commissioner of Canada is present. I request that since you have come to our country, please try to understand this philosophy. I have traveled in your country, in Canada, also, and as you have already mentioned, we have got five branches, in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Hamilton, and Ottawa. So the boys are struggling. They are distributing culture, these books, and I am getting very encouraging reports. Many young men are also coming. It is a very scientific movement. So I request you to inform your government to give these boys facility to inject this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in your country. Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nAfter the successful ten-daypaṇḍālfestival – seven hundred thousand had attended – Śrīla Prabhupāda took his disciples on a short excursion to Vṛndāvana. His preaching tours had taken him to such places as Amritsar, Surat, Indore, Gorakhpur, Allahabad, and Benares, but never to Vṛndāvana. With so many of his disciples gathered in Delhi for the festival, Prabhupāda considered it an opportune time to travel to nearby Vṛndāvana.\nThey set out in two vehicles, Śrīla Prabhupāda and four others in Mrs. Kamala Bakshi’s Ambassador and forty devotees following in a rented bus. Prabhupāda remained silent during the ride out of the city, past the factories and through the agricultural fields, groves, and villages along the Delhi–Agra Road en route to Vṛndāvana. When, after a couple of hours, they approached the outskirts of Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda directed the driver of his car to a village and into the center of the small town to a sweet-water well. Here Prabhupāda and his party drank, took a breakfast of fresh fruit, and then continued on their way. Just before reaching Chhatikara Road, which leads directly into Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda’s car broke down.\nTejās:After Prabhupāda’s car broke down, he rode the rest of the way with us on the bus. Our relationship with Prabhupāda was very reverential, although we were in the most intimate situation, staying with him and traveling in a bus with him. Prabhupāda never said anything about it. In those days we were actually very much like a family – Prabhupāda knew everyone, and everyone knew Prabhupāda and would talk to him –  but still we were very reverential.\nIn Vṛndāvana a Mr. G. L. Saraf accommodated Prabhupāda, his secretaries, and the women in the party at his home, Saraf Bhavan. The rest of the devotees stayed in a nearbydharmaśālā.\nPrabhupāda had come to Vṛndāvana for more than just a pilgrimage; he had come to try and secure land for ISKCON. When in 1967 he had come to Vṛndāvana from America, he had come to recuperate, but on recovering his health he had looked for a place in Vṛndāvana for his disciples. He had tried to establish an “American House,” a center where his disciples could live in Vṛndāvana’s ideal atmosphere and receive training in Kṛṣṇa conscious culture and then go out and preach. But after two months of little prospect for establishing his American House, he had left.\nThis time, however, Prabhupāda was coming to Vṛndāvana as that city’s famous ambassador to the world, renowned for propagating the glories of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Vṛndāvana in the West. The success of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement was being widely publicized in India, as Prabhupāda and his band of foreign disciples traveled from city to city holdingkīrtanas,lecturing fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and telling of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the West. So when Prabhupāda arrived in Vṛndāvana with forty disciples, the entire town heralded his presence.\nThe municipality of Vṛndāvana arranged a formal reception, attended by prominent local citizens andsādhus.A spokesman for the city praised Śrīla Prabhupāda and his accomplishments. “O great soul! Today we, the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, known as Brijabāsīs, all combinedly offer our humble welcome to Your Holiness in this holy place of Vṛndāvana, and in doing so we feel very proud. … For many years you stayed in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple and worshiped Her Majesty Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī in a meditative mood, and thus you now have the transcendental vision to deliver the entire world. As proof of your perfection, we can see these foreign devotees before us, and we feel very proud to see how you have transformed them into such pure devotees.\n“O great preacher of Vedic culture, formerly a great many swamis went to foreign countries, but now you have wonderfully preached thesaṅkīrtanamovement and the sublime philosophy ofbhakticult in the Western countries, and that is the only means for giving peace and prosperity to all people of the world in this age. For preaching religion and culture, your holy name will remain ever dazzling.\n“To speak frankly, we feel a very intimate relationship with you, and we feel perfect satisfaction at this time in the privilege to present you this address of welcome. We take it for granted that you are one of us in Vṛndāvana. We are sure that wherever you travel, you must carry with you the impression of Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma. The culture, religion, philosophy, and transcendental existence of Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma travel with you. Through the great message Your Holiness carries, all the people of the world are now becoming very intimately related with Vṛndāvana-dhāma. We are certainly sure that through your preaching alone the transcendental message of Vṛndāvana will spread all over the world. May you be crowned a success in these noble activities.”\nThen Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke, beginning by explaining how the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is trying to establishdaiva-varṇāśrama,or a God-conscious social order, with universal application.\n“We should not consider that Kṛṣṇa is Hindu or Indian. Kṛṣṇa is for all. These foreigners are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness by understanding that Kṛṣṇa is for all. They are not accepting a form of religious principles, like Hindu or Muslim or Christian. These are designated religions. If I am calling myself a Hindu, this is not my religion – this is my designation. Because I happen to take birth in a Hindu family, therefore I call myself a Hindu. Or because I take birth in a particular land, I call myself Indian or American. But our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not for such designated personalities. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness issarvopādhi-vinirmuktam.When one becomes free from all designations, he can take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As long as one is Hindu or Muslim or Christian, there is no question of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n“So these boys and girls, or ladies and gentlemen, who have joined me, they have given up their designations. They are no longer Americans or Canadians or Australians. They are thinking of themselves as eternal servants of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Without this, there is no question of liberation from the material contamination. As long as there is material contamination, we have to devise these social orders and spiritual orders, according tośāstra –asbrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,śūdra,brahmacārī,gṛhastha,vānaprastha,andsannyāsa.These are all material designations. But this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for becoming transcendental to these material designations, and these boys, these foreigners, they are being taught in that light.\n“When I started my propaganda in New York, 26 Second Avenue, that time only half a dozen boys were coming and hearing. That hearing means I was singing, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,and reading some verses fromBhagavad-gītā,and they were patiently hearing. Because I know if someone patiently hears the holy name of Kṛṣṇa or about His pastimes, then –śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ –Kṛṣṇa purifies him from within.\n“So, actually it so happened with these boys and girls. I say boys and girls, because in the Western countries there is no distinction. They are given equal liberty. In our country there is still discrimination. I mean to say, grown-up boys and girls are not allowed to mix together, although it is going on now. But in European countries there is no such restriction. So there was no possibility of making any distinction between the boys and the girls. So many of them are attending. I was chanting in Tompkins Square Park, and these boys and girls used to surround me and dance and chant Hare Kṛṣṇamantra.Some of them became a little advanced and purified and came forward, ‘Swamiji, please accept me as your disciple.’\n“So my condition was that anyone who wants to become my disciple must be free from the four kinds of sinful activities: illicit connection with women, meat-eating, intoxication, gambling. In this way, on this condition, these boys and girls were accepted as my disciples. According topañcarātrikī viddhi,when they are fairly advanced they are given the sacred thread,upanayana-saṁskāra,following the path and instruction of my Guru Mahārāja, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda. According tośāstra,they should not be considered as coming from families ofmlecchasandyavanas –they should not be considered like that – because they are now purified. That is also mentioned by Śukadeva Gosvāmī in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and you know of it:\nHow to become purified? By taking shelter of a bona fide spiritual master. So they are all purified according to thepañcarātrikī viddhi,and many of them have got this sacred thread.”\nPrabhupāda continued explaining the holy name’s power to elevate anyone, regardless of birth, and he cited Haridāsa Ṭhākura who, despite his Muhammadan birth, was accepted as theācāryaof chanting the holy name. Prabhupāda also discussed the dynamics of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, telling how, according to Rūpa Gosvāmī’s principle ofyukta-vairāgya,the International Society for Krishna Consciousness was using material things in the service of Kṛṣṇa.\n“In the Western countries they are very luxuriously situated. My disciples are giving me residential quarters even a governor could not imagine. I remember one night some time back I was a guest in a Lucknow government house. At that time the governor was Biswanath Das, and he was personally known to me. So I remember the kind of luxurious apartment where I had the opportunity to lie down one night. But they, my disciples, are giving me all this. So we cannot reject that, because that is the standard of living in America. You cannot say, ‘No, I shall not lie down in this nice apartment. I shall lie down in the street. I am asannyāsī.’ Then nobody will respect me. There in America the standard of living is like that. Therefore, Rūpa Gosvāmī says that you should not be attached to that, but for the service of Kṛṣṇa if you have to use such things, you should receive it.\n“People are engaged in the service ofmāyā,but we want to engage everything in the service of the Lord. That is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So we are using airplanes, we are using dictaphones, we are using teletype machine. Even for cleansing our floor, we are using a machine. This is the system. In each and every center we have got new cars. We cannot do without them. In Europe and America practically no gentleman walks in the street. It is the system there. So we have to use it, but we should not be attached to it. Our attachment should be only for Kṛṣṇa, and for Kṛṣṇa’s service we can accept anything. That is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.”\nPrabhupāda concluded his address by asking for land. He wanted to establish a temple for his society in Vṛndāvana.\nAfterward, a Mr. S., a motor parts salesman and resident of Vṛndāvana, offered Prabhupāda a plot of land his family had been saving for some worthy religious purpose. Prabhupāda smiled. Although he had only just arrived in Vṛndāvana, already Kṛṣṇa was providing an opportunity for establishing his ISKCON center. Prabhupāda thanked Mr. S. for offering this service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. By his donating land, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement would increase, and the donor, Mr. S., would benefit.\nPrabhupāda was aware that behind the formal reception and ceremonial words of Vṛndāvana’s prominent citizens dwelt a deeper feeling of reserve and even suspicion, especially among the castegosvāmīs,the proprietors of Vṛndāvana’s major temples. While accepting Śrīla Prabhupāda’s foreign disciples as devotees (of a sort), many Vṛndāvana residents nevertheless felt reluctant to accept the foreign Vaiṣṇavas asbrāhmaṇas,sannyāsīs,andpūjārīs.This misunderstanding was due to a traditional Hindu concept: only those born in castebrāhmaṇafamilies could becomebrāhmaṇas.\nPrabhupāda, however, followed exactly in the footsteps of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, who had freely accepted anyone, regardless of sex or social position. When in 1932 Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had led more than one thousand followers in a Vṛndāvana pilgrimage, certain prideful castebrāhmaṇashad denied the pilgrims entry into the temples. The pilgrims had been harassed by rock throwers and boycotted by shopkeepers. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had then met withbrāhmaṇasof Vṛndāvana and had scripturally proved to them that the soul, being transcendental, was free from designation and that anyone who became a Vaiṣṇava automatically qualified as abrāhmaṇa.The prejudices, however, had remained.\nPrabhupāda also followed Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta in denying that thegosvāmītitle could be inherited.Gosvāmīmeant one who controlled the senses, and the title could not be adopted simply because one was born in a family of so-calledgosvāmīs.\nThe originalgosvāmīswere the six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana: Śrī Sanātana, Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Śrī Jīva, Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa, and Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmīs, all of whom were in the renounced order and were, therefore, without issue. Almost five hundred years ago, these six Gosvāmīs had discovered the places of Kṛṣṇa’s Vṛndāvana pastimes and had built the first big temples in Vṛndāvana. They had appointed married disciples to carry on the Deity worship in their temples, and now the descendants of those original priests were claiming exclusive rights as templegosvāmīsin Vṛndāvana. Prabhupāda had written inThe Nectar of Devotionabout his spiritual master’s struggle in this matter:\nPrabhupāda therefore opposed the castegosvāmīs’ideas of birthright. And the castegosvāmīsfeared Prabhupāda’s movement, since it threatened their hereditary social preeminence. Yet on this occasion of Prabhupāda’s triumphant return after preaching Vṛndāvana’s glories to the Western world, no one protested his attempts to establish a temple. Those who disagreed remained silent or even offered flowery praise.\nRamaṇa-reti (literally “charming sand”) was mostly forest, with a fewāśramasand abandoned fields. Celebrated as a favorite spot of Kṛṣṇa’s, where He and His brother Balarāma and Their cowherd boyfriends had played five thousand years ago, Ramaṇa-reti abounded in transcendental love of God, which is the special atmosphere of Vṛndāvana.\nAlthough various city officials had casually mentioned that the city might donate land, Prabhupāda took more seriously Mr. S.’s offer. Mr. S. explained that although othersādhushad been asking for the land, he and his wife had not yet decided; they wanted to give it to a group who would build a Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple there as soon as possible. When Prabhupāda assured Mr. S. he would do so, Mr. S. vowed that the land was now Prabhupāda’s.\nPrabhupāda had heard such promises before, and they had often proved false. But considering this offer serious, he appointed disciples to remain in Vṛndāvana to draw up a deed with Mr. S.\nMeanwhile, Prabhupāda took his disciples on a pilgrimage to many of the important holy places of Vṛndāvana: Varṣāṇā (the birthplace of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī), Gokula (the place of Kṛṣṇa’s earliest pastimes), Rādhā-kuṇḍa, Govardhana, and Vṛndāvana’s major temples. At Govardhana Prabhupāda told the devotees not to step on Govardhana Hill or pick up any of the rocks: Govardhana Hill was nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. Also at Govardhana Prabhupāda took the devotees to a little temple, where he showed them Kṛṣṇa’s footprint. The footprint was very large. If Kṛṣṇa’s foot had been that big, the devotees marveled, then He must have been eight feet tall. “Yes,” Prabhupāda said. “They were much bigger then.”\nNear Govardhana, at Bindu-sarovara, a lake commemorating the place where Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa first met, the devotees swam while Prabhupāda bathed from buckets of water in the nearby field. Later, while Prabhupāda tookprasādam,the devotees tried to chase away a few stray dogs by throwing stones and yelling, but Prabhupāda stopped them. “Leave them alone,” he said, and he began throwing the dogsprasādamfrom his plate.\nAt Varṣāṇā, the birthplace of Rādhārāṇī, the devotees carried Prabhupāda on a palanquin up the many steep steps to the temple. On the top of the hill, he looked toward a distant hill. “Just over there,” he said, pointing, “Kṛṣṇa used to come down that hill. Rādhā would come down this hill, and They would meet in the middle. There was a forest there. So this is a very special place, because it is the meeting place of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.”\nIn each holy place Prabhupāda would sit down, hold akīrtana,and come before the Deity and offer obeisances. Then he would briefly describe the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa related with the particular place.\nDīnadayādri:The Indians at the holy places were always hounding Prabhupāda for money. They assumed that his disciples, being Americans, were rich, so they wanted money. Prabhupāda would give something, but there were so many that as soon as he would give to one, half a dozen others would crowd around him, preventing him from walking by. In some of the temples they wouldn’t let us enter.\nPrabhupāda then took his group to the place beside the Yamunā where Kṛṣṇa had shown His mother all the universes within His mouth. Touching the water, Prabhupāda said, “It is too cold for an old man like me. But you take a bath. I’ll put a few drops on my head.” He directed the women to a separate place to swim, where the Indian women bathed, and the men plunged in and began swimming. They sported in the water as Prabhupāda stood on the bank, watching. Suddenly Prabhupāda put on agamchā,walked to the river’s edge, sprinkled some water on his head, and then waded in up to his knees. The devotees were delighted to see him duck beneath the water and begin bathing and splashing with them in the Yamunā.\nAt the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple Prabhupāda told the devotees of his plans for an ISKCON temple in Vṛndāvana, and he suggested to the Rādhā-Dāmodarapūjārīthat ISKCON use the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple.\n“We shall prepare the whole temple nicely,” Prabhupāda said, “and we shall make a silver throne for the Deity. Fifty to a hundred men will takeprasādamhere. It will be unique. If you want to, we can do it. Otherwise we can start our own temple somewhere. We are prepared to spend money. If you give us a chance, we’ll spend it here. We want to make this a great festival in Vṛndāvana, because it is Jīva Gosvāmī’s place. Rūpa Gosvāmī and Jīva Gosvāmī sat here. We have literature, we have books. Everyone is associating with us all over the world.”\nYamunā-devī dāsī:His Divine Grace was very frequently giving indication of how much he wanted his rooms at Rādhā-Dāmodara maintained nicely. He was extremely fond of his quarters there. One night during his stay in Saraf Bhavan he agreed that he would stay for one twenty-four-hour period within his rooms at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. It was a very exciting event for all of us to look forward to. He selected three or four men to accompany him to spend the night there at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple.\nSaraf Bhavan was some distance from Seva-kuñja, where the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple is located. During the very early hours of the morning I walked through the streets of Vṛndāvana and arrived at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. Inside of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s sleeping room I could see the light coming through the latticed red stone windows and the wooden shutters. Back and forth he was walking and chanting.\nSuddenly, very much to my surprise, the wooden shutters burst open, and a shaft of light filled a small corner of the courtyard. Prabhupāda stood in his room under one bare light bulb. When he saw me, he asked, “How have you gotten here?” I said that I had walked. “Oh, this is not good,” he said. “It is very dangerous in the street. There are so many wild dogs. And there are dacoits. In this quarter a man will kill even for aloṭā[waterpot].”\nSo there was some chastisement from Prabhupāda on the one hand, but on the other hand he seemed pleased. “So you are chantingjapa?” he said. And I said, “Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.” He said, “That is very nice. So go to thesamādhiof Rūpa Gosvāmī and chant there.”\nThen around four o’clock other pilgrims were starting to filter in to attend the morningāratiprogram. Prabhupāda came out where we were chanting, and he said that this corner at Rādhā-Dāmodara temple was just like the hub of the wheel of the spiritual world – it was the center. He requested that his rooms always be well maintained and that they be cleansed daily.\nRādhānātha:I had only met Śrīla Prabhupāda briefly in Bombay, and then I had gone alone to live in Vṛndāvana. I had lived there about six months with the local people, and it was there that I got real attached to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I used to just live on the bank of the river with all thebābājīs –a very simple life. I know it was just by that initial contact with Prabhupāda that that seed was planted.\nOne day a big bus full of American devotees having akīrtanapulled into Vṛndāvana, and I was thinking, “Oh, here they are again.” The first thing I asked was, “Is Prabhupāda coming?” And they said, “Yes, Prabhupāda is here. He will be speaking tomorrow morning.”\nI was already attracted to a lot ofgurusin Vṛndāvana – Prabhupāda’s Godbrothers and also devotees from othersampradāyas.But on the morning when I came for theBhāgavatamclass and heard Prabhupāda chantingJaya Rādhā-Mādhava,I just sat there and listened. I had never seen anyone with such a quality of love for Kṛṣṇa. All the great people I had met in India became insignificant when I saw Prabhupāda chantingJaya Rādhā-Mādhava.He was so serious and grave, and the quality of his devotion was so intense. I just couldn’t believe it.\nHe kept looking over at me every now and then, kind of nodding, because I guess he remembered me from Bombay. Then he spoke, and he was glorifying Vṛndāvana so nicely. He was talking about how wonderful Vṛndāvana is, how spiritual the atmosphere is, and he was talking about how careful the devotees must be to take advantage of the atmosphere.\nFrom that day I started thinking, “This is my Guru Mahārāja” – just because of the way he spoke. His lecture had been so precise and inclusive that it had encompassed every other philosophy and every other teacher I had ever heard. I could see also that Prabhupāda’s example was pure, and I could see his disciples were actually giving up sinful life. I used to go to hisdarśanasevery day, although I was still living on the bank of the Yamunā.\nAll the people of Vṛndāvana were glorifying Prabhupāda. They were so proud of him, because the people of Vṛndāvana are attached to Vṛndāvana. They love Kṛṣṇa, and they love Vṛndāvana, because Vṛndāvana is the place where Kṛṣṇa lives. That’s their mood. They worship the land of Vṛndāvana. But they would tell me they appreciated Prabhupāda. Most of them would call him “Swami Bhaktivedanta.” They would say, “He’s the greatest saint, because he is bringing Vṛndāvana all over the world. He is making the glories of Vṛndāvana known to the whole world.”\nThen one day Prabhupāda and his disciples went to anāśramain Ramaṇa-reti. I got there late, just as Prabhupāda was leaving. He was walking the last twenty yards or so to his taxi, and many Brijabāsīs were offering their fulldaṇḍavatsin the road. I felt very insignificant, another member of the crowd, and as Prabhupāda walked by me I offered my full obeisances also.\nWhen I lifted my head to get up, however, I saw Prabhupāda’s feet were right there in front of me. I thought, “Oh, my God, Prabhupāda is standing right there.” I very slowly looked up, and Prabhupāda was just standing there looking right at me. He looked me in the eyes for a couple of seconds and then said, “So how long have you been here in Vṛndāvana?” I said, “About six months, Śrīla Prabhupāda.” He just looked at me again, and he was in a very serious mood, very compassionate, gazing into my eyes. He nodded his head and said, “Do you like it here?” I said, “This is the most wonderful place I’ve ever been in my life.”\nThen all of a sudden his serious expression just blossomed into the most beautiful smile. His eyes were glistening radiantly, and he looked at me for about five or ten seconds. It seemed like a real long time – I couldn’t believe the mercy he was giving me – and then he just replied, “That is very nice. Vṛndāvana is a wonderful place.” And then he walked on.\nThis was very special for me, because most of the devotees were always telling me I was inmāyāfor staying in Vṛndāvana and because I was kind of attached to my own program in Vṛndāvana. I was feeling that the devotees didn’t understand, and I was upset with them, thinking that they didn’t appreciate the atmosphere. But Prabhupāda’s words alleviated all my anxieties toward the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. It was the most special personal contact. It wasn’twhatPrabhupāda was saying. It was his personal, transcendental concern for me. So then I went to his classes every day and all thedarśanas,and there was no doubt in my mind. He very much convinced me on every level of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nWhen Prabhupāda left, the devotees told me that I should join and go onparikramawith them all around India, and they said that Prabhupāda had personally invited me to come. I was unbelievably appreciative that Prabhupāda was so merciful, but at the same time I was very attached to Vṛndāvana. I told them I just wanted to stay here, and if they ever came back I would serve Prabhupāda here, but that I didn’t want to leave Vṛndāvana.\nSoon after that, my visa expired. So I had to leave the country. But before I left, the people of Vṛndāvana, especially thebābājīs,were telling me that Swami Bhaktivedanta had establishedNewVṛndāvana in the West. They said, “If you have to leave Vṛndāvana, you should go toNewVṛndāvana. So whatever you do, don’t leave Vṛndāvana. New Vṛndāvana and Old Vṛndāvana are the same, because Swami Bhaktivedanta has created Vṛndāvana in the West.” They said it with great pride. So I left for New Vṛndāvana.\nPrabhupāda trained his disciples in the etiquette of living in Vṛndāvana-dhāma. “In the holydhāma,” he said, “if one of my disciples drinks from a jug incorrectly and he contaminates that jug, everyone will notice it. Don’t be criticized for this uncleanliness, or I will be criticized. It is the duty of the disciple to follow these etiquette habits very austerely. I am putting so much energy into this party in India because I want to train you how to live here.”\nPrabhupāda wrote his disciples in the West of his successful tour of Vṛndāvana.\nDelhiDecember 1, 1971Upon his return to Delhi, Śrīla Prabhupāda, along with the forty disciples who had accompanied him to Vṛndāvana, stayed at the Birla Mandir. The host offered Prabhupāda a small house reserved for special guests in the back of the formal gardens.\nMeanwhile, political turmoil continued to trouble the nation’s capital, as the threat of an all-out war between India and Pakistan increased. Even peaceful Vṛndāvana had been disturbed, being only ninety miles from Delhi and thirty-four miles from Agra, with its large military installation. One night, while Śrīla Prabhupāda had been staying at Saraf Bhavan, the local authorities had ordered a blackout. Śrīla Prabhupāda and the devotees had been confined to their quarters, the electricity had gone off, and everyone had covered their windows with blankets, so that even the candlelight could not be detected.\nNevertheless, despite political agitation and threats of war, Prabhupāda had now come to Delhi to preach. On his second day in the city he visited the American ambassador to India, Kenneth Keating, at the American Embassy.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda explained to Mr. Keating the basic philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness: the distinction between the material body and the self, or soul, living within the body. “You have got this striped coat,” he told Mr. Keating, “but I cannot address you ‘Mr. Striped Coat.’ Yet we are actually being addressed like that. We are identifying with this body.” And Prabhupāda explained the soul’s transmigration through the 8,400,000 species.\n“That is very interesting,” Mr. Keating commented. “I believe in the transmigration of the soul.”\n“It is a fact,” Prabhupāda said. “Just like this child is transmigrating from one body to another” – he indicated Sarasvatī. “In the same way, when I give up this body I will transmigrate to another body. This is a science.\n“I see the American boys and girls, although coming from very rich and respectable families, are turning to hippies. In spite of your arrangement for very big universities, they are becoming frustrated. They are no longer satisfied to live in material opulence. So the present position of human society is dangerous, because everyone is feeling dissatisfied and confused.”\n“Do you have many Indian followers as well as foreigners?” Mr. Keating inquired.\n“Yes, so far as Indians are concerned, everyone accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”\n“Well,” Mr. Keating added, “I am very impressed with the sincerity of these young American men.”\n“Everyone,” said Prabhupāda, “as soon as he understands the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, will accept it immediately.”\n“When Swami Rajanandaji was here,” said Mr. Keating, “I asked him his definition of God, and he thought a minute and said, ‘Well, I would say God is the thread which links one good person to another.’ I thought that was a very interesting definition.”\n“This is stated inBhagavad-gītā,” Prabhupāda said. “Just like you have a pearl necklace, and it is strung on a thread. So all the pearls are resting on that thread. Everyone is resting in God – not that only good men should be resting on that thread. The definition given by theVedānta-sūtrais perfect:janmādy asya yataḥ.‘God is the origin, or source, of everything.’ What do you say?”\n“I am very impressed,” Mr. Keating replied.\n“Another definition of God,” Prabhupāda continued, “is that He is all-attractive. Everyone has the attractive features of opulence, strength, fame, beauty, renunciation, and wisdom to some extent. You are an ambassador, a representative of your country. So you are attractive. Sometimes somebody comes to me, ‘Let me see the Swamiji.’ So this attractiveness everyone possesses. ButGodmeans He who has got all attractiveness in full.”\nAfter some time Ambassador Keating apologized and excused himself for an appointment he had to keep. “I am an ambassador, and I have to move from the sublime to the mundane. I appreciate very much your coming.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “Now I am also coming to the mundane point of view. Next time I come back to the U.S.A. I wish to see the president.”\n“I can write a letter,” Mr. Keating offered. “I will be glad to help you.”\nPrabhupāda smiled. “You are busy helping the whole world so that peace may come and people may be happy. But instead of being happy, the people of your country are becoming hippies – there is some defect. And here is a chance to rectify that defect: Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So let us do something tangible, scientific, so that people will become happy.”\nThat evening Prabhupāda wrote one of his disciples about the meeting:\nThe national emergency had international implications, with America cutting off supplies to India and supporting Pakistan, China threatening India, and Russia supporting India.\n“This war will not last long,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said immediately. “It will soon be finished. And Pakistan will lose.”\nLater that night he heard Indira Gandhi’s broadcast over the radio:\nPrabhupāda was not alarmed. War was not the only “ugly reality”; birth, death, old age, disease, and so many other material sufferings were inevitable – war or no war. Prabhupāda continued to follow the news, however, and some days Śyāmasundara would purchase for him three or four different newspapers.\nAfter a few days at the Birla Mandir, Prabhupāda and his party moved to adharmaśālāin the Kamala Nagar district of old Delhi. There Prabhupāda delivered what the devotees later referred to as “the blackout lectures.” While black-painted newspapers and blankets covered the windows and combat jets flew overhead, Prabhupāda would speak by candlelight to his disciples.\n“The propensity to fight is very strong in this Age of Kali,” he said, “and the population is becoming so sinful that they are trying to accumulate atomic weaponry for ultimate destruction of humanity.” Sometimes Prabhupāda would ask a disciple to speak to the group also. No guests were present, since during blackouts no one could walk the streets, and on some nights the police pounded on the door demanding the devotees extinguish even their candles.\n“Due to the war in India,” Prabhupāda wrote in a letter, “our programs here have been reduced, and there is every night a blackout.” Not only in Delhi but in other parts of India his disciples were encountering difficulties in their preaching attempts. In Māyāpur the government had ordered the devotees to leave the area because of its close proximity to Bangladesh.\nAs Prabhupāda had predicted, however, the war did not last long. On December 17 Prabhupāda read the headlines of theIndian Express –“NIAZI SURRENDERS: BANGLA DESH IS FREE. India Decides on Unilateral Cease-Fire in West.” Prabhupāda was joyous. He told the devotees confidentially that the reason the war had ended so quickly was because of their massivesaṅkīrtana-yajñaat thepaṇḍāla month earlier.\nOn the very same page that had announced India’s victory, however, another headline read, “PM blames USA for war.” Indira Gandhi was blaming President Nixon for the war. The American devotees tensed as they walked the streets, sensing the Indians’ mistrust, and daily newspaper propaganda only worsened the condition. “There is great propaganda now against America in India,” Prabhupāda wrote, “due to the country’s stand against India and the war with Pakistan.”\nDelhi was the seat of much political agitation, and Prabhupāda decided to relocate the devotees who were there with him. Although his disciples were peaceful and far from being politically active, he sent some to Calcutta, while others accompanied him to Bombay. International politics would not stop the oncoming wave of Lord Caitanya’s movement."

        "content": "FROM 1965 UNTIL 1970 Śrīla Prabhupāda had concentrated mainly on reestablishing Kṛṣṇa consciousness in America. His plan had been that if the Americans turned to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the rest of the world would follow. Although his preaching to the English-speaking people had begun in India, some sixty years of singlehanded endeavor there had convinced him that Indians were either too absorbed in politics, too ignorant of their spiritual heritage, or too crippled by poverty to seriously accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore he had not been successful.\nBut in the United States success had come. Clearly, America was the prime field for implanting Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Yet Prabhupāda found the West uncultured and uncivilized. If a trace of civilization remained anywhere, he would often say, it was in India, the heart of the original Vedic culture.\nBy 1970 he had demonstrated through his extensive traveling and preaching that he intended to establish the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement not only in the U.S. but all over the world – especially in India. Even accepting that preaching in the United States and preaching in India were equally important, still the preaching in the United States was going well without Prabhupāda’s constant, direct management; what he had begun, his American disciples could continue.\nBut in India Prabhupāda could not allow his disciples to manage ISKCON. He saw how often and how easily the Indians were able to cheat his disciples. Half of ISKCON’s work in India was being spoiled, he said, due to his disciples’ being cheated. If they put on apaṇḍālprogram, they might end up paying several times the standard cost. The only way for ISKCON to develop in India would be under Prabhupāda’s direct management.\nBeginning in 1970 with a small band of American disciples, Prabhupāda had traveled from place to place in India as a modelsannyāsī,opening a great new field for ISKCON. Now he wanted to construct big temples in India – three in particular: one in Vṛndāvana, one in Māyāpur, and one in Bombay. As early as 1967 he had attempted to make an “American House” for his disciples in Vṛndāvana. Māyāpur, being the birthplace of Lord Caitanya, was especially important. And Bombay was India’s major city, “the gateway to India.” As with most of Prabhupāda’s big plans, even his closest disciples couldn’t fully comprehend the scope of his vision. But Prabhupāda knew what he wanted, and he knew it all depended on Kṛṣṇa. Gradually he began to unfold his plans.\nTemple construction, he said, was secondary to book publication and distribution. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness must run on two parallel lines, just as a train runs on two rails. One rail wasbhāgavata-mārga;the other,pañcarātrikī viddhi. Bhāgavata-mārgareferred to the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, hearing and chanting about Kṛṣṇa and disseminating the message of Kṛṣṇa. The second rail,pañcarātrikī viddhi,referred to the rules and regulations for worshiping the Deity in the temple. Of the two,bhāgavata-mārgawas the more important.\nAlthough great liberated souls like Haridāsa Ṭhākura could remain in perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa constantly, Prabhupāda knew that his disciples, with their restless natures and past sinful habits, needed the special purification of worshiping the Lord in the temple. Therefore, one of his reasons for wanting to establish temples in India was to purify his disciples by giving them elaborate Deity worship.\nTemples, however, were also for preaching. “No one listens to a poor man,” Prabhupāda would say. And he therefore wanted to construct palatial buildings, to attract the masses to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Especially he wanted this in India, where the tradition of temple worship still existed. Building temples and worshiping the Deity was secondary to publishing and distributing books, but it was not to be neglected. Prabhupāda prepared to give temple construction in Māyāpur, Vṛndāvana, and Bombay as much of his attention as necessary.\nBombayNovember 1971For a year the devotees had been living at the Akash Ganga address, two apartments on the seventh floor of a building in the heart of Bombay. But Prabhupāda was not satisfied with this. He wanted land in Bombay, to build on and to expand. He was determined. Instead of his usual morning walks, he would take long rides in his car to observe various parts of the city.\nBecause many of the ISKCON life members lived in aristocratic Malabar Hill, Prabhupāda’s disciples thought it a good place for a temple. On several occasions Prabhupāda rode to the top of Malabar Hill and walked around various properties, considering certain large buildings as possible temples. But for one reason or another he judged them all unacceptable.\nThen in November, a Mr. N. offered to sell ISKCON five acres in Juhu, practically on the shore of the Arabian Sea. As soon as Śrīla Prabhupāda approached the land, he remembered having seen and considered it years before. In August of 1965, during the weeks just before he had left for America, he had been staying at Scindia Colony. In the evenings he had gone to the home of Scindia Steamship Company owner Mrs. Sumati Morarji in Juhu, where he had read and explainedŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamfor her and her guests. Several times he had passed this very property and had thought what a good location it would be for anāśramaand a Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple. Although his attention had been absorbed in the task of leaving India, he had still considered the Juhu land. Now he was again in Juhu, reconsidering the same land he had noticed years before. He took it as a reminder from Kṛṣṇa.\nThe land was overgrown with tall grasses and bushes, and many coconut palms stood throughout. In the back of the property were several tenement buildings. The land bordered on Juhu Road, the main traffic artery back to Bombay, eighteen miles to the south. A broad expanse of beach on the Arabian Sea was a brief walk away.\nThe location was good – peaceful, yet not remote. Several five-star hotels bordered the nearby beach, and developers were beginning work on other hotels and apartment buildings. When Prabhupāda walked along the beach, he liked even more the idea of buying the land. Rich men had weekend homes on the beach, and thousands of Bombayites would be out enjoying the beach on Sundays. Daily, hundreds of Juhu residents used the long, broad seashore for morning walks before going to work. Almost always people were strolling or gathering there, and yet the beach was clean. The mild waves and open skies were inviting. The locale was ideal not only for hotels, but for a Kṛṣṇa conscious center.\nPrabhupāda wanted the Juhu land, and although his disciples continued to show him houses in Malabar Hill, he didn’t change his mind. His disciples wanted whatever he wanted, yet they had trouble developing enthusiasm for a property so far from the city and with no available housing or temple facility.\nMr. N., the owner of the five-acre plot, had set a reasonable price and seemed friendly and sincere. Yet risks were involved in such transactions, and in this case, Prabhupāda even found reasons for suspicion. Through his lawyer, he learned that Mr. N. had previously entered into an agreement to sell this same land to the C. Company but had later cancelled the agreement. The C. Company had then filed a suit against Mr. N. for breach of contract. If the Bombay High Court decided in the C. Company’s favor, the land would be awarded to them. When Prabhupāda’s secretary questioned Mr. N. about this entanglement, Mr. N. assured him the C. Company could not win the suit, but that in any case, ISKCON could withhold a certain portion of their payment until the litigation with C. was settled.\nMr. N. was a well-known figure in Bombay. Formerly the sheriff of Bombay (an honorary judicial police position), he was now publisher-editor of one of the largest daily English newspapers in Bombay. He was wealthy, owning several properties in Juhu and Bombay, and influential – not a man one would want to oppose. To purchase the Juhu land under the present circumstances required boldness.\nIn late December Prabhupāda met with Mr. and Mrs. N. at their home in the Theosophical Colony in Juhu. Mr. N.’s home was on the beach, and thus the visit afforded Prabhupāda another opportunity to appreciate the value and beauty of Juhu Beach, with its border of palms leaning toward the sea. The Theosophical Colony was a private neighborhood of attractive homes with luxuriant lawns and flower gardens and many exotic birds. Ashoka trees grew on either side of Mr. N.’s driveway, and a line of palm trees, standing just inside the massive stone wall, encircled the property. A gardener opened the gate for Prabhupāda and the few disciples with him.\nMr. N. was a short, stocky man with a receding hairline. His hair was clipped short, and his round face was pockmarked. He appeared to be in his fifties. Mrs. N. had a fair complexion and, unusual for an Indian, wore her hair short. Prabhupāda had brought flower garlands andprasādamfrom the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities of ISKCON Bombay, and these he offered to Mr. and Mrs. N. Mr. N. invited his guests to sit with him and his wife on the front porch, which faced a picturesque garden.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda openly expressed his appreciation of the Juhu land but admitted he had very little money. Mr. N., however, seemed inclined toward Prabhupāda and said he wanted to sell him the property. Quickly they reached a verbal agreement. To Mrs. N., however, the agreement seemed too liberal. But when she objected, her husband overruled her.\nPrabhupāda and Mr. N. agreed on a down payment of 200,000 rupees; after making the down payment, ISKCON would immediately receive the conveyance. ISKCON would pay the remaining balance of 1,400,000 rupees later, in regular installments. Prabhupāda negotiated further regarding the down payment, offering to pay 50,000 rupees now and another 50,000 later, at which time ISKCON would be allowed to move onto the land. As soon as they paid the remaining 100,000 rupees, the down payment would be complete, and Mr. N. would give them the deed. Mr. N. agreed.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was always one to think carefully over such business transactions. He had said that if a businessman tells you, “Sir, for you I am making no profit,” you should know he is lying. Therefore, even in ISKCON’s early days in New York City, when the real estate shark Mr. Price had posed as a well-wisher of the devotees, Prabhupāda had been suspicious. Mr. Price had, in fact, cheated the devotees, despite Prabhupāda’s warnings to them. Now, as then, Prabhupāda was suspicious. But he wanted the Juhu land and would take the risk.\nPrabhupāda had taken similar chances. At Jhansi in 1953 he had occupied a building, although he had had little legal standing or financial security. And in his first storefront in New York, as well as in his largest building to date, the Watseka Avenue church in Los Angeles, he had moved in without assurance of the monthly payments. Practically the entire success of his movement had come by his taking one risk after another for Kṛṣṇa. When the devotees in Boston had written to Prabhupāda that they had rented a big house for one thousand dollars a month, calculating that they would be able to make the payments by dramatically increasing theirBack to Godheadsales, Prabhupāda had approved and had even commended their example to others. So if some risks were involved in Bombay, that was only natural.\nOnce committed to the land, Prabhupāda began to unfold his vision for a grand project in Bombay. On December 22 he wrote to Yamunā,\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa explained to Prabhupāda, “We are Westerners. We cannot live like this. We need doorknobs and running water.”\n“Don’t you want to become purified?” Prabhupāda replied.\nWhen the Bombay devotees learned of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s response to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, the words “Don’t you want to become purified?” went deep into their hearts. They knew that Prabhupāda was asking them to become more austere, and that it was for their ultimate benefit. They began to regard moving to Juhu as a formidable spiritual challenge rather than a drudgery. Developing the Juhu property was important to their spiritual master, and it was something greater and more wonderful than they at present realized.\nPrabhupāda knew he was asking his disciples to make a great sacrifice, but he could not avoid it. To preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, a devotee had to be prepared to tolerate many difficulties. And whatever difficulties he was asking his disciples to undertake, he was prepared to undertake to a much greater degree himself. On the one hand, he didn’t think that living on the undeveloped Juhu property would be too difficult for his disciples, provided they maintained cleanliness and chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yet he knew that because they were Westerners, they would find it hard.\nA preacher, nevertheless, had to make sacrifices – not artificially or arbitrarily, but to expand the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Sometimes serving Kṛṣṇa was pleasurable, sometimes difficult. In either case, a devotee had but to do the needful, acting as a menial servant of the spiritual master.\nPrabhupāda counseled his Bombay disciples, impressing on them his vision for ISKCON Bombay. Although all of them were ready to follow his decision, some of them had been feeling doubtful and weakhearted. Seeing their spiritual master’s commitment to the project, however, they vowed to give up their separatist mentalities. Prabhupāda then left for Jaipur, for a week’s preaching engagement at the Rādhā-Govinda temple.\nJaipurJanuary 12, 1972Jaipur is an ancient city in the state of Rajasthan. Occasionally some of Prabhupāda’s disciples would go there to purchase marble Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities for ISKCON temples in India and around the world. The devotees in ISKCON centers in Detroit, Toronto, Dallas, as well as throughout Europe, wanted to install Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities and, with Śrīla Prabhupāda’s permission, were orderingmūrtisfrom Jaipur.\nOn such an errand two women, Kauśalyā and Śrīmatī, had gone to Jaipur in January of 1972 on behalf of the New York City temple. When a government official had discovered Śrīmatī wasn’t carrying her passport, the officials, suspicious of spies due to the war with Pakistan, had insisted the women stay in town until Śrīmatī’s passport arrived in the mail. Meanwhile, the girls had daily visited the Govindajī temple and had sometimes heldkīrtanain the street in front of the temple. They had had daily talks with P. K. Goswami, who was in charge of the temple, as well as Jaipur businessmen and other respectable citizens (almost everyone in Jaipur regularly visits the beloved Deities of Rādhā-Govinda).\nThe citizens of Jaipur had been moved by the devotion of Prabhupāda’s two disciples, and when one of the men had asked, “What can we do to help your movement?” the girls had replied, “Bring Śrīla Prabhupāda here.” Some of Jaipur’s prominent citizens had devised a plan to share expenses and responsibilities in arranging apaṇḍālprogram, and the two women had sent a letter to Prabhupāda in Bombay, inviting him to come and preach. He had agreed.\nAt Śrīla Prabhupāda’s request, devotees from Delhi and other Indian centers came to Jaipur to join him. Prabhupāda took a small room within the Govindajī temple compound, and his disciples moved into a nearby house.\nPrabhupāda liked the location. The only disturbance was the many monkeys – large, charcoal-faced monkeys with long curling tails. Climbing through the trees and across the rooftops, they would scamper down unexpectedly to steal whatever they could. The women cooking for Prabhupāda were exasperated by the monkeys’ bold forays to steal vegetables from the kitchen, evencapātīsright off the fire, and they complained to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“Neither be their friends nor their enemies,” Prabhupāda advised. “If you make friends with them, they will simply be a nuisance. If you become their enemies, they will become very vindictive. Just maintain a neutral position.”\nThe monkeys, however, continued to raid the kitchen. Again the cooks complained to Prabhupāda. “Yes,” Prabhupāda said, “if you want to stop the monkeys, then this is what you must do. Purchase one bow and arrow, and shoot a monkey on the top of a tree with the arrow. And then when he falls down, take the monkey and hang him upside down by the legs to a branch of a tree. Next to him you also hang the bow and arrow. This will teach them.”\nPrabhupāda knew that shooting monkeys was illegal in Jaipur, and he did not expect his disciples to actually shoot them. But he delivered the advice with a serious expression. Indirectly he was advising them not to be so upset over a few monkeys.\nThese were Rūpa Gosvāmī’s original Rādhā-Govinda Deities from Vṛndāvana. Almost five hundred years ago, when a Mogul ruler had attacked the Govindajī temple in Vṛndāvana, the king of Jaipur had arranged for the Deities to come to Jaipur. The worshipers at the Rādhā-Govinda Mandira displayed spontaneous excitement in seeing the Deities. They would come forward, crying, “Jayo! Jayo!” “Govinda! Govinda!” And when the curtains were closing, the people would rush forward to catch a last glimpse of the divine forms. Śrīla Prabhupāda avoided the large crowds before the Deity, keeping to his schedule of rising early and translating theBhāgavatam.\nSpeaking with Kauśalyā and Śrīmatī, Prabhupāda praised them for having arranged the Jaipurpaṇḍālprogram. “You girls are carrying on Lord Caitanya’s movement so nicely,” he said. “Just see! Even without husbands, you go on preaching.” He said that the Western women were different from Indian women, who simply stayed at home.\nThen Prabhupāda discovered that his two women disciples had not actually done a thorough job. Although thepaṇḍālprogram was to begin in two days, no one had arranged for the large tent to be erected. Prabhupāda said it was not a woman’s nature to do such organizational work. The women became morose to hear him. When they showed him the flyer they had printed advertising the festival, Prabhupāda became angry. “It is not standard,” he said. It did not say “International Society for Krishna Consciousness,” but only “A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami and his foreign disciples.”\n“What is this!” Prabhupāda shouted.\n“What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?” Kauśalyā asked.\n“Foreign! Why do you sayforeign?It must be ‘American’ and ‘European’. That is what is attractive, that they are American and European. But you are just a woman. What can I expect?” The two women began to cry and left the room.\nWith Śyāmasundara’s help, Kauśalyā and Śrīmatī had new, corrected flyers printed and returned to tell Śrīla Prabhupāda. But now his mood had changed completely. His anger was gone. He was soft; after all, these disciples had tried their best. In a disarming disclosure, he began to explain that to be a spiritual master was difficult.\n“I chastise you,” he said, “because it is my duty.Discipleisrelated todiscipline,soit is my duty to my disciples. Otherwise, I am not upset with anyone. I simply do this to discipline you, because you are my disciples.” He consoled them, saying they were sincere and lacked expertise because of poor upbringing. The devotees present felt Śrīla Prabhupāda was wonderfully expressing to them a bit of what he, as spiritual master, felt in training them.\nIn a great last-minute endeavor, the devotees obtained thepaṇḍāland erected it in time for Prabhupāda to begin his program as advertised. On opening day the devotees held a parade through the streets, with Prabhupāda riding in a palanquin, a large embroidered umbrella sheltering his head. Also in the procession were decorated elephants, brass bands, and devotees – Indian, American, and European – performingkīrtana.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s first program was in the morning after thedarśanaofGovindajī, so as to catch the huge morning crowd. People would come hurrying into the temple to see Rādhā-Govindajī and then proceed out into the large Hare Kṛṣṇapaṇḍālbeside the temple. On the opening morning Prabhupāda performed anabhiṣekaceremony, bathing marble Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. He named these Deities, soon to be shipped to the ISKCON temple in New York, “Rādhā-Govinda.” After one of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disciples had performed a fire sacrifice, Prabhupāda lectured to the crowd in Hindi. The schedule for the remaining days would be morning and evening lecture,kīrtana,andprasādamdistribution.\nWhile preaching in Jaipur, Śrīla Prabhupāda was simultaneously reflecting on and, through letters to his disciples, acting on matters in many other parts of the world. Although he participated fully, giving two lectures a day, and although he constantly met and interacted with guests, friends, and devotees, he was also absorbed in thoughts of other places and concerns. He was conducting his movement on many fronts. Wherever he happened to be at present was his “camp,” just as a general makes camps in various places while conducting many battles in the overall effort of a war. His preaching in Jaipur, therefore, was only a small fraction of the scope of his worldwide mission.\nFrom Jaipur Prabhupāda wrote his disciples in Calcutta, urging them in their development of the Māyāpur land; he wanted a grand opening ceremony by Lord Caitanya’s birthday in March. Unfortunately, the government was restricting foreigners from entering Nadia, because of its proximity to Bangladesh. “Please try very hard to get those permits,” Prabhupāda urged his men in Calcutta, “as we must be all assembled there for Lord Caitanya’s appearance day.” Repeatedly Prabhupāda mentioned his concern over the government’s restricting his men.\nPrabhupāda wrote ahead to his disciples in Nairobi, driving them onward with his blessings. “Continue to work very hard for His pleasure and all of you will go back to home, back to Godhead.”\nTo the San Diego temple president, Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote,\nAnd Prabhupāda was often thinking of the land in Bombay. Sometimes he talked about it or mentioned it in a letter to his representatives there. The Bombay land purchase was still not finalized, and Prabhupāda was particularly anxious that his disciples pay the money as agreed and move immediately onto the land.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa was Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Governing Body Commission secretary for India. Some of the devotees said that actually Prabhupāda was the G.B.C. secretary for India. Although he allowed his secretaries in other parts of the world to manage mostly on their own and to make their own decisions, in India he would scrutinize even small matters and make most of the decisions himself. Still, he counted on Tamāla Kṛṣṇa as his trusted assistant in important dealings. He would send Tamāla Kṛṣṇa from one Indian center to another to help the local devotees with governmental, legal, organizational, or preaching problems.\nIn Bombay, just prior to coming to Jaipur, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had asked Prabhupāda’s permission to takesannyāsa,the renounced order. Śrīla Prabhupāda had awardedsannyāsato only a few men, and he had specified their duties as “traveling and preaching.” Takingsannyāsa,therefore, not only meant giving up wife and family but also renouncing managerial posts. At the same time as Prabhupāda had set up his Governing Body Commission, he had also initiated severalsannyāsīs,purposefully not appointing any of them, even though they were some of his most able men, as G.B.C. secretaries. Thegṛhasthaswere to manage the temples as presidents and G.B.C. secretaries, and thesannyāsīswere to travel and preach. Śrīla Prabhupāda, therefore, had to carefully consider whether or not to give Tamāla Kṛṣṇasannyāsaand thus lose his G.B.C. secretary for India.\nOn principle, Śrīla Prabhupāda liked the idea of giving Tamāla Kṛṣṇasannyāsa.If a young man was actually qualified to give up family life and to use his intelligence and energy in preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then Prabhupāda was always ready to encourage it. The world was in dire need of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and even hundreds ofsannyāsīswould still not be enough. On these grounds, how could he not appreciate the request of one of his leading disciples to takesannyāsa?But first he would test Tamāla Kṛṣṇa’s determination.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa was insistent. Seeing that Prabhupāda would not make a commitment, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had adopted the tactic of presenting himself before Prabhupāda early in the morning without saying a word. In Bombay he had entered Prabhupāda’s room, led themaṅgala-āratibefore the Deities, and then sat silently before Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nKnowing the mind of his disciple, Prabhupāda could understand that Tamāla Kṛṣṇa was not only determined but obstinate. After several days of tolerating Tamāla Kṛṣṇa’s silent insistent presence every morning, Prabhupāda had finally agreed to consider seriously the request.\nPrabhupāda was also concerned with Mādrī-devī dāsī, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa’s wife. She was an attractive, intelligent girl who had given her life to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, by his own choice, had married her only a year ago. Spiritually, Mādrī was Śrīla Prabhupāda’s daughter, and Prabhupāda wanted to protect her from undue disturbance. Even as householders, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and his wife had been renounced, traveling with Prabhupāda throughout India, with little time or facility for private life as husband and wife.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa had been in Bombay when Śyāmasundara had informed him that Prabhupāda had mentioned in a letter to Brahmānanda Swami in Africa that Tamāla Kṛṣṇa might takesannyāsa.Spurred on, he had left his wife in Bombay and joined Prabhupāda in Jaipur. On leaving, however, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had asked Mādrī for his personal copies of the first three volumes ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,signed by Śrīla Prabhupāda. Mādrī had become suspicious. She had asked why he wanted them. “I just want to read them,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had answered. But she had suspected the worst: “No, you’re not coming back.” But assuring her that he would definitely be returning, he had left for Jaipur.\nOnce with Śrīla Prabhupāda, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa again resumed his silent insistence. Whenever there would be an open meeting in Prabhupāda’s room, the G.B.C. leaders would usually sit in a privileged position near Prabhupāda, so as to best receive direct instruction. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, however, would simply sit outside the door. The first time he did this, Prabhupāda looked up and said, “Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, you are sitting outside? That is very nice,” and the other devotees took it that Prabhupāda was praising his disciple’s humility.\nWhen on one occasion Prabhupāda addressed Tamāla Kṛṣṇa as “Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja,” the devotees were startled. The women devotees in Jaipur, being close friends with Mādrī, became angry at what they took to be Tamāla Kṛṣṇa’s duplicity.\nAlthough Prabhupāda had not given permission, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa went ahead with his plans, even to the point of preparing hissannyāsa-daṇḍaand dying his clothes. The women were outraged; Mādrī was not even there to represent herself. All together the women went to see Śrīla Prabhupāda, who patiently and sympathetically heard their presentation.\nThen Prabhupāda called for Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and said, “Your wife is my daughter, my disciple, and I have to think for her also. So I do not know how I can do this, because she will be in great difficulty.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa argued, but Prabhupāda pacified him and asked him to be patient. Thesannyāsaissue had become a topic of controversy among the devotees in Jaipur. The men were rooting forsannyāsa,and the women were opposed. Prabhupāda, however, remained grave.\nPrabhupāda had also asked several women devotees to carefully observe the Deity worship in Jaipur. They informed him they had observed that every night the Deities were dressed in night clothes and that Their clothes were also changed at two other times, in the morning and in the afternoon. The women told Prabhupāda how a priest offered the Deities scented oils on cotton-tipped sticks, which the priests would later offer, along with flower garlands from the Deities, to the incoming worshipers in exchange for fresh garlands. These devotional practices were standard, Prabhupāda said, and could be introduced throughout ISKCON.\nEach evening Prabhupāda spoke at thepaṇḍāl,and often a respectable Jaipur citizen would introduce him. When the queen of Jaipur introduced him one evening, she expressed her devotional sentiments for Prabhupāda and his movement.\nAfter lecturing each evening, Prabhupāda would stay for a slide show of ISKCON’s activities around the world. One night during the slide show, Śrīla Prabhupāda called Tamāla Kṛṣṇa over beside hisvyāsāsana.“Takingsannyāsawill be difficult now,” he said softly. “Your wife will suffer too much.” He sat back a moment while Tamāla Kṛṣṇa took in what he had said. Then Tamāla Kṛṣṇa leaned forward and said with determination, “One way or another, Śrīla Prabhupāda, she’s going to suffer. Either she’ll suffer now when I takesannyāsa,or if I takesannyāsalater on, she will be just as unhappy. There will never be a time when she’ll want me to. So since the feeling is going to be the same, it might as well come now. Free me. She’ll get over it.”\nPrabhupāda said no more, but he remained thoughtful. Later that night after thepaṇḍālprogram, he called for hissannyāsīdisciples, Subala, Madhudviṣa, Gargamuni, and Devānanda, and for his personal secretary, Śyāmasundara. Gathering them together along with Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, he said, “Tamāla Kṛṣṇa wants to takesannyāsa.So what is your opinion? Should he take or not?”\nEveryone agreed he should. Finally, Prabhupāda consented. “You will have to prepare things,” he said.\n“Things are prepared already,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said.\n“Then,” said Prabhupāda, “tomorrow morning we must have the ceremony.”\nThe next morning Prabhupāda performed a special ceremony in thepaṇḍāl,lighting the sacrificial fire and offering Tamāla Kṛṣṇa thesannyāsa-daṇḍa.The women were angry with Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, but it was too late.\nAfter the ceremony Prabhupāda called Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja to his room. “You have given up a very good wife and a high position. Therefore I am giving you the title Gosvāmī. Now you have to be in the same mood as the Gosvāmīs, being able to preach all over the world and accept disciples.” Suddenly Prabhupāda began to laugh. “I have been testing you,” he said, “to see whether or not you were determined. So what will you do?”\n“I thought I would go with mydaṇḍa,”said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Gosvāmī, “and, without anybody else, simply wander from city to city in India and preach about Kṛṣṇa, without any vehicle or anything, just like Lord Caitanya did.”\n“Very good,” Prabhupāda said. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja offered obeisances and walked out.\nScarcely an hour later, however, Prabhupāda called him back. “This is not a very good proposal,” he said. “If you want to do something, you should have some assistants and facilities at your disposal.” Prabhupāda then assigned a couple ofbrahmacārīsto go with Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja for preaching. He also gave his newsannyāsīhis first assignment. Immediately after Jaipur, Prabhupāda was planning to go to a festival in Nairobi, Africa, yet in Ahmedabad another program awaited him. “You go on my behalf to Ahmedabad,” said Prabhupāda.\nAs Śrīla Prabhupāda was demonstrating, a Vaiṣṇavasannyāsīshould travel all over the world, working with all his might to reclaim the fallen souls on behalf of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Vaiṣṇavasannyāsameant coming to places like Jaipur and preaching. It meant worshiping Govindajī in the temple, and it meant sending Rādhā-Govinda to be worshiped by the devotees in New York City. It meant allowing women an equal opportunity to become pure devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And it meant separating a man from his wife for the higher purpose ofsannyāsa.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda, although beyond thevarṇāśramadesignation ofsannyāsa,was nevertheless the bestsannyāsīand the creator of many othersannyāsīs,whom he instructed to follow in his footsteps. He said hissannyāsīsshould do even more than he – make more followers, publish more books, and establish more ISKCON centers.\nBombayJanuary 24, 1972On returning to Bombay, Prabhupāda was disappointed to find that the devotees had neither paid Mr. N. nor moved to Juhu. Madhudviṣa Swami, whom Prabhupāda had put in charge, frankly admitted his inability to accept the responsibility for such a difficult project. The disciple Prabhupāda had originally deputed to handle such affairs was Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja. But now that he had takensannyāsa,he had renounced his G.B.C. duties for traveling and preaching, and Prabhupāda was without a manager for Bombay. Already Prabhupāda was doing most of the managing, but he couldn’t do everything – he couldn’t stay constantly in Bombay.\nSearching for a veteran disciple to manage Juhu, Prabhupāda thought of Brahmānanda Swami, who was still preaching in Nairobi. Prabhupāda decided to fly to Africa and invite Brahmānanda Swami to come and manage Bombay. He wanted to act swiftly, so that ISKCON could take possession of the land. Even if Mr. N. changed his mind later, once the devotees were living on the land, getting them to leave would be very difficult for him.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda planned to fly to Nairobi immediately, and he wanted to carry large Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities with him. The Deities he had previously sent to Nairobi had been broken in shipping, so this time Prabhupāda brought with him strong-bodied Madhudviṣa Swami to carry the thirty-six-inch marble Deities. With special permission from the airlines, Prabhupāda boarded, followed by Madhudviṣa Swami, who held in his arms the one-hundred-pound Deity of Kṛṣṇa. After setting Kṛṣṇa in place beside Prabhupāda’s seat, Madhudviṣa Swami left the plane and came back carrying Rādhārāṇī.\nPrabhupāda passed most of the flight debating with Madhudviṣa Swami, who took the position of the impersonalist. Prabhupāda would always defeat him. “This is how you become a preacher,” Prabhupāda said. “You must be able to take both sides of the argument and defeat your adversary. This is what Lord Caitanya would do.”\nTypical of Prabhupāda’s stay in Nairobi was his arrival: no one was at the airport to meet him. The devotees were not even sure if Prabhupāda was coming. Prabhupāda’s secretary had phoned Brahmānanda Swami that Prabhupāda was willing to come to Kenya but that Brahmānanda Swami should try to arrange a meeting with the president and schedule a bigpaṇḍālfestival. Brahmānanda Swami, however, had never received a clear message ofwhenPrabhupāda was coming.\nAt the airport Prabhupāda and Madhudviṣa Swami carefully put the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities into a taxicab and rode with Them to the address of the ISKCON center. Prabhupāda rang the doorbell, and when Brahmānanda Swami opened the door and saw his spiritual master, he cried out, “Prabhupāda!” and bowed down.\n“What happened?” Prabhupāda asked, standing beside Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. “Why no one came to pick us up at the airport?” Brahmānanda Swami was unable to reply.\nNo sooner did Prabhupāda arrive than his assistant, Madhudviṣa Swami, became bedridden with hepatitis. Prabhupāda had left his regular secretary, Śyāmasundara, in India to work on a legal case concerning the Māyāpur land, so he was now without a personal assistant.\nThat evening, when the devotees of ISKCON Nairobi gathered in the temple to hear Prabhupāda speak fromBhagavad-gītā,Prabhupāda saw the different items of stolen clothing on the African boys; one boy wore thekurtā,another the top piece, and another thedhotī.Prabhupāda pointed this out to Brahmānanda Swami, who immediately took the boys out and retrieved the clothing from them. When Brahmānanda Swami returned the clothes, Prabhupāda didn’t seem to take the offense seriously, but only laughed.\nPrabhupāda did not laugh, however, at the Nairobi devotees’ bad cooking. When they served him white maize mush, he called it pig food, and the hard, white chickpeas, he said, were suitable only for horses. Then Harikṛpā, a black devotee from America, went to the kitchen, boiled some vegetables, and served them to Prabhupāda without any spicing. Prabhupāda called it dog food. “You are still an uneducated African,” he told Harikṛpā. And he went into the kitchen to cook for himself. Almost a dozen devotees joined him, watching him cook a complete meal ofdāl,rice,capātīs,andsabjī.He cooked enough for all the devotees, and everyone was satisfied. Bad cooking and stolen clothing, however, continued to be problems during Prabhupāda’s week-long stay in Nairobi.\n“Calcutta?” Brahmānanda replied.\n“Calcutta?” Prabhupāda looked at him oddly. “Don’t you know Bombay is number one? Delhi is number two, and Calcutta is number three.”\nPrabhupāda encouraged Brahmānanda Swami to return with him and take charge of the Bombay project. This Bombay project, he said, would be unique within ISKCON, incorporating the religious with the cultural in a gorgeous temple, international hotel, theater, and diorama exhibition. Seeing Prabhupāda’s strong desire, Brahmānanda Mahārāja agreed to somehow relinquish his Nairobi responsibilities to others and help in Bombay.\nIn yet another way Prabhupāda’s visit to Nairobi connected with his Bombay project. When Brahmānanda Swami and Cyavana showed Prabhupāda the Nairobi Hilton, a modern building with twin round towers, Prabhupāda liked the design and wanted to give it to his architect for the Bombay hotel and temple.\n“Oh, yes,” said Prabhupāda.\n“But Prabhupāda,” the boy continued, “if you want to get married in our community, the boy has to pay money to the father of the bride.”\nThis was exactly opposite the Vedic system, Prabhupāda replied, wherein the father of the bride presents a dowry to his son-in-law. Hearing this, Prabhupāda’s new disciple looked worried. He asked, “Then, will you give me money when I want to get my wife? Because I’m not working now, I’m just working for you. When I want to get my wife, will you give me money?”\nPrabhupāda shook his head. “You don’t worry about all of this,” he said “ – whether you’ll get a wife, or whether you will get money, or this or that. Later on, when it is time for you to get married, I will bring one American girl, and you will marry her.”\nPrabhupāda bent down and picked up some pieces of wood. “If they don’t do it,” he said, “then you should do it! Put these over here.” And Prabhupāda began engaging all the men present. Within five minutes the room was neat.\nAlthough the devotees had invited the leading Kenyan citizens to enhance the glorification of Kṛṣṇa, their honored guest, Mr. Komora, used the opportunity to speak in praise of Kenya. Nevertheless, he spoke highly of Prabhupāda and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. RegardingBhagavad-gītā,he said, “Your learned founder has made this great book available in the English tradition with an erudite commentary.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda also attended other engagements in and around Nairobi. He told his Nairobi disciples that in preaching to the Africans they should stress the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa by holding publickīrtanas.Lord Caitanya, he said, spoke philosophy only with learned scholars like Sanātana and Rūpa Gosvāmī, never with ordinary men. “Just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa,” he said. “This should be appreciated.”\n“Who has done this?” Prabhupāda called out loudly. Bhāgavata came running into the temple room. He also was astonished.\n“Who has put Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa ten miles apart?” Prabhupāda demanded. “Don’t you know these things? How many times do I have to teach you?”\nBhūta-bhāvana suddenly appeared, admitting that he was the culprit. “Why are They so far apart?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“I don’t know, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Bhūta-bhāvana. “I guess I just forgot. I was being rushed to go to the festival.”\n“So,” Prabhupāda demanded, “does that mean They should be put out in the street?” Bhūta-bhāvana froze, unable to reply. Prabhupāda relented. “Take Them and put Them together,” he said. “They should not be moved more than three inches apart. Now do it nicely.”\nPrabhupāda envisioned his Bombay project as extraordinary within ISKCON and even among all the temples of India. Many of the details of the project already existed within his mind, but he needed competent disciples to carry them out. He was still the lone leader of ISKCON, forging ahead to bring into reality new phases of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. His disciples were behind him, but it was always he who led. Even when he wanted his disciples as leaders of various ISKCON projects, they sometimes could not handle the responsibility. Therefore Śrīla Prabhupāda had gone to Nairobi in the mood of the Bengali aphorism he sometimes quoted: “If you want to accomplish a thing, do it by your own hand.” So by his own hand he had brought Brahmānanda Swami from Nairobi to Bombay. And simultaneously he had benefited the devotees and the general populace of Nairobi.\nBombayFebruary 8, 1972Prabhupāda met with Mr. N. and reiterated that he wanted to move onto the land as soon as Mr. N. received the second fifty thousand rupees. Mr. N. stood firm on their agreement, and Prabhupāda put the matter into the hands of his lawyer, Mr. D., for legal processing.\nAside from directly managing the Indian projects, Prabhupāda was answering as many as a dozen letters daily from devotees around the world. “Why do they keep writing, asking so many questions?” he asked his secretary.\n“The devotees prefer to ask you personally,” Śyāmasundara said, “because their G.B.C. men don’t always know the right answer.”\n“They know everything by now,” Prabhupāda replied. “I have given you everything. If they don’t know the answer, they can find it in my books. Now I am an old man. Let me settle down to philosophy. All day reading letters, doing business, all night signing letters – this is not right. I want to be free from these things. The G.B.C. can do everything now.”\nBut it wasn’t possible. As soon as Prabhupāda would sense that one of his devotees was being cheated, he would immediately become actively involved. And his disciples continued to write him regarding important business and managerial decisions. Nor would he discourage them. His desire for retirement and exclusive literary work remained, but it seemed to be only a wishful thought, a dream. If ISKCON were to develop, then there seemed little scope for his retirement.\nISKCON would erect a fabulous temple and form a cooperative housing society of devotees of Kṛṣṇa – the first ISKCON city. Respectable men would purchase flats in ISKCON’s highrise condominium. Devotees would have to become expert to develop and operate such a complex, and as they became successful, they would introduce the same pattern in other cities. Businessmen and professional workers could live as devotees in a co-op society, housing their families and sending their children to an ISKCON school.\nPrabhupāda repeatedly talked of constructing an international hotel, somewhat like a Holiday Inn, suitable for foreigners and traveling businessmen, yet reserving a floor for ISKCON life members, who would receive free accommodations. The restaurant would be managed by expertbrāhmaṇacooks, who would prepare dozens of different preparations of sumptuousprasādam.The Deities Rādhā-Rāsavihārī would receive fifty-two offerings daily, and theprasādamwould be distributed to residents and guests.\nTo start things in the right direction, Prabhupāda ordered the devotees to immediately arrange for a ten-day public festival on the new land. First Brahmānanda Swami should pay the agreed balance and move onto the land along with all the devotees and the Deities, Rādhā-Rāsavihārī. Then they should prepare a bigpaṇḍāltent and arrange a full program as they had previously in Bombay, in Calcutta, and in Delhi. Prabhupāda wanted everything ready for his return in two weeks.\nAlthough, as Prabhupāda would sometimes mention, in South India the original Vedic culture was most intact, he had not been there in several years. Most of the greatācāryas, Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, and Madhva, had come from South India, and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, during His own touring, had found South India especially favorable.\nJust after the Hare Kṛṣṇapaṇḍālfestival in Delhi, on the eve of Prabhupāda’s first tour of Vṛndāvana with his disciples, back in November of 1971, Acyutānanda Swami, Brahmānanda Swami, and Girirāja had volunteered to go to Madras to arrange a preaching program for Śrīla Prabhupāda. When Acyutānanda Swami had informed Prabhupāda of the plan, Prabhupāda had asked, “Oh, you are not going to Vṛndāvana with us?”\n“ISKCON is Vṛndāvana,” Acyutananda Swami had replied.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda had said, “my Guru Mahārāja used to think like that.”\n“But which do you want us to do?” Girirāja had asked. “What is the better service?”\n“I want to put on apaṇḍālin Madras,” Prabhupāda had replied. “That would be more pleasing.”\nMadrasFebruary 11, 1972Prabhupāda, accompanied by twenty disciples, arrived in Madras and immediately took part in a parade through the streets. The parade, led by a decorated elephant and a marching band, followed by the devotees’kīrtana,featured Prabhupāda riding in an old, flower-covered American limousine.\nPrabhupāda stayed as the guest of Mr. Balu, a Madrasi businessman. For three nights in the large hall packed with five thousand people, Prabhupāda lectured in English. One evening he told a story from theCaitanya-caritāmṛtaof an illiterate South Indianbrāhmaṇawhom Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu recognized for his staunch devotion to his spiritual master and to theBhagavad-gītā.The next morning and each subsequent morningThe Hindu,one of Madras’s two leading newspapers, printed a full summary of Prabhupāda’s lecture. The other principal newspaper gave a more general account of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami’s arrival and the parade with his Western followers.\nThe large three-day program was followed by a more select gathering, sponsored by Mr. K. Vira Swami, the chief justice of Madras. Attending the function were judges, lawyers, and other leading citizens of the city. Several thousand people gathered beneath the open pavilion as Prabhupāda spoke about Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī of Vṛndāvana, who had given up their important government positions to join the movement of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Indirectly, Prabhupāda was requesting all the attending leaders of Madras to join the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nPrabhupāda was aware that his audience, although respectful, was steeped in impersonalism – deep-seated conviction that impersonal Brahman was supreme and that all Hindu gods were equal manifestations of the One. And Prabhupāda ended his talk by imploring his audience to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. “Just repeat,” he said, “ ‘Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.’ ” His appeal was so urgent and humble that some members of the audience actually repeated aloud, “Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”The Hindu’seditor and publisher, Mr. Kasturi, was in attendance, and he printed a detailed summary of Prabhupāda’s speech in the next day’s paper.\nGirirāja:Prabhupāda wasn’t speaking to them as if they were newspaper reporters. Usually a newspaper reporter has a stereotyped idea of who he is, and you’re giving an interview, so you have your stereotyped idea of who you are. And you answer his questions, thinking of how it will be published. But I could see that Prabhupāda was speaking to these reporters as spirit souls, as individual persons who are meant to be devotees of Kṛṣṇa. Even though they were addressing him as newspaper reporters, he was answering them in a completely different way. He was encouraging them and saying, “This reporting that you have done is very nice. Kṛṣṇa will bless you. Please help spread this movement.” They were asking questions, thinking of his answers in terms of something to publish in the newspapers. But Prabhupāda took it that they were spirit souls reaching out toward Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he answered in that way.\nWithin a few days of Prabhupāda’s arrival, the whole city was feeling the presence of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. Prabhupāda scarcely slept, using the early-morning hours for translating, even after his late-night speaking engagements. He would go from place to place all day with great vitality, outdoing his young followers.\nPrabhupāda’s host, Mr. Balu, although a prominent businessman, was also well known as a religious man. He received Prabhupāda warmly and respectfully, according to proper Vedic etiquette. Prabhupāda noted that Mr. Balu had his own temple with beautiful Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities and a largetulasīplant. When the devotees accompanying Śrīla Prabhupāda asked Mr. Balu why the Deities were often dressed in black, he replied that They were so effulgent that if he didn’t dress Them in black he wouldn’t be able to look on Them. He did not make prostrated obeisances to his Deity because he and his wife were Kṛṣṇa’s father and mother, he said, and how can the father pay obeisances to his son?\nPrabhupāda and his host related to each other graciously. But one night Mr. Balu and his wife came to Śrīla Prabhupāda and asked him to please speak about therāsa-līlā*of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda replied that therāsa-līlā,being the most exalted spiritual topic, was meant only for liberated souls. Only one completely free of material desires, Prabhupāda explained, was fit to hear therāsa-līlā.\n“No, Swamiji,” Mr. Balu insisted. “My wife and I are very keen. You must reciterāsa-līlā.”\nAgain Prabhupāda described the exalted position of therāsadance, repeating that only when one is completely free of all material attachments to wife, family, home, and money could he become fit to hear of Kṛṣṇa’srāsadance. Mr. Balu then folded his hands and politely repeated, “Swamiji, my wife and I plead with you. Please reciterāsa-līlā.”\nThen Prabhupāda replied, “Well, you may be fit to hearrāsa-līlā,but I do not feel that I am qualified to speak it. So kindly ask someone else.”\nHe met with the governor of Madras, K. K. Shah, a staunch Māyāvādī and follower of Śaṅkarācārya. Patiently Prabhupāda tried to teach him Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but the governor would interrupt with his own philosophy. When Prabhupāda asked him to somehow help the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, the man replied that as governor there was nothing he could do, since everything was in the hands of the chief minister.\nResiding in Madras was an elderly scholar and former leading politician who had written several books and translations of Vedic philosophy from the impersonalist point of view. Prabhupāda visited him, but the man was paralyzed and could only sit, trembling, without speaking. Prabhupāda spoke for some time about personalism in theGītā.The old scholar sometimes responded with a glimmer in his eye, but he could only make incoherent sounds. Previously Prabhupāda had criticized this man’s translation of theGītā,which declares that although Kṛṣṇa says surrender unto Him, we don’t actually have to surrender unto the person Kṛṣṇa but to the impersonal, eternal principlewithinKṛṣṇa. The meeting seemed to have a strong effect on Śrīla Prabhupāda, and for days afterward he would sometimes soberly mention how the old Māyāvādī scholar was living almost like a vegetable.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda also met with V. Raj Gopala Acarya (Rajaji), who had been India’s first chief executive after independence. A friend of Mahatma Gandhi, Rajaji was high in the public sentiment as a religious politician. Although in his nineties, he was alert and very sympathetic to Prabhupāda’s movement. Rajaji expressed only one doubt: Prabhupāda had created such a huge institution that now his disciples might identify with the institution rather than with Kṛṣṇa. If that were to happen, then by identifying with the institution they would again fall into the same type of materialism or false identification as before. Prabhupāda replied that because Kṛṣṇa is absolute, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s institution are nondifferent. To identify with Kṛṣṇa’s institution was to identify with Kṛṣṇa directly. Rajaji was satisfied by Prabhupāda’s answer, and after a pleasant conversation the two friends parted.\nPrabhupāda received an invitation to Chief Justice Vira Swami’s home. The two became friends, and the chief justice requested to join the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement as soon as possible. He liked Prabhupāda’s followers, especially three-year-old Sarasvatī, and gave her a six-inch silvermūrtiof Kṛṣṇa playing the flute.\nAnother evening, Mr. Vira Swami came to see Prabhupāda, and Prabhupāda mentioned that he thought Sarasvatī too young to have such a valuable silvermūrtiand that he had taken it from her and was going to give her another one. But while they were talking, Sarasvatī burst into the room and ran to her mother, crying, “Kṛṣṇa is gone!”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then called her forward and asked, “Sarasvatī, where is Kṛṣṇa?”\nIn anxiety, Sarasvatī replied, “I don’t know. Someone took Him.”\nPrabhupāda repeated, “But where is Kṛṣṇa?”\nSarasvatī replied, “I don’t know.”\n“Is He under the cushion?” Prabhupāda suggested. And Sarasvatī ran over to the cushion Prabhupāda pointed to. She picked it up, but Kṛṣṇa was not there.\n“Is He on the shelf?” Prabhupāda asked. Sarasvatī ran to the shelf. Her eyes darted in all directions.\n“Where is Kṛṣṇa?” Sarasvatī began appealing to the faces of the devotees, glancing at their hands, looking behind their backs, searching everywhere.\nPrabhupāda, intently watching Sarasvatī, began reciting a verse about the six Gosvāmīs:he rādhe vraja-devike ca lalite he nanda-suno kutaḥ.“This is the mood of the Gosvāmīs,” he said. “They never said, ‘Now I have seen God. Now I am satisfied.’ No, rather they were saying, ‘Where is Rādhā? Where is Kṛṣṇa? Where are You all now? Are You on Govardhana, or are You under the trees on the bank of the Yamunā? Where are You?’ In this way they expressed their moods of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nSarasvatī’s anxiety had become heightened to the point of tears. One of the devotees then hinted, “Sarasvatī, where is Kṛṣṇa?Whohas Kṛṣṇa?” Sarasvatī’s eyes widened. She exclaimed, “Prabhupādahas Kṛṣṇa!” and she rushed up to Prabhupāda, convinced that he was holding Kṛṣṇa. And Prabhupāda reached behind his seat and pulled out a small Kṛṣṇamūrtisimilar to the silver Kṛṣṇa he had taken from her.\n“Here is Kṛṣṇa, Sarasvatī” Prabhupāda said. Sarasvatī was in ecstasy. All the devotees were struck by Prabhupāda’s exchange of devotional feelings with even a small child; by his expertise he had created within her a mood of separation from Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda continued explaining to the chief justice about the mood of separation from Kṛṣṇa.\nIn talking with his disciples, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “The chief justice isbrāhmaṇa? I don’t think so. He may be akṣatriya.But you can tell him that we can solve the whole problem between thebrāhmaṇasand the non-brāhmaṇas.We will give facility that anyone can become abrāhmaṇa.He simply has to follow our principles, and we will make him abrāhmaṇa.” Prabhupāda said theśāstrastates that in Kali-yuga the demons will take birth asbrāhmaṇas,thus this deep controversy. The so-calledbrāhmaṇas,the leaders, were not satisfying the people. Prabhupāda said that anyone who followed the four regulative principles, chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa, and took Vaiṣṇava initiation could become abrāhmaṇa,and that would solve the whole problem.\nThey should begin, Prabhupāda said, by making Chief Justice Vira Swami abrāhmaṇa.Mr. Vira Swami admitted that he was already eager to take initiation from Śrīla Prabhupāda; his only difficulty was giving up tea-drinking. When Prabhupāda heard this, he said that even if the justice did drink a little tea, he would accept him – as an exceptional case.\nSome of Madras’s caste-consciousbrāhmaṇascriticized Śrīla Prabhupāda’s creatingbrāhmaṇasfrom low-born Westerners. During a gathering at the home of a Madrasibrāhmaṇa,one of the guests commented to Prabhupāda, “Swamiji, your disciples don’t pronounce the Sanskrit very nicely. Even the Hare Kṛṣṇamantrathey sometimes do not say correctly.”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied, “that is why we have come here – to get your association so you can teach us.”\nThey talked again, but remained unsatisfied. Girirāja then informed Prabhupāda and asked if he would meet Mr. Ramakrishna himself. Prabhupāda agreed.\nWhen they met, Mr. Ramakrishna began by saying, “Swamiji, we have been having some discussion about devotion to Lord Kṛṣṇa and devotion to Lord Śiva. What do you say? Who is greater? Kṛṣṇa or Śiva?”\nPrabhupāda replied that actually the wordbhakti,or “devotion,” could not properly be applied to the worship of Lord Śiva.Bhakti,he said, meant service without any material desire, whereaspūjāincluded service with the desire for some return.Bhakti,therefore, could only be applied to Kṛṣṇa.\n“But isn’t it possible,” asked Mr. Ramakrishna, “for someone to be abhaktaof Lord Śiva and to worship Lord Śiva simply out of devotion, without desiring any material benefit?”\n“It may be possible,” Prabhupāda replied, “but generally not. Just like when a person enters a liquor shop, generally it’s taken that he is going for drinking, although there may be some exception.”\nPrabhupāda gave the example of thegopīs’worship of the goddess Kātyāyanī; their worship had not been for material benefit but for devotion to Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, if one worshiped Lord Śiva with the aim of serving Lord Kṛṣṇa, that would bebhakti.But people generally approach Śiva for material benefit. Although Mr. Ramakrishna was usually prone to argue these points, Prabhupāda’s answer satisfied him.\nAlthough Śrīla Prabhupāda was surprised and hurt by the extreme virulence of such a letter, he was accustomed to his Godbrothers’ slights and insults. He forbade his disciples, however, to get involved in fights with his Godbrothers. Rather, they should simply avoid them. He said that persons who criticize the spreading of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement were useless and that he would push on: “The dogs may bark, but the caravan will pass.”\nIn contrast to the venomous letter came a letter from Tridaṇḍī Svāmī B.V. Purī Mahārāja, another of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Godbrothers. Purī Mahārāja, as Prabhupāda called him, had a smallāśramain Visakhapatnam, on the Bay of Bengal between Madras and Calcutta. Hearing that Prabhupāda was going next to Calcutta, Purī Mahārāja invited him to visit.\nVisakhapatnamFebruary 17, 1972A broad beach of white sparkling sands and the Bay of Bengal’s warm, clear waters were special features of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s visit to Visakhapatnam. Purī Mahārāja’s smallāśrama,where Śrīla Prabhupāda stayed, was only five minutes from the ocean, and every morning Prabhupāda and his entourage of about fifteen devotees would take long walks along the seashore.\nYamunā:Idon’t think Prabhupāda ever excluded any of us from going with him to the beach. All the devotees knew at which time Śrīla Prabhupāda would be taking his walk, and we would come out from our different quarters and follow him to the seashore. The walks were brisk and refreshing and full of talk about Kṛṣṇa. Somehow or other, we were all able to hear Śrīla Prabhupāda speak.\nGurudāsa:Ialways went on every morning walk. But one time I was sitting in the temple, when suddenly I saw Prabhupāda and the devotees going toward the beach. I immediately ran out of the temple to join them, without even taking time to get my shoes. But there were barnacles and rocks leading down to the beach. When Prabhupāda saw me coming, lifting my feet up high, painfully hobbling down the rough road, he looked over and said, “Oh, your feet are hurting? Why aren’t you wearing shoes?” And I said, “Prabhupāda, when I’m with you, I don’t feel any pain.” Prabhupāda stopped and said, “Then why don’t you cut your throat?” Everyone laughed, and I laughed also. He said, “There is enoughtapasya.Why create your own?”\nGurukṛpā:Prabhupāda would talk philosophy on and on. There were many things I couldn’t understand. I would just listen anyway, although I couldn’t remember anything. I would just hear and hear, but it hadn’t registered yet. I used to walk behind him on the beach, and I figured that, “If I can’t follow his teachings or example yet, at least let me step in his footsteps in the sand.”\nViśākhā:Sometimes a dog would try to follow us or would bark at us. We were all surprised to see how Prabhupāda would flick his cane and the dog would run away. Once when we passed a cow on the road, Prabhupāda gave her ample room to pass, and he told us the story of how he had been gored by a cow shortly after he had takensannyāsa.\nTejās:Once on a morning walk Prabhupāda was speaking about the dog. He gave a reference to aślokaby Cāṇakya Paṇḍita about the five good qualities of a dog – that he is very faithful and satisfied with anything. And soon Prabhupāda said we should be Kṛṣṇa’s dog. He was also speaking about how ourpūjārīsshould never be paid. The teacher and thepūjārīshould never receive a salary. They must work in pure devotion. Thekṣatriyaalso. He said that was the mistake in government today, that the kṣatriyas are being paid. He discussed so many things, one after another.\nNanda-kumāra:Śrīla Prabhupāda would tell us to go bathe in the ocean. “Go to the beach,” he would say. So one day I asked him, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, whenever I go down to the beach, the sun is warm on my body, the water feels so good, the sand – it seems like such a comfortable material situation. How should I understand your reason for asking us to go to the beach? I know the spiritual master never gives the disciple anything that will cause him to become materially attached but always gives him whatever he needs to remember Kṛṣṇa. But when I go to the beach, it seems I just enjoy my senses. How can I relate that to Kṛṣṇa? How can I understand that this instruction is for my spiritual benefit?”\nPrabhupāda said, “The sun is there – Kṛṣṇa is the light of the sun. The ocean is there – Kṛṣṇa is the taste of water. You aresurroundedby Kṛṣṇa. How can you forget Kṛṣṇa? He is all around you.”\nPāñcajanya:I was a new devotee, and I asked Prabhupāda, “What about swimming, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Is that notmāyā?” Prabhupāda said, “Lord Caitanya used to go swimming all the time. He used to play ball. So you can go and swim. Just make sure you remember Kṛṣṇa.”\nPrabhupāda’s disciples had already seen formal exchanges of obeisances between Prabhupāda and his Godbrothers, as when in Bombay they had seen Prabhupāda get off hisvyāsāsanaand offerdaṇḍavatsto his Godbrothers. But in Visakhapatnam they saw more intimate dealings. They saw for the first time Śrīla Prabhupāda living comfortably, at ease, in the same quarters as his Godbrothers. And they didn’t feel themselves being treated condescendingly or superficially, or being regarded as oddities. Through Prabhupāda’s guidance they began to learn more of the essential friendly and humble exchanges between Vaiṣṇavas.\nPrabhupāda’s Godbrother Ānanda was eager to cook and serve not only Śrīla Prabhupāda but all his disciples. Ānanda was elderly, and yet he took the position of always offering menial service. Although he spoke very little English, Prabhupāda’s disciples could perceive the affection of Ānanda and Śrīla Prabhupāda for each other. Ānanda’s communication with Prabhupāda’s disciples was particularly through his cooking and servingprasādam.\nEach morning everyone would gather on the veranda outside Prabhupāda’s quarters, the men sitting on one side, the ladies on the other. Down the center aisle Ānanda would walk briskly, distributingprasādam,while Prabhupāda sat at one end in a wooden chair, fingering hisjapabeads and observing the devotees takeprasādam.Prabhupāda had supplied money to theāśrama,and Ānanda was regularly cooking sumptuous feasts: deep-fried chunks of potatoes in powdered spices, rice, yogurt,dāl,three different types ofsabjīs,french fries, chutney,malpurā, rājkeli, sandeśa, kṣīra –and everything cooked to a nectarean standard of excellence.\nPrabhupāda would sit at the head of the two rows of devotees and encourage them to takeprasādam:“Give him more!” Prabhupāda would praise Ānanda’s cooking, smiling with pleasure to see his disciples acceptprasādam.The devotees would finish, having been induced to eat as much as they possibly could, and Śrīla Prabhupāda would say aloud theprema-dhvani.Then allthedevotees would shout in response, “Jaya!”\nAfter one such feast, Prabhupāda called the devotees into his room and remarked, “See how he is cooking. He cooks everything, he serves it, and then he doesn’t eat until everyone is fully satisfied. This is Vaiṣṇava, how he should act. He is more satisfied to serve than to enjoy himself.” The feasts continued twice a day, and in the evening many guests arrived to takeprasādam,chant in thekīrtanas,and hear Śrīla Prabhupāda lecture.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda chose to approach the temple by car, riding up the winding road past orchards of mango, jackfruits, and cashew, and fields of pineapple. On arriving at the temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda and his disciples met one of the templebrāhmaṇas,who showed them around the grounds. The temple buildings were of black granite, and carved into the rock were the forms and pastimes of Viṣṇu, especially in His incarnation of Lord Nṛsiṁha. As Prabhupāda moved from place to place, building to building, he sometimes rode up steep stairs on a palanquin carried by four men.\nWhen Prabhupāda came upon an immense banyan tree at the lower end of the temple grounds, he said that the tree must be thousands of years old. As he stood beneath the tree, his servant, Nanda-kumāra, handed him a smallcampakaflower. Extending his thumb and forefinger from his bead bag, Prabhupāda held thecampakaflower and looked fondly at it. “This flower,” he said, “is the color of Lord Caitanya. And this flower is the most loved all over India. This flower is beautiful to look at and beautiful to smell.” He carried the small saffron-gold flower between his fingers throughout the rest of the morning.\nWhen Prabhupāda and his group entered the inner sanctum, where the Deity of Lord Nṛsiṁha resided, their guide explained that themūrtidated back to the time of Prahlāda Mahārāja. An ancient king named Purūravā and his consort Urvaśī had once visited this hill, and at the request of Urvaśī, themūrti,who appeared to her in a dream, had been excavated. The Lord had ordained that He should be worshiped in this place but that He would givedarśanaonly one day a year, during the month of Vaiśākha. The rest of the year He would be entirely covered with ground sandalwood pulp mixed with camphor and other scents. Therefore, the Deity now appeared to be only a lump covered with a layer of sandalwood. Prabhupāda commented that the sandalwood was to keep the Deity “cool-headed.”\nMādhavānanda:When Prabhupāda was at the Nṛsiṁha temple in Visakhapatnam, it was the same as when he was in Vṛndāvana. When he got out of the car, he was very grave. We went into the temple, and there was a chamber. Then we went down. The walls were four feet thick, and it seemed like hundreds of feet of tunnels before we got into the inner sanctum. There was the Deity with just a mound of sandalwood paste on Him. As soon as we entered, Prabhupāda said, “Begin chanting the Nṛsiṁhamantra.” So we started singingtava kara-kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-śṛṅgam.And we circumambulated the Deity. Then we stood before the Deity, and Prabhupāda offered obeisances.\nGurukṛpā:When we came into the Deity room, Prabhupāda had us sing the Nṛsiṁha prayers. He always manifested such devotion. That was what separated him from us – not only his learning or his knowledge, but his devotion. In these places we would see him become very silent, very grave, and when he would speak, such peace would fill us from within. When he would speak, you could feel it. He was constantly convincing us of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Not purposely, but he was just being himself. In these places it would come out.\nWhen Prabhupāda stood with us before the Deity, we couldn’t even see. There was just a mound of sandalwood. There was onebrāhmaṇawith big earlobes, and he had a ring in his ear. We offered some money. But it was a very devotional time. Prabhupāda didn’t say much, and the main reason was that these places are appreciated according to one’s spiritual advancement. The details and facts and the history are not really that important. There is nothing really to say. Prabhupāda would just make sure we had the proper respect and didn’t commit any offense.\nAt another program a bearded American anthropologist rode up on a motorcycle to attend Prabhupāda’s lecture andkīrtana.Afterward, the anthropologist told Śrīla Prabhupāda that he had come to India to study the primitive tribes. Prabhupāda told him it was simply a waste of time. “Why do you want to study the primitive people?” he asked. “Why don’t you study the exalted people?” And Prabhupāda narrated a story:\nOne time a poor man roasted a cob of corn and then began picking off the kernels one at a time and eating them. In this way it took him many hours to finish. He did this, Prabhupāda said, because he had nothing else to do, just to pass the time of day. In the same way, the study of anthropology was simply a waste of time. Prabhupāda asked, “Why don’t you study some person or group of persons from whom you can learn something?”\nRepeatedly Prabhupāda invited Purī Mahārāja to come and preach in the West. He requested him to at least come to Māyāpur for ISKCON’s international gathering of devotees. Prabhupāda felt that Purī Mahārāja, on seeing all the Western disciples, might feel moved to join him and preach. Purī Mahārāja agreed to accompany Prabhupāda to Calcutta and Māyāpur, and the pleasant week in Visakhapatnam came to an end with Prabhupāda, his disciples, and Purī Mahārāja looking forward to traveling together to Calcutta.\nGurukṛpā:Although we arrived at the train station early, the train was already at the platform. It was very hot, and five or six of us were havingkīrtana.Then Śyāmasundara climbed up a coconut tree and got this fantastic coconut. He opened it and gave it to Prabhupāda, who proceeded to drink a lot. Then Prabhupāda gave it to Śyāmasundara, and Śyāmasundara drank. Then Prabhupāda said, “Give it to thekīrtanamembers.” Each man in thekīrtanagroup was so thirsty that he wasn’t even thinking of leaving any for the next man but would just pass this coconut around. And the thing wouldn’t empty. I tilted it up, and the coconut water was coming out, pouring on my shirt, and I was drinking and drinking. But still it wouldn’t empty. We were amazed. Prabhupāda was smiling, and we were chanting. We all became cool and satisfied.\nŚyāmasundara:Prabhupāda and I were in a first-class railway coach, a private compartment for two persons, clackity-clacking through the warm Indian night, somewhere between Visakhapatnam and Calcutta. Prabhupāda was talking and joking and playing tapes until around ten-thirtyP.M.,when he lay down to take rest. For a while I switched off the lights. At about midnight Prabhupāda sat upright and called my name. “Śyāmasundara, take dictation,” he said. Then followed a train of thoughts so lucid and coherent that I could only conclude that while we think Śrīla Prabhupāda is sleeping he is usually not sleeping but is thinking, reflecting on ways to serve Kṛṣṇa more and more."

        "content": "PRABHUPĀDA HAD POSTPONED the Māyāpur cornerstone-laying ceremony until Gaura-pūrṇimā (the appearance day of Lord Caitanya), February 29, 1972. He had requested a big festival, with apaṇḍāland free feasting for guests. His disciples from all over the world would attend.\nIn December, when the war had broken out between India and Pakistan over Bangladesh, near Māyāpur, the Indian government had forbidden foreigners to stay in the northern area of West Bengal. The devotees had vacated, returning a few weeks later when the war had ended. They had continued arranging for the festival, and a few days before Gaura-pūrṇimā Prabhupāda arrived to stay with them.\nWhen Prabhupāda saw a banner on bamboo poles – “Welcome Śrīla Prabhupāda!” – he remarked, “I don’t know if my Godbrothers will like this.” He had already heard that some of his Godbrothers objected to his taking the same title as their spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda. He had not actuallytakenthe name, but his disciples hadgivenhim the name a few years ago in America. In May 1968 while in Boston, Prabhupāda had been dictating a letter and had mentioned to his secretary that Swamiji was a third-class title for the spiritual master. “Then why do we call you Swamiji?” his secretary had asked.\n“The spiritual master,” Prabhupāda had replied, “is usually addressed by names like Gurudeva, Viṣṇupāda, or Prabhupāda.”\n“May we call you Prabhupāda?” his secretary had asked.\nPrabhupāda had replied, “Yes,” and his disciples had switched from “Swamiji” to “Prabhupāda.” One of the devotees had inquired further from Prabhupāda about the meaning of the word and had published a statement inBack to Godheadmagazine.\nEveryone concerned had been happy about the title Prabhupāda, and no one had foreseen the envy the name would uncover. How could Prabhupāda compete for the honor due his own spiritual master? He was fixed as the humble servant of his spiritual master.\nThe members of ISKCON saw no harm in calling their spiritual master Prabhupāda. And there could be no stopping them – he was their Prabhupāda. They had even printedA. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupādaon their invitations for the Gaura-pūrṇimā festival. But Prabhupāda knew it would raise the eyebrows of certain of his more critical Godbrothers.\nWell aware that Westerners were unaccustomed to the austerities of living in India, Prabhupāda wanted to provide facilities so his disciples could feel comfortable and be able to focus their stay in India on spiritual life, without distracting inconveniences. Therefore he was pushing them to help in various ways to establish a Māyāpur building with running water, electricity, and other conveniences.\nPrabhupāda’s dwelling was a simple thatched Bengali hut about twelve feet square, with a dirt floor. A thin partition divided the main room from the servants’ quarters. In front was a small veranda, and in back a garden, where Prabhupāda could sit and take massage. Also in back were a hand pump for bathing and an outhouse. When the devotees apologized for offering Prabhupāda such a humble residence, he replied that he liked the natural simplicity. “Even if you build me the biggest palace,” he said, “still I would prefer to live here.”\nWhile living so simply in Māyāpur, Prabhupāda spoke of his vision of a grand project yet to come. Although the Deities of Rādhā-Mādhava –  whom he had worshiped at the 1971 Ardha-kumbha-melā in Allahabad –  were installed in a tent, he spoke of a marble palace. He also spoke of first-class accommodations for guests and devotees, although as yet he had little to offer. Living simply and happily in his thatched hut, he gathered his disciples together and told them of his plans. At his request, devotees had built a small model of the proposed first major building, and there were also drawings of the proposed Temple of Human Understanding. He wanted to build a Māyāpur city, he said, with quarters for each of the four social classes of thevarṇāśramainstitution.\nTatpara: When Prabhupāda would go to the Western countries, he would be interviewed by many great persons, but when he came to Māyāpur, he was talking so friendly, sometimes taking juice or giving instructions, and he lived simple, like a villager. The Western devotees think sometimes of Prabhupāda in onelīlāonly, like a great king. But when he comes to India, he is like another person. He was laughing and talking like a friend.\nBhavānanda:In his straw house Prabhupāda sat on a bamboo platform. There was a bed and some mats on the floor. That was all. He was happier there than anywhere. We put a fan in there too, and Prabhupāda liked it. He liked it because it was so simple. There was an outhouse, but he didn’t mind it at all. He was relishing everything. At that time he made Jayapatāka and me codirectors of Māyāpur. He made four signers on the checking account for the building construction. In India, just to open up an account is very difficult. We were seeing that part of Prabhupāda, where he was very strict because he knows the difficulties you can run into. If you don’t fill out the proper forms, the bank can even keep your money. Or you may want to close your account and they won’t let you. Our mood was splayed out – we were babies. So Prabhupāda was training us in keeping accounts and management.\nJananivāsa:The first time Prabhupāda came to see the Deities, he said, “Who is dressing the Deities?” Someone said, “Jananivāsa.” The Deities were just standing on a tile platform with no decoration. They were just standing there, but Prabhupāda looked on Them so lovingly. He used to come and takedarśanaevery day. One time he came to the Deity room and I wasn’t there. There were some Indian people takingdarśana,and I had gone to get them aBack to Godheadmagazine from a room about ten feet away. When I came back, Prabhupāda was there. He was also takingdarśana,but he said, “You should always be standing here. People are coming, but no one is here.” I said, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, I just went to get aBack to Godhead.It is only ten feet away.” But he looked at me as if to say, “You are defending yourself again, making excuses.” Then he told Bhavānanda, “This boy, Jananivāsa, should have some help. He can’t do everything. He is an ordinary person.”\nThe five-day Gaura-pūrṇimā festival featured twenty-four-hourkīrtana,with groups of devotees chanting in two-hour shifts. Each morning the main body of devotees would form akīrtanaprocession and go out visiting Navadvīpa’s holy sights: thenīmtree under which Lord Caitanya was born, the house of Śrīnivāsa Ācārya, where Lord Caitanya and His associates had performed nocturnalkīrtana,the spot where the Kazi had tried to stop Lord Caitanya’ssaṅkīrtana,the residence of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. (Often Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura had stood in front of this house, Prabhupāda told the devotees, and looked out across the Jalāṅgī toward where Śrīla Prabhupāda now had his land.)\nThroughout the day and especially in the evenings, the devotees would gather on the stage of the orange-stripedpaṇḍāl,while Rādhā-Mādhava stood at stage center within a traditional Bengalisiṁhāsanaof carved banana stalks covered with colored foil and flower garlands. Prabhupāda would have his disciples do most of the public speaking, with Acyutānanda Swami, lecturing in Bengali, as the main speaker.\nHundreds of people came and went in a steady stream, and the devotees distributed Bengali, English, and HindiBack to Godheadmagazines. In the evenings they would present a slide show or a film. Prabhupāda was especially pleased to watch theprasādamdistribution from his window, hundreds of villagers squatting in long rows, eatingkicharīfrom round leaf plates. “Continue this forever,” Prabhupāda told his disciples. “Always distributeprasādam.”\nEven without a building, Prabhupāda’s preaching in Māyāpur was significant. While other nearbymaṭhaswere also observing Gaura-pūrṇimā – mostly by hosting Calcutta widows who paid a fee to live a few days in a temple and visit the holy places of Navadvīpa – Prabhupāda’spaṇḍālprogram was the most vigorous celebration and drew the most visitors. The birthplace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Prabhupāda said, had no meaning without preaching. Except for this time of the year, very few people visited Māyāpur.\n“Which is more important,” Prabhupāda asked, “Lord Caitanya’s birthplace or His activities? It is His activities, Hiskarma.His activities are more important than Hisjanma,or place of birth.” The activities of Lord Caitanya were chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and distributing love of God to all people, and this should be the activity of devotees in Māyāpur.\nSitting on a cushion next to the sacrificial arena, chanting onjapabeads, Prabhupāda initiated six Bengali devotees and awarded thesannyāsaorder to a young American disciple. Then Prabhupāda’s Godbrothers spoke, each expressing appreciation of Prabhupāda’s work in the West.\nFinally they all gathered around the pit, five feet square and fifteen feet deep. Certain articles had been collected to be placed inside the pit in accordance with the scriptures: five kinds of flowers, five kinds of grains, five kinds of leaves, five kinds of metal, five kinds of nectar, five kinds of colors, five kinds of fruits, and five kinds of jewels. Prabhupāda’s Godbrother Purī Mahārāja descended a ladder into the pit to put coconuts and banana leaves in a pot and to place this, along with flowers, onto the altar of bricks.\nNext Prabhupāda entered the pit, carrying a box with a gold, ruby-eyedmūrtiof Ananta Śeṣa. Earlier that morning in his hut Prabhupāda had confidentially shown a few disciples themūrti.“This is Lord Ananta,” he had said, “the serpent bed on which Lord Viṣṇu rests. He will hold the temple on His head.” Prabhupāda now placed Ananta Śeṣa on the altar of bricks and climbed back up the ladder. Then on Prabhupāda’s blissful invitation, everyone began to toss in offerings of flowers and money, followed by handfuls of earth.\n“I did not take it,” Prabhupāda replied. “They are calling me Prabhupāda. What can I do?” Although thesannyāsīGodbrother then began to criticize Prabhupāda for not joining their preaching and for awarding the sacred thread andsannyāsaorder to Westerners, mainly the Godbrothers wanted an explanation for his use of the title Prabhupāda.\n“Brahmānanda Mahārāja!” Prabhupāda called. “Bring me a copy of my letterhead.” When Brahmānanda Swami returned with the stationery, Prabhupāda showed it to his Godbrothers. The letterhead read, “Tridandi Goswami A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.” No “Prabhupāda.” This proved that he himself did not use the title. This simple demonstration pacified his Godbrothers, and he then invited them to takeprasādamwith him, while his disciples served.\nLater in his hut Prabhupāda talked with his disciples about envy. A devotee could judge his own advancement by how free he was from envy, he said. In the spiritual world envy was conspicuous by its absence. Although all the liberated associates of Kṛṣṇa were trying their best to serve Kṛṣṇa – in a kind of competition – everyone was pleased with one another. If Rādhārāṇī or a favoritegopīpleased Kṛṣṇa, the othergopīsdid not think ill of her but thought, “Oh, how nicely she has served Kṛṣṇa. Let me try to offer some nice service to Kṛṣṇa so He will be even more pleased!” To be envious was materialistic.\nPrabhupāda wished his Godbrothers had taken a different point of view. He wished they had not minded his being called Prabhupāda by his disciples. He was also sorry that some of his Godbrothers couldn’t sincerely praise his work. If Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī was working successfully through him, why should they be disturbed? Why not accept his work and be happy that the mission of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was being spread effectively? They should see it as Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī’s work, the work of their own spiritual master. It was alsotheirwork,theirresponsibility, and they should recognize that through Bhaktivedanta Swami Mahārāja it was being wonderfully done. At the ceremony they had praised his work. So if they didn’t mind praising him, then why not admit that for hundreds of Westerners whom he had saved from hell, he was Prabhupāda, that singular pure devotee whom they always thought of as seated at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.\nIn terms of authorized books produced and distributed, numbers of devotees initiated and engaged in devotional service, and numbers of temples opened, no one could compare. Of course, in one sense all of Prabhupāda’s Godbrothers were equally praiseworthy, as long as they followed the basic instructions of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa, and avoided sinful life. But if analysis or criticism was to be made with such scrutiny, then let the preaching records be scrutinized. Who, above all, was extending the mercy of Lord Nityānanda and making such tremendous gains on behalf of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī – gains that had previously seemed impossible? According toCaitanya-caritāmṛta,if a preacher could spread the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, then he must be accepted as empowered by God.\nPrabhupāda was certainly empowered, yet he conducted himself very humbly, with no assistance from others. He had repeatedly invited his Godbrothers to join him in the West and take their places beside him as preachers in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Why had they not come forward to assist him in their spiritual master’s mission, instead of complaining about him, the one Godbrother who was carrying out Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī’s mission?\nIt was not the place of Prabhupāda’s disciples to criticize, however, and he had sternly warned them that they had no position to do so. They should treat his Godbrothers as disciples of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī and therefore as on the level of their own spiritual master. Nevertheless, Prabhupāda’s disciples became sorry to see this lack of respect for their spiritual master. They could be humble and not protest, but how could they be affectionate toward persons who criticized their spiritual master and his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement?\nFebruary 1972During Prabhupāda’s absence from Vṛndāvana the devotees had been unable to persuade Mr. S. to grant legal permission for ISKCON to use the land. Prabhupāda had insistently directed one of his Indian-born disciples, Kṣīrodakaśāyī, to acquire from Mr. S. an actual deed. Kṣīrodakaśāyī had pleaded with Mr. S., and seeing Mr. S.’s indecision, he had spoken with Mrs. S. and then with the two of them together.\nMr. and Mrs. S. had agreed that since they could not decide, they would put the matter before Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī Herself. Mrs. S. had asked Kṣīrodakaśāyī to take two slips of paper and to writeyeson one andnoon the other. These she had folded and placed before the family Deity of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. She had then asked Kṣīrodakaśāyī to pick one of the papers. Kṣīrodakaśāyī had done so, and in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. S. and Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, he had opened the piece of paper on which was written the word yes.\nWhen Prabhupāda had heard the news, he had been joyous.\nYamunā:It just so happened that on the morning that thegosvāmīswere to sign an agreement with Prabhupāda for use of the rooms at Rādhā-Dāmodara, the electricity went out. Prabhupāda’s secretary had only an electric typewriter, so I reminded Prabhupāda that I was trained in writing calligraphy. I had my writing pens with me, so immediately Prabhupāda drafted the writing that he wanted, and I took it into another room, sat down, and hand-lettered a contract with gold embossing on all the capitals. Within fifteen minutes we presented it to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nBefore thegosvāmīs,Prabhupāda held up the document with pleasure and said, “Just see, my disciples are expert in everything.” Now the devotees would be allowed to reside above his rooms at Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, and they would also have access to his rooms for cleaning. Prabhupāda felt it was a grand occasion that there was something in writing for the preservation of his rooms in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple.\nTo close the transaction for the land in Ramaṇa-reti, Prabhupāda and Mr. S. met at the Magistrate’s Court in Mathurā. In the presence of lawyers they completed the formalities. Prabhupāda saw it as Kṛṣṇa’s grace that he had acquired a good plot of land in Vṛndāvana, and writing to his G.B.C. secretaries in America, he asked them to send as many men as possible to help in the new project. He described his intentions “for raising up a very excellent center, to revive the spiritual life for Vrndavana on behalf of Rupa and Jiva Goswamis.”\nPrabhupāda told Kṣīrodakaśāyī, “I want on this occasion hugeprasādamshould be prepared, and every man in Vṛndāvana should be invited and takeprasādam.” Two days later, with a hundred people attending, Prabhupāda held the cornerstone-laying ceremony at Ramaṇa-reti. Again he descended into the ceremonial pit and placed the Deity of Ananta, on whose head the temple would rest.\nBut late that night the land was attacked. An elderly Indian widow, with local fame as asādhu,became angry that Mr. S. had not given her the land, which she had several times requested. During the night she sentguṇḍāsto dismantle the brick foundation of the ceremonial cornerstone and to desecrate the pit, which had just that day been filled with flowers and religious objects. Theguṇḍāsdug open the hole, threw garbage into it, and stole the “Posted” sign announcing the land’s new ownership.\nPrabhupāda was in his room at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple when he heard what had happened. He became angry and told his disciples to show the deed to the police. That night several policemen guarded the land, and when the hiredguṇḍāscame again, the police accosted them and warned that if they caused any more trouble they would be arrested. And that was the end of that.\nPrabhupāda had several times said that by becoming a devotee, one gains many enemies. The incident also served to confirm Prabhupāda’s conviction that ISKCON’s taking possession of the land should be followed as quickly as possible by construction of a temple. They should at least encircle the land with a fence, build small huts, and live on the land while preparing for temple construction.\nTejās:“This will be the Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple,” Prabhupāda said. We didn’t really know what was going on. We all thought it was so far away. It was really the boondocks, Ramaṇa-reti. Nobody was out there. It was such an isolated place, and there were lots of dacoits living out there. We thought, “If we’re going to have a temple out here, no one will ever come.” But Prabhupāda said, “Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, everyone will come.”\nPrabhupāda’s secretary, Śyāmasundara, wrote to a Godbrother about the newly acquired Vṛndāvana property.\nIn the month while Prabhupāda was away from Bombay (he had left on February 10) the payment of fifty thousand rupees was duly made. Slowly at first, a few devotees moved to the Juhu land, living in a tent. At night the rats and mosquitoes would disturb the devotees’ sleep. While attempting to clear the overgrown weeds, they came upon empty liquor bottles and overflowing sewage. Without Prabhupāda present, their resolution grew weak.\nBut then Brahmānanda Swami returned from Calcutta, where he had been with Śrīla Prabhupāda. Brahmānanda Swami was inspired, and he gave the Bombay devotees new impetus. They would have to clear the land and raise apaṇḍālright away. Brahmānanda Swami had never put on apaṇḍālprogram before, but he hired a contractor to build severalchaṭāī(palm frond) houses for the devotees and a festival tent. Even before the construction could begin, however, the devotees would have to thoroughly clear the land.\nMr. Sethi, a neighbor and life member, hired a work crew to cut down the weeds and vegetation, and several life members and friends in Bombay also came forward to assist. Mr. N. offered to help by sending one of his assistants, Mr. Matar, to organize the hired laborers in clearing the fields. The devotees also worked in preparation for Prabhupāda’s return.\nŚrī Śrī Rādhā-Rāsavihārī arrived at Hare Krishna Land in a taxi, riding across the laps of several devotees. They had moved before, and this time Their residence was a tent. They had first come to be with the devotees of Bombay during thepaṇḍālprogram at Cross Maidan in downtown Bombay. On that occasion there had been a procession to Chowpatti Beach, and when the devotees had arrived, Rādhā-Rāsavihārī, beautifully dressed and decorated and installed in an ornate palanquin, had been awaiting them. Kṛṣṇa was white marble and held a silver flute; Rādhārāṇī’s right hand, palm forward, extended a benediction. They were beautiful.\nAfter Their first appearance at Chowpatti, Rādhā-Rāsavihārī had moved to the Akash Ganga Building, where gradually the devotees had established a decent standard of Deity worship. When Prabhupāda had left orders that Rādhā-Rāsavihārī should move to Juhu as soon as the down payment was made, some of the devotees had questioned him: Why should the Deity move before the facilities were proper? Shouldn’t they wait until the temple was built?\n“Once the Deity is installed on a piece of property,” Prabhupāda had replied, “no one will remove Them.”\nMore than anyone else, Prabhupāda was aware of the proper worship to be offered to Rādhā-Rāsavihārī, but his emphasis now was on securing the land. How else, he reasoned, could he eventually give Rādhā-Rāsavihārī a royal throne and temple unless They Themselves first established Their right of proprietorship by taking up residence at Hare Krishna Land? The arrival of Rādhā-Rāsavihārī at Juhu also meant increased difficulties for the devotees, who now had to struggle to maintain the morningpūjāand cook six daily offerings in the meager kitchen. Even Rādhā-Rāsavihārī’s tent was insubstantial and swayed in the wind.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda, however, saw the move as a necessary, transcendental tactic. He felt certain that everyone involved – himself, the owners of the land, the Bombay municipality – would accept that the land belonged to Kṛṣṇa, since Kṛṣṇa was already residing there. And because he was asking Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself to accept these inconveniences, he prayed to the Deity, “My dear Sir, please remain here, and I shall build a beautiful temple for You.”\nBy the time Prabhupāda returned to Bombay, Rādhā-Rāsavihārī were installed on the stage of the festivalpaṇḍāl.Attendance at the festival was not as great as it would have been in downtown Bombay – no more than five hundred people came a night – but Prabhupāda was satisfied. This festival was on their own property, and this was only the beginning.\nEvery evening Prabhupāda lectured at thepaṇḍāland attended thekīrtanaandāratibefore Rādhā-Rāsavihārī. Pañcadraviḍa Swami had collected donations of five tons ofdāl,rice, and flour, and the devotees were regularly cooking enoughkicharīto serve 125 people freeprasādamdaily. In the evening Prabhupāda himself would give outhalavāfrom the Deities’ plate, and the crowd, including well-to-do businessmen and their wives, would press forward to receive theprasādam.Prabhupāda liked the festival so much that he told the devotees to arrange to keep the tent for a perpetual festival.\nPrabhupāda lived on the land in a tent, just like the other devotees, until a Mr. Acharya, one of the more favorable tenants living in the back of the property, invited him to stay at his home.\nWithin a few days of his arrival at Juhu, Prabhupāda was ready to hold the ground-breaking and cornerstone-laying ceremony – another tactic for securing possession of the land. But it was more than a tactic, as he wanted a temple constructed as soon as possible. Rādhā-Rāsavihārī should not remain standing in a tent but should be protected by a silver and teakwoodsiṁhāsanaon a marble altar. They should be surrounded by deities of the twogopīsLalitā and Viśākhā, and Their temple should have marble domes more than a hundred feet high. Thousands should come daily fordarśanaandprasādam.\nOne morning, in the midst of the festival activities, the devotees of Hare Krishna Land joined Prabhupāda in a simple cornerstone-laying ceremony. They had dug a deep ceremonial pit and surrounded it with bricks. Prabhupāda descended and placed the Deity of Śeṣa. Then, sitting on a simple platform, Prabhupāda accompanied thekīrtanaby playing a brass gong, while one by one the devotees came before him and threw dirt into the pit, filling it, while smoke rose from the sacrificial fire.\n“As soon as they see us,” Prabhupāda said later, “they say, ‘These Americans, they have got money!’ Our work is going on in India, but as soon as money is being spent, fifty percent is being spoiled because you Americans are inexperienced. What can be done? The Indians want your money, and they cheat like anything.”\nDuring thepaṇḍālfestival the tenement neighbors had become disturbed bykīrtanasover the loudspeaker. They were already disturbed that their landlord, Mr. N., was slow to repair the buildings and would sometimes let them go a full week without water before fixing the plumbing. Being suddenly forced to live with more than twenty American devotees only exacerbated their dissatisfaction. Some of the neighbors were converted Christians and unsympathetic to Vaiṣṇavism; they even feared their children might again be converted to Hinduism. Some tenants claimed the devotees were infringing on their privacy, some criticized the devotees for arguing among themselves, and others criticized that the unmarried men and women were living in close proximity – even though in separate quarters.\nA few of the neighbors, however, could see that the Western Vaiṣṇavas were struggling to sincerely worship Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. None of the tenants criticized Prabhupāda, however, so when he was present, he was able to pacify them and resolve any disagreements. But Prabhupāda knew that after he left, the situation could easily become volatile.\nPrabhupāda was planning an extensive world tour, traveling eastward to Australia, Japan, Hawaii, the U.S., and perhaps Mexico and Europe. It might be as long as half a year before he would return to India, and he wanted things to progress smoothly in Bombay without him.\nAgain, Prabhupāda had to choose a new Bombay manager, and this time he chose Girirāja, a youngbrahmacārīand leading preacher in making ISKCON life members. Prabhupāda reasoned that since the essence of management was to collect donations and make life members, and since Girirāja was expert at that, then even though he was young and otherwise inexperienced, he had the most important qualifications. Prabhupāda had already found Girirāja to be simple and submissively dedicated to helping him develop Hare Krishna Land.\nGirirāja:Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “You will do, Girirāja?” So I said, “Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, whatever you say.” I wasn’t actually very happy about it, but I understood that one should be surrendered to the spiritual master, and whatever he said, one should do. So I accepted. Prabhupāda said that good management meant that whatever needs doing, you do it – that’s all. Later I went in to see Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he was sitting behind his desk. He said, “Now the full responsibility is on you.” I winced when he said that, because I wasn’t used to taking responsibility.\nDuring Prabhupāda’s stay in Bombay, Hans Kielman, a young architect from Holland, had come to hear the lectures and had become interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Prabhupāda convinced Hans to become a devotee and to help build the Hare Kṛṣṇa city in Bombay. Under Prabhupāda’s direction, Hans at once began to make architectural drawings for the buildings.\nHans:Prabhupāda said, “Now you listen carefully. Lord Kṛṣṇa has sent you here. You must design these temples for Him. You must do these very sincerely and not be afraid.” I was completely surrendered. That moment was really ecstasy for me. He had a pile of photographs on his desk, and he gave them to me and said, “Look at this.” I looked at the pictures, and they were photographs of the new Govindajī temple in Vṛndāvana. He said, “I want you to make a design like this.” So I asked him, “How big, Śrīla Prabhupāda?” He gave me a piece of typing paper and said I should draw on this paper. Then he gave me the photographs and a pencil and a ruler. He took me to the next room and told me to sit down at the table. Pradyumna was there with all his Sanskrit books, Śyāmasundara was there typing the letters, and suddenly I was in between, making the drawings.\nPrabhupāda said Girirāja and the others would have to collect sixty-four lakhs of rupees for the construction. The devotees had no idea how they would raise even a fraction of that amount, but Prabhupāda gave them some ideas. He talked to them about enlisting the support of influential men by using thebheṅt-nāmasystem, whereby a person purchases the use of a guest room for life. And there were other ways.\nBut the immediate step was to get the land. They had possession of the land, but before building they should have the deed. Since Mr. N. was already overdue in delivering the deed, Prabhupāda told Girirāja to press him to comply with the written agreement and deliver the deed at once.\nAt the airport the next day there was a joyful farewell, as Prabhupāda waited for his flight to Australia. Sitting in the VIP lounge surrounded by devotees, Prabhupāda watched Madhudviṣa Swami lead an ecstatickīrtana.“If you go on havingkīrtanaslike this,” Prabhupāda told the devotees, “our Bombay project will be successful.” When Prabhupāda saw Mrs. N. had come, he exclaimed, “Oh, Mrs. N., you are also here! You are becoming one of us.”\nPrabhupāda had the extraordinary ability to bring a spiritual vision into physical reality, to change a part of the material world into spiritual energy so that even a common man could perceive the spiritual reality. This was Prabhupāda’s constant effort. Often a transcendentalist hesitates to deal with the material world, fearing he may become spiritually weakened. The Vedic injunctions, therefore, warn the transcendentalist to avoid associating with money and materialistic persons. But Prabhupāda, following the principles taught by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, saw that everything material had the potential of being used in the service of Kṛṣṇa and thus of regaining its spiritual nature. Following this principle, an expert devotee, although apparently acting within the material sphere, could remain always in touch with the spiritual energy. For such a devotee, nothing was material.\nIn the Vedic scriptures the great devotee Nārada Muni, because of his ability to convert materialistic men into devotees, is referred to ascintāmaṇi,touchstone. Just ascintāmaṇiis said to convert iron into gold, so Nārada could transform a beastlike hunter into a pure Vaiṣṇava. And as Nārada is glorified in theVedasfor accomplishing such feats in bygone ages, so Śrīla Prabhupāda is a similarly potent touchstone in the present age. Again and again he showed by his straightforward application of Kṛṣṇa consciousness that he could change a materialist into a completely renounced, active devotee of the Lord. And now, after recruiting a number of devotees frommāyā’scamp, he wanted to engage them in transforming as much as possible of the material world into living spirit. By his transcendental, visionary words, he was attempting to convert stone and human energy into glorious, spiritual temples.\nWhile ambitious materialists sometimes criticize transcendentalists as unproductive, Prabhupāda, because of his constant activity, could never be so accused. Rather, people would criticize him as being a capitalist in the dress of asannyāsī. But such criticism never deterred Prabhupāda; he was carrying out the desires of the previousācāryas.He had written this conclusion in hisŚrīmad-Bhāgavatameven before coming to America in 1965.\nPrabhupāda wanted to convert significant portions of the material world into the spiritual world. In attempting to construct a spiritual city in Juhu, he realized he was launching a major attack againstmāyā.Within a few months so many complications and headaches had already disturbed his plans, and more would come; the battle was just beginning.\nSometimes Prabhupāda’s disciples found the work to be draining and stressful; they would become bewildered. They had come to spiritual life for bliss, not for anxiety. Prabhupāda’s presence and his constant encouragement helped them remain steadfast. He knew that once they tasted the nectar of selfless dedication to Kṛṣṇa, they would never accept anything lesser. He would encourage them, reminding them of the words of spiritual predecessors like Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, who had said, “Difficulties undertaken in the course of Your devotional service I will consider the greatest happiness.”"

        "content": "PRABHUPĀDA TRAVELED WITH three disciples: Śyāmasundara as his secretary, Pradyumna as his servant and Sanskrit editor, and Nanda-kumāra as his cook. The first stop was Singapore, where, without explanation, immigration authorities refused Prabhupāda entry into the country. Sympathetic Indians in Singapore had arranged for Prabhupāda to lecture and had even mailed hundreds of invitations, but Śrīla Prabhupāda, disappointed and feeling ill, had to continue the twelve-hour flight to Sydney.\nApril 1, 1972Prabhupāda planned to stay a few days in Sydney before going on to Melbourne. Although the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was young in Australia, Prabhupāda saw positive signs: devotees to initiate, TV and radio appearances, and an interested crowd at his morning lectures in the temple.\nThis was only his second visit to Australia. On his first visit, almost a year ago, he had installed the Deities Rādhā-Gopīnātha and had prayed to Them, “Now I am leaving You in the hands of themlecchas.I cannot take the responsibility. You please guide these boys and girls and give them the intelligence to worship You very nicely.” Now, on returning and seeing the Deities beautifully dressed and well cared for, he felt happy. After five busy days of preaching he flew on to Melbourne.\nUpananda:In Melbourne Prabhupāda spoke at the Town Hall, and all the Melbourne hippies came. There was a man there called the Wizard. He used to be a professor at the university, but he resigned his post so he could carry out his shenanigans. He was very intellectual. He was dressed in a black cape and leotard, and he got up as soon as Śrīla Prabhupāda asked for questions. He had a group of his own followers. First he spoke very respectfully. “Excuse me, Your Divine Grace. I’ve been listening to your lecture, but I have one thing I would like to say in this regard. I believe that I am God. I am the center of the universe. And I will prove sometime next year that I am the center of the universe.”\nPrabhupāda said, “That’s all right. Everybody is thinking like that. What makes you different?” Actually, the Wizard’s whole game was that he wanted to be different – his dress, everything. So Prabhupāda exposed this, exposed him as just another materialistic fool. Everybody started laughing and clapping.\nAucklandApril 14, 1972The devotees had just opened a temple in New Zealand a few weeks before Prabhupāda’s arrival. Prabhupāda stayed a couple of days and installed Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities.\nBhūrijana:Prabhupāda installed large marble Deities, but there was only one girl to take care of Them. Prabhupāda was insisting that the Deities should be installed anyway and that They should be taken care of properly. He demanded that They should have many sets of clothes immediately. So some devotees built a temporary wooden altar and put up a curtain for the Deities. The curtains fell down. Everything was going wrong. It was confusing, and everyone was upset.\nSo Śrīla Prabhupāda just took over. He said, “Put this here. Put that back up there. Do this. Do that.” He completely took command of the whole situation. The devotees put the curtains back, and Prabhupāda said, “Get rid of thisvyāsāsana.” And they took thevyāsāsanaout, because it was so big and the room was so small that there was no room for the people. Prabhupāda just put a mat on the floor and sat down on that.\nBhūrijana: We had taught the Indian children to sing the prayers to the spiritual master. So we had them sing for Prabhupāda. He looked at me, and he was really pleased. Then he said, “Your wife said there are no interested people, but you have so many students here.” I said, “You have so many students, Prabhupāda.”\nAt the end of the lecture Prabhupāda asked if there were any questions, and a little Indian boy raised his hand and asked, “Who started the forest fire?” The boy was thinking of a forest fire mentioned in theKṛṣṇabook in Kṛṣṇa’s pastime, but all he said was, “Who started the forest fire?” But Prabhupāda took the question in a different way – that this material world is like a blazing forest fire, just like the prayers to the spiritual master had described. So Prabhupāda said, “No one started the forest fire. It starts automatically – just like in the forest, by the rubbing of two bamboos a fire may start. But by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa we can get out of this forest fire of material life.”\nPrabhupāda said he knew “the pulse of his disciples.” Thus he had recently sensed a tendency in his leading managers to be too absorbed in management and not enough in preaching. He had been telling his secretary that G.B.C. men should not simply sit behind their desks and try to centralize power but should become detached, takesannyāsa,and travel and preach. With this in mind he had awarded thesannyāsaorder to two of his G.B.C. secretaries, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Sudāmā. Now he advised that they not give up their managerial burden but follow his example of preaching and managing their G.B.C. zones in a renounced spirit.\nŚyāmasundara:Prabhupāda’s hotel room had rice paper walls and was very cold. It was like coming back into the northern climate, but without central heating. One day I came to Prabhupāda’s room formaṅgala-āratiand I had a blanket wrapped around me. I said, “Are you cold, Prabhupāda?” I could see he didn’t like the cold, but he wasn’t going to let that stop him from serving Kṛṣṇa.\nNanda-kumāra:At the Sunday feast there were about thirty Japanese people, mostly young, and every single one brought Prabhupāda a flower, put it at his feet, and paid fulldaṇḍavats.They were so respectful. Prabhupāda said that it was a good sign that “these boys and girls are able to honor a saintly person.”\nBhūrijana: We had arranged a program in Kobe. Many Indians and Sindhis lived there. It was a long journey out of Tokyo. They put Prabhupāda on the third floor of the house, and there was no elevator. Prabhupāda just put his chin out and walked right up, even though it was a tremendous effort for him.\nThe engagement was arranged in such a poor way that on the same speaking program with Prabhupāda was a Māyāvādīsannyāsī.Prabhupāda wanted to speak first, so he spoke in English. There were quite a few Indians there – about a hundred. Prabhupāda explained very clearly and strongly that Kṛṣṇa is God.\nThen the othersannyāsībegan speaking in Hindi. Prabhupāda was just sitting there with his eyes closed, chantingjapa.Suddenly he looked at us and said, “Startkīrtanaimmediately.” So we got up in the middle of thesannyāsī’sspeaking and startedkīrtana.Prabhupāda left quickly after thekīrtana.\nWhen we got back to the room with Prabhupāda, he explained what had happened. He said, “First he was preaching nicely. And then he started explainingpañcopāsana,about the five different features of the Absolute. And then when he said that the Supreme is ultimately impersonal, I could not tolerate it.” Prabhupāda said, “I am like a lion when I am out and a lamb when I am home.”\nPrabhupāda had business in Tokyo with his printer, Dai Nippon. He was greatly pleased with the faith Dai Nippon Printing Company placed in him, giving him hundreds of thousands of dollars credit just on his word. One of the Dai Nippon executives even approached him submissively, inquiring about whether his son who had died a year and a half ago had gone to the Buddha.\nA young Japanese executive, who translated the older man’s questions and Prabhupāda’s answers, explained to Prabhupāda, “Since then he has been very religious.”\n“He was the eldest son?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“Twenty years. Youngest son.”\nThe two executives spoke briefly.\n“He is asking how he can be relieved from such sadness when his son has died.”\n“Oh, yes,” Prabhupāda said. “The point is that the success of everything depends on how Kṛṣṇa is satisfied. That I have explained.” He related the example of Sāndīpani Muni, the spiritual master of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Sāndīpani Muni’s son had died, and he requested his two students, “My dear boys, I lost my child very young. If You kindly bring him, then I will be very much pleased.” So Kṛṣṇa went to the planet of Yamarāja and brought his son back.\n“So you try to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, and you will be blessed. Your son will be blessed. You pray to Kṛṣṇa – wherever your son may be, he will be happy. You believe in reincarnation, next birth?”\nThe young man spoke to the elder executive in Japanese. The older man nodded.\nPrabhupāda continued, “Yes. So your son, he must have taken a body somewhere. So if you pray to Kṛṣṇa, your son will be happy. He will benefit.”\nHawaiiMay 6, 1972During Prabhupāda’s week-long stay in Honolulu, he installed the five Deities of the Pañca-tattva: Lord Caitanya, Lord Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Śrī Gadādhara, and Śrī Śrīvāsa. He also lectured onyogaat a localyoga-meditation center. During his morning walks on the beach, he spoke about the fallacies of Darwinism. Waikiki Beach, he commented, was not as beautiful as Juhu.\nNanda-kumāra:At that time all the devotees in Hawaii were wearing sleeveless T-shirts and bright colors, and they had really bigśikhāshanging down very long. Prabhupāda said, “Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavaśikhāis an inch and a half across – no bigger. Biggerśikhāsmeans anothersampradāya.And they have to be knotted.” So I told everyone that, and they came back all bright and shiny with saffron shirts and properśikhās.\nGovinda dāsī:Prabhupāda stayed at a big house on the Makapu side of Oahu, right on the ocean – a very pleasant place. In the morning Prabhupāda would walk on the beach, and when he would return from his walk, he would sit down on a wooden bench on a little rock patio. We would all sit around, and he would give a little morning lecture. Later he would walk around and around in his room, chanting.\nOne evening I went in while he was chanting, and he said, “Sixteen rounds finished today?” and I said, “Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I am on my sixteenth round now.” He said, “That is good.”\nPrabhupāda was also thinking a lot about his Bombay center, and he asked me to do an architectural rendering of his idea for the Bombay buildings. Fortunately, an architect friend drew it up very nicely, and Prabhupāda was pleased with it.\nPrabhupāda had received a letter from a French disciple, Mandakinī-devī dāsī, who was going to join a Russian boy in the Soviet Union. She was going there to marry him and assist him in propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When Prabhupāda read this letter, he smiled in ecstasy. The thought of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement increasing in Russia gave him great joy.\nThen he turned to Govinda dāsī and said, “Preach while you are young. When you are old, retire to Vṛndāvana and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, these centers in India are being built. But you cannot retire unless you have preached sufficiently. The mind will agitate. If you have preached, you can retire and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa – so preach as much as possible.”\nAlthough sometimes Prabhupāda could spend only a day or even only a moment with an individual devotee, that brief association would leave a permanent inspiration. The devotees would realize that although Prabhupāda had touched them and given them guidance in a way that made these the most important moments in their lives, Prabhupāda was also beyond the moment and the place that he shared with them and was contemplating deeper issues and praying to Kṛṣṇa with an intensity that they could not yet understand.\nTime and time again his thinking turned to Bombay, Vṛndāvana, and Māyāpur, but he did not talk much about the problems. Rather, the devotees and nondevotees in each place he visited got the full blessings of his attention. While lecturing onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,he was in full concentration, and when he spoke privately, cultivating a guest or guiding an individual disciple, he fully gave himself. That he took responsibility for many persons and worldwide matters and did it all so graciously, always appearing before his devotees each morning on a walk or in the temple as fresh as a morning-blooming lotus flower, was the expert nature of his devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. He was open and simple, with a motive so pure that anyone could see it, and yet he was also grave beyond anyone’s vision. He served Kṛṣṇa simply in each time and place, whether riding the hotel elevator with his two disciples in Hong Kong, or curiously noting the details of Japanese culture, or walking on the beach beneath a Hawaiian sky.\nLos AngelesMay 18, 1972Word had spread that Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted G.B.C. secretaries to get out from behind their desks and preach, and four American G.B.C. men, eager to becomesannyāsīs,were waiting when Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived in Los Angeles.\nSatsvarūpa:Prabhupāda said that because we were takingsannyāsain the prime of youth, we had ample opportunity to do much more than he. He said he had takensannyāsaat the fag end of life but that “a little is better than nothing.” Everyone laughed at the thought that we could do more than Prabhupāda. One by one we went to thevyāsāsana,and Prabhupāda gave us ourtridaṇḍasand said, “Now preach, preach, preach.”\nImmediately afterward, Prabhupāda had us up in his room. We asked him if there were any special instructions. He said there were two restrictions insannyāsalife. One was that when meeting a rich man and seeing his opulent wealth we must not think, “Oh, I have given up everything, but I wish I could enjoy these things.” And the other restriction was that when we see a beautiful woman we must not think, “I had a beautiful wife, and now this beautiful woman is here. I could enjoy her.” In other words, do not have any regrets about having takensannyāsa.\nJagadīśa:Prabhupāda had all the G.B.C. men come to Los Angeles, where some of them tooksannyāsa,and we discussed reapportioning preaching zones. We had one special meeting with Prabhupāda. All the G.B.C men were sitting there in the room, and Prabhupāda looked us all over. He said, “Are you all convinced?” We just sat there. Nobody said anything for about two minutes. It was one of the heaviest moments of my life – Prabhupāda challenging us: “Are you convinced? Are you sincere?”\nAs Prabhupāda spoke, his G.B.C. disciples listened intently. “As far as I am concerned,” he said, “I am convinced. Therefore I am pushing on. It is a fact. I am pushing on because it is fact, not fiction. That much I am personally convinced. Whenever someone says, ‘You believe,’ I say, ‘No, I do notbelieve.It isfact.’ So youmust spread your conviction by your literature, arguments, preaching, facing opposing elements. But are you convinced? If you are not convinced, then it is not good for me. The first thing is enthusiasm. Don’t be dead. You have to work more than me. Anyone who has life, he can preach.\n“So the local president and treasurer of the temple will manage. The G.B.C. can supervise that things are going on. But the first management is that each and every member is chanting sixteen rounds and following the regulations. Otherwise, that is our spiritual strength.\n“Now it is in your hands. That was my plan – to give it to the Americans. But you have to be spiritually strong. If superficially you want to be managers, it won’t be good. And simply touring is not required. By traveling you have to do something substantial to increase the society. At the time of Lenin, he had just a few men, and he took over the entire country. It is up to you to spread God consciousness. Don’t be stagnant. Go and preach. Your duty is to inform them, ‘My dear American brothers, you have so much wealth and pleasure. Use it for Kṛṣṇa. If not, it will be degradation.’ ”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda met with many U.S. ISKCON leaders in Los Angeles and saw the wide array of Kṛṣṇa conscious activities in his Western world headquarters. He heard a new recording of Kṛṣṇabhajanas,performed with guitars and other Western instruments, produced at the devotees’ own Golden Avatar studio, and he approved it, saying, “This is better than George Harrison.” He visited the art studio, where the devotees were painting illustrations for his books, and he made suggestions.\nAnaṅga-mañjarī:Prabhupāda was going around looking at all the different temple offices. In one office Karandhara was showing Prabhupāda a new computer. “Prabhupāda,” he said, “all we have to do is type the words Rūpa Gosvāmī, and then it will automatically write everything you have ever said or written about Rūpa Gosvāmī.” Prabhupāda had been looking at the computer without showing much interest. But when Karandhara said the name Rūpa Gosvāmī, Prabhupāda raised his eyebrows and said, “Oh? Yes, everything can be used in Kṛṣṇa’s service.”\nThen we walked out of that office and went to the telex machine. Prabhupāda sat before it in the chair, and everyone stood around him while Karandhara explained what the machine did. “It can write a message all the way to New York, and they can send a message back immediately, Śrīla Prabhupāda.” So Karandhara typed on the telex machine, “Hare Kṛṣṇa. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. Please respond.”\nThere was no answer, so he typed it out again, and again there was no answer. So he typed it out again, and this time he typed out, “All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. Śrīla Prabhupāda is sitting right next to the telex machine. Please respond.”\nAll of a sudden the machine started typing out a reply, and Prabhupāda was sitting there watching it. The type read, “Dear Śrīla Prabhupāda, please accept our most humble obeisances at your lotus feet. We will be very eager to see Your Divine Grace in three days in New York.” Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke out, “Jaya! Haribol!”The message from New York was signed by many devotees, and Prabhupāda just smiled and said, “This is very nice.”\nAt this time, distribution of Prabhupāda’s books by his disciples was taking on a new dimension in America, and Prabhupāda heard the latest reports. From the beginning of his preaching in the West he had stressed printing and distributing his books as the most important method of preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He said his spiritual master had told him to print and distribute books and that he was following “blindly.” Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had been pleased if a disciple distributed even only a few copies of his magazine.\nIn the beginning years of ISKCON Śrīla Prabhupāda had also been pleased when his disciples had distributed a few hundred copies ofBack to Godheadeach month. Gradually his will for increasing the distribution of transcendental literature had manifested through certain devotees. In Los Angeles in 1968, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had daily taken a largekīrtanaparty downtown. The party, in addition to chanting and dancing, had circulated among the crowd and distributedBack to Godheadmagazines, as many as a hundred in a single day. When Prabhupāda had heard these reports, he had felt encouraged and had asked for the devotees to increase.\nPrabhupāda saw book distribution not only as the best method of preaching but also as a fair means of income. In India thebrahmacārīsin the traditionalgurukulasystem would beg from door to door, but in the West such a practice would not be respected. “But every gentleman will give a quarter forBack to Godhead,”Prabhupāda had said.\nEven as Prabhupāda turned more toward India and his projects there, he continued to encourage his disciples, especially in the West, to distribute his books: “Please increase your program of distribution to the public as well as trying to place our books and magazines in the libraries. I am simply interested in the book distribution.”\nTo the devotees in New York he had written in 1971,\nTo the devotees in Australia he wrote,\nAnd to the devotees of Africa Prabhupāda wrote,\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that if there were ample books, then everything else in ISKCON would succeed.\nBack in 1968, when ten thousand copies ofTeachings of Lord Caitanyahad arrived at the temple in New York, Brahmānanda Swami had wondered how they would ever distribute so many hardbound books on the lofty philosophy of Lord Caitanya. But in 1970, with the publication of another book,Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,some of the devotees in San Francisco had begun to go door to door, person to person, and sell the books. And not only one or two books, but twenty, thirty, even forty a day. The enthusiasm had spread as devotees in other temples had begun to sell increasing numbers of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books. Next, the young men had begun traveling in vans, going out all day, day after day, to discover the greatest ecstasy of distributing Prabhupāda’s books.\nThen a competition had started. Keśava’s boasts that the devotees in San Francisco were the best had drawn challenges from the devotees in Los Angeles, New York, Denver, and Dallas. A “saṅkīrtanafever” had begun. And at the center was Śrīla Prabhupāda, assuring that unquestionably book distribution had the topmost priority of all his missionary activities.\nHṛdayānanda Goswami:When Prabhupāda came to Los Angeles in 1972, he started theBhāgavatamclass where everyone chanted the Sanskrit. One effect was that devotees became more grave, a little more civilized. Just at that time things were a little wild in America. Thesaṅkīrtanaparties were doing so many wild things, staying out all hours of the night, sleeping anywhere, eating anything. Previously the temples had been a little sedate, and actually, even a little dry, because the devotees weren’t giving out many books. And then, when thesaṅkīrtanagot a little heavy, it was almost like a rodeo consciousness, this wildsaṅkīrtana –like bronco busting. But Prabhupāda came and introduced the chanting of Sanskritmantrasword for word, and the devotees submitted to a more grave and formal program.\nOn the first of June Śrīla Prabhupāda left Los Angeles for Mexico City. He said he would return in a few weeks.\nPrabhupāda conducted an intensive three-day lecture campaign in Mexico City, speaking at the National University of Mexico, the Masonic Lodge, and the Theosophical Society, and appearing on a television show with some thirty million viewers. He also held initiations at the temple on two consecutive days. Mexico was similar to India, he said, with pious people and a tropical climate. Even when he walked early in the morning in Chapultepec Park, many people followed him back to the temple. They recognized him as a saint and wanted his benediction.\nCit-sukhānanda:On Sunday afternoon there were more than five hundred people in the temple room. After the lecture Śrīla Prabhupāda went back to his room alone, and there was a bigkīrtanawith five to six hundred people chanting, “JayaPrabhupāda!JayaPrabhupāda!JayaPrabhupāda! Prabhupāda! Prabhupāda! Prabhupāda!” They became very, very ecstatic, and it seemed like the temple walls were going to come down. I was in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, and he said, “What is this?Kīrtana? They are making so much noise.”\nI said, “They are chanting your name.” And I went down to see what was going on. And all the people were waiting to come into Prabhupāda’s room. It was like they wanted to charge up to Prabhupāda’s room to be able to see him. They kept yelling his name, “Prabhupāda! Prabhupāda!” So I came up to Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Prabhupāda, they want to see you.”\nAnd Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “Well, let them come.”\nSo I immediately arranged that people could come in. He had two doors in his room, and they were coming in through one door on the left side and leaving through the door on the right. One by one, in a line, they just filtered through like a great parade, coming and offering different words to Śrīla Prabhupāda. Most of the people were saying in Spanish, “Your Divine Grace, Your Holiness, please bless me. Give me your benediction.” Everyone was praying for his benediction. And as the people would come in, they would bow down. Everyone was extremely submissive, and there were many people with tears in their eyes to see the great saint Śrīla Prabhupāda. And they said to Śrīla Prabhupāda, “Please give me your blessings.”\nPrabhupāda asked me, “What are they saying?” And I said, “ ‘Give me one blessing, one benediction.’ ”\nSo he had his hand in his bead bag, and with his finger outside his bead bag he would point to them and say, “Hare Kṛṣṇa.” And they were all very happy.\nPrabhupāda also traveled to Cuernavaca, where he lectured out of doors at the city plaza before a crowd of thousands. The audience sat patiently and heard his words translated into Spanish.\nCit-sukhānanda:Just then we had turned out our first book,La Conciencia de Kṛṣṇa Es el Sistema Mas Elevado de Yoga [Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, the Topmost Yoga System],and Śrīla Prabhupāda, during his lecture at the plaza at Cuernavaca, saw Haihaya dāsa arrive with newly printed copies of this red book,La Conciencia de Kṛṣṇa Es el Sistema Mas Elevado de Yoga.ŚrīlaPrabhupāda looked at him and was very happy to see his book printed. He stopped his lecture and said, “Now you can all take one of these books and read them.” And the people actually came up to Śrīla Prabhupāda to get the books. We only brought about fifty copies, but all fifty copies Śrīla Prabhupāda sold personally. The people took the liberty to ask Śrīla Prabhupāda for an autographed book, and he autographed almost all fifty copies.\nAfter the plaza lecture there was a hotel lecture, and then Śrīla Prabhupāda was supposed to go to a devotee’s home in Cuernavaca to takeprasādamand rest. But Śrīla Prabhupāda decided he wanted to return to the temple in Mexico City. He got back around eightP.M.,so from eight in the morning until eight that night he had not taken a bite of food, only a little water. We offered him fruit and things, but he didn’t want anything.\nWhen he returned to his room, his eyes were shining and his smile was broad, and he said, “This is the way to be happy. Work all day for Kṛṣṇa.” All he wanted was a cup of hot milk withpurīsand a cup of sugar. He pressed thepurīsinto the sugar, and he drank the milk with great joy and happiness. He said, “This is our life, to serve Kṛṣṇa. Work all day for Kṛṣṇa and take a littleprasādamat night.”\nOn returning to Los Angeles, Prabhupāda was again the center of the burgeoning Kṛṣṇa conscious activities there. But again his thoughts turned to Bombay, and he telegrammed Girirāja, instructing him to settle the conveyance immediately.\nGirirāja, after receiving Prabhupāda’s cable, went to Mr. N., only to learn of a further complication. After Prabhupāda had signed the sales agreement, the Indian government had passed a law obliging Mr. N. to pay a five-lakh gains tax upon executing the conveyance. Mr. N. didn’t have five lakhs at present and told Girirāja that ISKCON should pay it, and he would apply it toward the mortgage. But Bombay ISKCON didn’t have five lakhs either, so Mr. N. suggested Girirāja take a bank loan or secure funds from ISKCON temples in the U.S. He promised that in the meantime he would not sell the land to anyone else.\nGirirāja tried to get a loan from the bank, but he had no security or credit. He turned to some of the life members for help, to see if they could act as guarantors for a loan. But although sympathetic, they could not help him raise the money.\nGirirāja also began to doubt Mr. N.’s word. Although naive about legal matters, Girirāja was becoming suspicious of Mr. N.’s character and of his dealings. Talking with life members, Girirāja learned that actually Mr. N. was notorious for illegal business tactics. When previously Mr. N. had signed an agreement with C. Company for the very same land he was now selling to Prabhupāda, the sales agreement had eventually been canceled because C. Company had not gotten permission from the municipality for subdividing plots of land – and one of the conditions of Mr. N.’s sale of the land had been that C. Company get government permission to use the land. According to some of the businessmen with whom Girirāja spoke, Mr. N., through his political connections, had influenced the government against the C. Company.\nMr. N. hadseemedvery helpful, giving the devotees a good price for the land, and even providing workers for clearing it. And Mrs. N. had often attended Prabhupāda’s classes. But there also seemed to be many contradictions in Mr. N.’s behavior.\nHearing of these problems by mail, Prabhupāda considered them manageable. If a government tax had been imposed, then the devotees should deal with that and also continue trying for a loan. Certainly Mr. N. was tricky, but Prabhupāda felt ISKCON’s position was strong. Girirāja should persist, without becoming confused by Mr. N. Prabhupāda advised Girirāja to approach Mrs. Sumati Morarji and other supporters for financial help.\nPortland, OregonJune 8, 1972From Los Angeles Prabhupāda went briefly to Portland, where fifty of his disciples from San Francisco, Seattle, and Vancouver, as well as Portland, had congregated to meet him. From Portland he rode by car to Eugene, where he lectured at a large hall before an audience of mostly hippies.\nEvery temple in the U.S. wanted Śrīla Prabhupāda, and although Prabhupāda could not visit them all, he remained open to brief visits and public lectures in faraway places. He would sometimes confide to his traveling secretary that his disciples should do this preaching. But then another lecture opportunity would arise, promoted by an enthusiastic group of devotees, and Prabhupāda would surprise everyone by agreeing to go.\nJuly 20From England Prabhupāda went to Paris, where he lectured and performed an outdoor initiation ceremony at the Luxembourg Gardens. Hundreds of people, most of them student radicals from the nearby university, gathered to watch. Śrīla Prabhupāda began his talk, saying, “You French people have a history of being revolutionary, because you are looking for a better way of life.” When the words were translated into French, the students cheered and applauded. Śrīla Prabhupāda continued, “Therefore, you should inquire into this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is a revolutionary movement for reviving our original God consciousness.” About thirty devotees from Germany had come to Paris, and most of them, along with many devotees from England, Amsterdam, and Paris, received initiation that day at Luxembourg Gardens. In Paris Prabhupāda also attended a successful four-day indoor festival, where he was pleased to lecture and leadkīrtanaseach night.\nJuly 26In Amsterdam Prabhupāda installed deities of Lord Jagannātha, Lord Balarāma, and Subhadrā and lectured at Vondelpark before thousands of hippies. One day at Vondelpark a devotee was addressing the crowd when Prabhupāda suddenly told his disciples to stop. “These people are useless,” he said. “Just holdkīrtana.”\nLater he wrote to a disciple in the West,\nJuly 29At Edinburgh Prabhupāda was greeted by almost a dozen reporters from various newspapers in Scotland.\nKiśora:Edinburgh is a stuffy, puffed-up, tradition-steeped place, but Prabhupāda was very cordial and humble with the reporters. He was giving them so much credit about how nice the country was and how nice Edinburgh was – what nice buildings we have here – and he was saying, “You have two colleges here?” “Yes, yes, we have two.” Very proud they were. “So you have many students here?” “Yes, yes.” “It’s a very affluent city, Edinburgh?” “Yes, oh, yes, very rich and opulent.” And then Prabhupāda said, “So you have so many students, and you have so many nice big, big buildings. You have so much facility for enjoyment.” And they were agreeing: “Yes, yes, we have all this.” And Prabhupāda just looked at them straight and said, “Then why are your universities producing hippies?”\nThey looked at one another, and no one could answer. And Prabhupāda began to explain how society cannot bring happiness or contentment simply with buildings. “Stones and windows,” he said. “Where is the happiness there?”\nIn Glasgow Prabhupāda lectured at Woodside Hall before an audience of almost one thousand.\nKiśora:Prabhupāda was sitting onstage on hisvyāsāsana.The crowd was very large, and even the balcony was overflowing. When Prabhupāda arrived, the students greeted him like a pop star. They were cheering and whistling. Prabhupāda immediately began lecturing very heavily on the basic science ofBhagavad-gītā–how Arjuna became a successful devotee by killing all his friends and relatives. At the end of the lecture, I was a little apprehensive as to whether the people would accept that heavy lecture or not. But they cheered and applauded.\nWhen it came to question-and-answer time, one man came all the way down the aisle from the back of the hall and stood at the foot of the stage and looked up at Prabhupāda. For several moments he spoke, on and on and on, talking very proudly – “I am this. I am that” – and then concluding, “I am God.” That was the conclusion of his little monologue. The whole crowd was hushed, and I thought, “What’s going to happen now?” Prabhupāda simply looked down and let the silence continue for a few moments more. Then Prabhupāda spoke. “So, you are God – you have nothing more to say? You are not God – you are dog.” And immediately the crowd stood up and applauded and cheered. The man just looked at Prabhupāda, and a smile came on his face. With just those few words he had been defeated. He simply walked all the way back again to the back of the hall and was finished. It was ecstatic, because the crowd was participating in the whole thing. They all realized that God is not cheap.\nThen we hadkīrtana,and everyone in the audience was dancing. At that time they had gotten a bit lax at the door, and the local street urchins from this low-class area of Glasgow came into the hall, and they all began dancing and singing. Some of them tried to get up on the stage. Prabhupāda was also chanting, and so these kids were all trying to get around him and get on the stage to chant. The devotees started to push these dirty little children off the stage, but Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “Don’t do that. These children are all devotees. Let them chant.”\nWhen Prabhupāda finally got up to leave again, he reminded me of some big celebrity. He was smiling and waving and walking off the stage, and the audience were all shouting, “No, no, no!” They began chanting, “More, more, more, more!”\nAugust 1When Prabhupāda returned to London and heard that Sumati Morarji was arriving there, he went with a group of his disciples to meet her at the airport. He talked with her about his plans for Hare Krishna Land at Juhu and of his desire to form a board of trustees consisting of ISKCON’s Bombay life members. Sumati Morarji agreed to be president of the board, which would meet regularly and give advice for managing ISKCON’s Bombay project. Each trustee would also contribute a large sum of money toward developing a particular area of the project. Prabhupāda asked Mrs. Morarji to donate for the temple. He would request Mr. Khandelwal to donate for the library and Mr. N. for the two other wings.\nThat Mr. N. had not yet produced the deed, however, continued to weigh heavily on Prabhupāda’s mind, and he questioned Mr. N.’s intentions and Girirāja’s competence. If the only obstacle was the five-lakh tax, then Prabhupāda had already instructed Girirāja to approach ISKCON’s wealthy friends and secure a loan. What was the difficulty? But Girirāja’s communications sounded as if such a solution was “impossible.” On August 27 Prabhupāda telegrammed Girirāja: “HAS CONVEYANCE DEED BEEN SIGNED IF NOT FINISH IMMEDIATELY AND WIRE DETAILS.”\nAgain Girirāja went to Mr. N., although anticipating Mr. N.’s reply. This time, however, Mr. N. added yet another complication, reminding Girirāja that ISKCON had not yet obtained permission from the charity commissioner. ISKCON was a public charitable trust and so required permission from the charity commissioner before acquiring property. Mr. N. put the burden back onto ISKCON.\nAt the charity commissioner’s office, Girirāja learned that he should have applied for permission six months prior to signing the agreement for the land. To Girirāja and the other devotees in Bombay, the affair had become a huge Gordian knot.\nNew Vrindaban, West VirginiaAugust 30, 1972Only two days remained until the Janmāṣṭamī celebration, and more than three hundred disciples had gathered to be with Śrīla Prabhupāda. Janmāṣṭamī, Kṛṣṇa’s appearance day, is always followed immediately by Śrīla Prabhupāda’s appearance day, and this year, with so many devotees gathered in a holy place with Prabhupāda, the occasion promised to be especially auspicious.\nPrabhupāda had agreed to lecture every evening in an outdoor pavilion, constructed for the occasion atop one of New Vrindaban’s many hills. The lecture series was titled “Bhāgavata Dharma Discourses,” and through these meetings Prabhupāda set an example for his disciples that they hold similar festivals in other parts of the country. Throughbhāgavata-dharmadiscourses and book distribution, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement would increase its purifying influence throughout the world.\nPrabhupāda lived during these days in a small wood-frame house in the New Vrindaban woods. He regularly received visitors and lectured in the evening. Each evening, before his lecture at the pavilion, the devotees would hold akīrtanaand carry Prabhupāda up the long, steep hill on a palanquin. And afterward, as they carried him back down, he would be surrounded by chanting disciples bearing lanterns and torches.\nSureśvara:The path from the pavilion wound down and around on its way to the temple. I got there at dusk and beheld Śrīla Prabhupāda floating jubilantly in his palanquin atop a sea of devotees. There were hundreds of devotees, with tumultuouskīrtanaand roaring, plus dust was being kicked up everywhere from all the people. It looked spectacular, like a panoramic scene from one of those epic movies,The Ten CommandmentsorExodus,only much more, because it was transcendental. I just fell down in the dust as Prabhupāda’s palanquin came gliding past. It was very wild, but devotional.\nBaṭu Gopāla:It was a small palanquin carried by four men. There were some ropes for Prabhupāda to hold on to, and it wasn’t a very comfortable ride for him. But it was an amazing scene. Devotees with torches – electric torches and fire torches and lanterns – and Prabhupāda coming down in his palanquin, down the trail. Hundreds of devotees were surrounding him.Kīrtanawas roaring. I kept trying to get up close to Prabhupāda and get a glance.\nJāhnavā-devī dāsī:We were running down the steep hill in the dark amid the loud chanting of a river of devotees. And our feet seemed to never touch the ground. About halfway down, I caught up to the palanquin. But then I realized that being close to Śrīla Prabhupāda meant far more than physical proximity and that I needed to become much more serious about Kṛṣṇa consciousness in order to feel less distant from him.\nOn Janmāṣṭamī night Prabhupāda went to the temple and listened to readings fromKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godheadabout Lord Kṛṣṇa’s birth. Around two A.M. he noticed many devotees were nodding. “You are getting tired,” he said, smiling, and he ended the program.\nPrabhupāda had a copy of the purchase agreement with him, and he studied it carefully. Again he concluded that his position was strong, since he was occupying the land according to the terms of the agreement. He had paid two lakhs as promised, but Mr. N. had not turned over the deed. Now more money was being demanded, and Prabhupāda had said Girirāja should pay this money and get the deed. As for the permission from the government charity commissioner, there was no mention of it in the agreement. Although Mr. N.’s tactics were apparently bewildering Girirāja, Prabhupāda saw them as only empty bluffs. He telegrammed Girirāja, “TAKE BANK MORTGAGE PAY OFF N.” Before receiving any reply from Girirāja, Prabhupāda sent another telegram: “WHY DO YOU SAY CONVEYANCE IMPOSSIBLE EVERYTHING CLEAR IN AGREEMENT OF PURCHASE CONVEYANCE TO BE EXECUTED IMMEDIATELY ACCORDING TO TERMS OF AGREEMENT OF PURCHASE.”\nPrabhupāda spoke, explaining how, although an observer might misunderstand the devotees’ worship of their spiritual master, no one should think that the spiritual master was presenting himself as God. Prabhupāda compared the spiritual master to a tax collector. As the tax collector collects money only on behalf of the king, so the spiritual master receives honor, but on behalf of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Everyone should serve and bow down to the Supreme Lord, and the spiritual master comes and “collects” obeisances and worship on behalf of God, who accepts any sincere worship of the spiritual master as an offering to Himself.\nPrabhupāda ended his lecture, and a great feast climaxed the day and a half of fasting. Prabhupāda then returned to the back yard of his little house, where he talked with some of the devotees.\nHṛdayānanda Goswami:Prabhupāda was taking his massage, sitting on a straw mat outside his cabin. Suddenly, two little kittens appeared by his mat. And they were rolling around, tumbling. They were wrestling, tumbling, rolling around and around. Immediately I thought, “Oh! They are contaminated. I have to get them away.” The cats actually tumbled right onto Prabhupāda’s mat. They rolled in a little furry ball right over to Prabhupāda’s feet. Prabhupāda began tickling them under their chins. He was laughing, rubbing under their chins. Then he turned to me, sort of in a very jolly mood, and said, “Just see, even here there is love.”\nŚrutakīrti:I was in charge of the kitchen, so I was too busy to see Prabhupāda at all. He was there for a week, and practically the whole time I didn’t get to see him. I was so upset. I was doing all this service, and I had no opportunity to see Prabhupāda – always cooking until midnight. I felt so bad.\nSo the day before Prabhupāda left, Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja came up to me and said, “So you are going to be Prabhupāda’s servant.” I said, “Oh, no! This is wonderful! No, this is terrible!” I was so worried. Then he said, “You’ll be leaving tomorrow morning to go to Pittsburgh.” I thought, “Wow, that was quick! I didn’t know anything about it.”\nThe following morning Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja brought me over to the farmhouse Prabhupāda was staying at. He took me into Prabhupāda’s room and said, “This is Śrutakīrti. He is going to be your servant.” Prabhupāda looked, and I paid my obeisances. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja said, “He cooks very well, Prabhupāda.” And Prabhupāda said, “That’s very good.” “But he hasn’t massaged,” Mahārāja said. I had never done it before in my life. And then Prabhupāda said, “That’s all right. Anybody can massage. It is very easy.”\nSatya-nārāyaṇa:I was with a group of devotees. We would travel around the country in an old bus, preaching. On the bus we had Deities, a kitchen, and a shower. Prabhupāda was outside of his cabin when we drove up in the bus. When he came on, we received him just as in a regular temple, and we gave himcaraṇāmṛta.He looked at everything and said that there should be hundreds of buses like this. It wasn’t such a big event for him, but he really liked it.\nSatsvarūpa dāsa Goswami:Isaw different leading devotees go down to that house to see Śrīla Prabhupāda on important business. I had no important business that hadn’t been answered by him in letters, but I began to feel anxious that I was not going to him while others were. Finally, one day my anxiety grew so great that I decided I would go and see His Divine Grace.\nWhen I arrived at the door of the house, Prabhupāda’s servant gladly let me in, and in a moment I was seated before Śrīla Prabhupāda. He was seated to take his massage. I expressed to Śrīla Prabhupāda that I had no very urgent questions to ask him in particular, but that I had become anxious to see him, and so I had come. Prabhupāda replied that I should know better than to come to him out of such anxiety. He said he had already answered everything in his books. Actually, this was very inspiring. On the one hand, he was telling me that as an older devotee I should be assured that by studying his books everything was there. Not that out of anxiety I should feel a lacking and on an impulse have to personally see myguru.\nBut now, since I was in his presence, Śrīla Prabhupāda asked me, “What are you doing?” When Śrīla Prabhupāda said that, I got the strong impression that he was regarding me in the proper place, as a tiny fool. Here I had just been initiatedsannyāsa,and I was coming before Prabhupāda with my assistant and asking for his attention. Now that I had asked for his attention, he gave me a surveillance-glance, and by his question he seemed to imply that I was doing nothing or very, very little to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That was how I interpreted his question, “What are you doing?”\nI replied that I was, according to the instruction that I had received from him in a letter, going from temple to temple in my zone and implementing his desire that the students there study theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamin the morning class. I had previously felt very confident that I was exactly following direct orders I had been given in a letter from him. But to my surprise, in that room in New Vrindaban, he began to tell me that visiting temples was not the most important thing. He said that he was pleased with the program of Viṣṇujana Mahārāja, who was traveling on a bus. He said I should do like that.\nI immediately replied, “Then your instruction that I should go to the different temples is not very important? I should take a bus?” And Śrīla Prabhupāda became annoyed and said, “It is not that because one thing is more important the other thing is less important. Everything is important. Not that just because I say this is important, to travel in a bus, now you say traveling to the temples is not important. Kṛṣṇa’s head is important, and Kṛṣṇa’s foot is important. Everything about Him is important.”\nHe was setting the perfect example of a G.B.C. secretary. While conscientiously tending to practical affairs, he remained always transcendental – fully dependent on Kṛṣṇa and always preaching. After drafting a telegram to Girirāja or hearing of difficulties in Bombay, he would immediately return to his peaceful routine and active preaching. He would take his late-morning massage, bathe, put ontilakamethodically and delicately, say his Gāyatrīmantrawith silent composure, take hisprasādam,rest for an hour, and in the evening, after a full day’s activities, go into the temple room of whatever temple he happened to be in, sit on thevyāsāsanaand chantJaya Rādhā-Mādhava,and speak pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nSeptember 8After New Vrindaban Prabhupāda went to Pittsburgh, where he attended a successful engagement at a large hall, the Syria Mosque. He also met with a Catholic bishop, whom he asked, “Why do the Christians kill cows in slaughterhouses and thus break the commandment ‘Thou shalt not kill’?” Prabhupāda had often asked this question of Christian priests and was always unsatisfied with the answer. This was no exception.\nIn an informal gathering in his room, Prabhupāda stressed outgoing preaching programs, and he advised his newly initiatedsannyāsīspresent to follow the example of their Godbrother Viṣṇujana Swami: to travel in a bus from town to town and hold festivals and distribute books and magazines.\nSeptember 9The devotees in Dallas had purchased a large church facility and were forming the first ISKCON children’s school, known as Gurukula. Prabhupāda, while traveling in India during 1971 and 1972, had sent a series of letters to the Dallas teachers, explaining the basic direction he wanted them to take for beginning a Kṛṣṇa conscious primary school.\nThese letters had assured the Dallas devotees that they were doing the most important work for the pleasure of Śrīla Prabhupāda. The school had gained support from other ISKCON members, and many parents had sent their children. By the time of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s visit, about fifty students were enrolled.\nPrabhupāda said Dallas’s weather reminded him of Calcutta, even though he felt uncomfortably hot. Disdaining the use of air conditioning, he shed hiskurtāand sat on the lawn with his inexperienced but eager group of teachers. The best system of education, he said, was as he had known as a child: one teacher in a room with up to fifty students of various ages and aptitudes. One at a time the students would come to the teacher’s desk, receive guidance and a further assignment, and then return to work.\nThegurukulateachers were particularly concerned and puzzled about how to discipline children without being punitive, and Prabhupāda unhesitatingly solved all their puzzles. He said the students should both fear and love their teachers. The teacher, by stern countenance, may threaten an unruly child and make him submit, but the teacher should not hit the child.\nThe next day Śrīla Prabhupāda went into a classroom and sat on a cushion before the class. Holding a blackboard pointer in each hand, he joked that one stick could be used for hitting the students’ heads and the other for hitting their hands. The children and teachers became delighted to see Prabhupāda’s playful mood. And when he asked if anyone wanted to get hit, both teachers and students moved forward, holding their hands out for a merciful slap from Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nTo demonstrate how to teach, Prabhupāda called for a volunteer. Dvārakādhīśa came forward. Prabhupāda, placing his venerable hand over the boy’s, guided him repeatedly in forming the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet.\nNow Girirāja’s anxiety became Prabhupāda’s as again he concerned himself with all the affairs of his Juhu project. There seemed to be no one he could discuss this with, since the devotees in America knew almost nothing of matters in Bombay.\nThe night was too hot for sleeping, and Prabhupāda could not concentrate on translatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.So he stayed up late, talking with his secretary about Bombay. Surmising the mind and mood of Mr. N. and expressing his concern for his Hare Krishna Land and his wonder at the devotees’ hesitation and disheartenment, he turned the argument this way and that, considering it in different lights, until in the early morning he finally put it aside. Afterward, he composed another telegram: “SETTLE LAND IMMEDIATELY AT BEST PRICE POSSIBLE N. PROMISED TO PAY IT IF HE WONT WE CAN PAY SUGGEST 15000 DONT CHANGE PRESIDENCY UNTIL I COME.”\nJāhnavā-devī dāsī, however, unauthorizedly removed the original paint from the Deities and began to repaint Them. When Prabhupāda heard this, he became furious. He called the Dallas president, Satsvarūpa dāsa Goswami, to his room and demanded an explanation. Satsvarūpa said that he was a fool but that Jāhnavā had also acted without his permission.\nPrabhupāda then called for Jāhnavā and yelled at her furiously. She began to cry. “Why have you done this?” Śrīla Prabhupāda demanded.\n“Nonsense,” was her choked reply.\n“Nonsense,” Śrīla Prabhupāda affirmed, “suicidalnonsense! You are a nonsense, and you will always remain a nonsense. So, what are you going to do about this?”\n“Well, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Jāhnavā replied weakly, “I called up Baradrāja in Los Angeles, and he said if I use a certain kind of paint…”\n“Baradrāja!” Prabhupāda yelled. “Who is this Baradrāja! I am your spiritual master, and I am sitting before you. Why do you not ask me?” Disgusted, he then turned to the others in the room. “So, what is to be done about this?” One of the ladies said that with a quick-drying paint, they could repaint the Deities just as before in time for the installation. “Yes,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. “Do it immediately.”\nJāhnavā stayed up all night, carefully repainting the Deities as before. Early the next morning, which was to be the morning of the Deity installation, Kṛṣṇa looked very beautiful, although His body was tacky in spots from the fresh paint.\nDuring that morning’s walk around White Rock Lake, while talking philosophically about various topics, Prabhupāda turned casually to Satsvarūpa Mahārāja and asked about the preparations for the installation. When Satsvarūpa said he was uncertain whether Kṛṣṇa’s paint would be dry enough, Prabhupāda suddenly stopped. If the Deities weren’t ready, he said, there was no use in his staying any longer in Dallas. Turning to his secretary, he told him to change their flight reservations as soon as possible. Satsvarūpa begged forgiveness and said that maybe everything could still be done on schedule. Prabhupāda’s angry mood changed, and he continued walking, talking about other matters.\nLater in his room, Prabhupāda talked alone to Satsvarūpa, continuing on the point of his morning lecture about materialistic life. In a casual way, as most people would talk about ordinary things, Prabhupāda spoke of the foolishness of the conditioned souls. “They think that just by having a big family and being absorbed in mundane activities they do not have to concern themselves with death or with the next life.” As Prabhupāda spoke, he shook his head in disbelief, considering the incredulous position of the materialist.\nAll of Prabhupāda’s disciples noted the same amazing thing about him: wherever he went, his consciousness was always in transcendence. Whether staying up late worrying and talking about Bombay, or criticizing devotees for repainting the Deity, his mind was ever moving from one Kṛṣṇa conscious consideration to another. The devotees with him would sometimes observe his awesome Kṛṣṇa consciousness from a respectful distance. At other times they might, in the name of service, speak up and become more personally involved. Or they might find themselves thrust under the direct scrutiny of his demanding attention. No one could presume or accurately predict in what way Prabhupāda would act in his constant, grave service to his spiritual master.\nWhile sitting with Satsvarūpa Mahārāja, Prabhupāda began humming and singing a Sanskrit phrase from the morning’sBhāgavatamclass,gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām … .Then he asked, “So, how is the Deity?” Satsvarūpa said he thought He was dry.\nPrabhupāda stood and walked into the room where Jāhnavā was examining the repainted Deity. Calmly he stood before Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, singing to himself. “Yes,” he said, “now it’s all right.”\nLater that morning in the temple room, Prabhupāda sat on hisvyāsāsanaand installed Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, reciting the prayers from theBrahma-saṁhitā.He then offered the firstāratito the Deities, who had been hastily dressed and placed on an almost bare altar. Prabhupāda seemed pleased, however, and later went up to his room and wrote on a piece of paper, “Radha Kalachandji, the Deity of Dallas, September 12, 1972 – A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.”Kālacandajī,he said, meant “black moon.”\nPrabhupāda was preparing to return soon to India via a western route, and he paid another visit to his Western world headquarters in Los Angeles. On the very day he arrived, however, he wrote more directions to the devotees in Bombay, reassuring them the Juhu land was not just a trouble spot but a special place where a great plan would be carried out. It was worth fighting for.\nMail from Bombay always received first priority, and every morning Prabhupāda would ask for news from Bombay, giving any letter from Girirāja immediate attention. Early in October he received a long letter from Girirāja.\nNothing new had developed; the deed still had not been signed.\nAlthough Girirāja said he now had no intentions of resigning his post, Prabhupāda, after studying the letter, concluded that other senior devotees in India should also help. He therefore wrote to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami and Bhavānanda, both in Vṛndāvana, asking them to go immediately to Bombay and try to expedite the conveyance.\nPrabhupāda was asking Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami to revive his active status as a manager in India.\nPrabhupāda also wrote Girirāja, informing him that other devotees were coming to help and reminding him to also work with the board of trustees.\nPrabhupāda repeatedly instructed the managers in Bombay not to deviate from the terms of the purchase agreement. He was willing, as a matter of concession, to pay the five lakhs, to be deducted from the total price. But no more changes. The devotees should press Mr. N. to the original agreement.\nPrabhupāda was worried that he had not heard from his lawyer, Mr. D. Two weeks before, he had telegrammed both Mr. N. and Mr. D., asking for reports on the delays, but he had received no replies from either of them. He had since written to another lawyer, a friend in Bombay, asking about the delay, and in Los Angeles he received the reply: Mr. D. was no longer his attorney. A couple of days after receiving this shocking news, Prabhupāda received a formal letter from the office of Mr. D, informing him of the same.\nOf all the recent news from Bombay, this was the most disturbing. Prabhupāda began to see how Mr. N. had been devising a devious plot from the beginning. It was not just a matter of slowness or bureaucratic delay; Mr. D. had been in league with Mr. N. They were cheaters. So now it was going to be a real fight. ISKCON would have to go to court and file criminal charges against Mr. N. There was no avoiding the fight, but Prabhupāda still felt that his position was legally very strong.\nBefore leaving Los Angeles, Prabhupāda thought of a further tactic. He wrote to Girirāja that he should put a notice in the newspapers advising the public that ISKCON had signed an agreement for purchasing Mr. N.’s land at Juhu. He then traveled to Berkeley.\nOctober 6During his brief visit to Berkeley, Prabhupāda met with a group of professors from the University of California and also installed Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities in the Berkeley temple. But still he was meditating on Bombay. He wrote to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami,\nPrabhupāda decided to send Karandhara, whom he considered expert, to help in Bombay. He also wanted to send Śyāmasundara, but Śyāmasundara had gone to London regarding a large country estate George Harrison was donating. Prabhupāda notified Śyāmasundara, however, that once the London transaction was completed, he should go to Bombay. Prabhupāda was ready for the fight. He would not be cheated.\nIn Manila Prabhupāda carefully considered his position regarding the Juhu property and concluded that he would come out victorious. He listed the points of his argument in a letter to Girirāja."

        "content": "VṛndāvanaOctober 17, 1972\nPRABHUPĀDA HAD COME to Vṛndāvana to observe the Kārttika season (from October 16 to November 14). He planned to lecture daily at thesamādhiof Rūpa Gosvāmī in the courtyard of the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, speaking fromThe Nectar of Devotion,his own translation of Rūpa Gosvāmī’s book,Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.On his Western tour he had invited devotees to join him for Kārttika in Vṛndāvana, and now a few dozen devotees from America, Europe, India, and other parts of the world had gathered to be with him.\nHe was concerned with developing his Vṛndāvana project, so rather than immediately rushing to Bombay, he had come here first, sending some of his leading disciples to tackle the problems in Bombay. Now, like a general engaged on a different front, he awaited word from his lieutenants in Bombay. He moved into his two small rooms at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, while his disciples stayed nearby in the former palace of the Mahārāja of Bharatpur, an old building near the Yamunā.\nAlthough Prabhupāda was introducing his disciples to Vṛndāvana, he was also introducing the residents of Vṛndāvana to his disciples. Already his group was encountering some of the same attitudes Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī and his party of pilgrims had met in 1932: the people’s refusal to accept lowborn persons as Vaiṣṇavas. Prabhupāda trusted, however, that if his disciples could construct a wonderful temple for Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, the hearts of the Vṛndāvana residents would change, and they would accept his disciples. He tolerated the roughness and slowness of his disciples, and when Vṛndāvana residents came to see him, he humbly requested they also overlook his disciples’ faults and recognize them as genuine devotees of Kṛṣṇa; after all, they had given up sinful life and were regularly chanting the holy names of God.\nPrabhupāda lectured both morning and evening. Sitting on a simpleāsanaabout two feet high, a bare bulb suspended over his head, Prabhupāda would address his disciples and the few interested guests who sat before him.\nSome of the devotees had speculated that since they were now in Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda would probably talk on highly elevated spiritual topics, such as Kṛṣṇa’srasawith thegopīs.But it was not so. Rather, one of his disciples would read fromThe Nectar of Devotion,and Prabhupāda would interject extensive philosophical comments on attaining pure love of Kṛṣṇa through the successive stages ofbhakti-yoga.\nWhile Prabhupāda’s talks were especially for his disciples, he also stressed that thebrāhmaṇasof India accept the Western Vaiṣṇavas. And he cited dozens of scriptural references to prove his point that birth status, being a material designation, did not apply in spiritual life. Stressing preaching as the essence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he urged the disciples present to continue propagating the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nPrabhupāda’s disciples were thrilled by these talks and by Prabhupāda’s personal dealings with them in the intimate atmosphere of his rooms at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, which he referred to as his “eternal residence,” the place where he had actually begun his plans for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. His disciples could hear him rise early and begin translatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamand dictating his purports. Atāratitime, he would open the shutters of his room and behold the Deities. At other times the devotees might see him walking on the terrace chantingjapa.And they found him always available to answer their questions and help them with their personal problems.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, Śyāmasundara, and Karandhara arrived in Bombay. Things had worsened, Girirāja informed them. When Mr. N. had seen the notice in the newspaper publicly advising that ISKCON had entered into an agreement for the Juhu property, he had become furious. Girirāja had gone to him with folded hands and bowed down before him, but Mr. N. would not be appeased. He had gone back on all his promises and had canceled the sales agreement, on the plea that the devotees had not obtained the deed within a six-month period. The two-lakh down payment, he had claimed, was now his, and the devotees should vacate the land immediately.\nMr. N. had shut off the water supply to Hare Krishna Land. Several days later, a hoodlum had shown up at the entrance to the property, brandishing a machete whenever devotees passed by. A friend of Mr. N. had printed a handbill ascribing scandalous behavior to the American Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees and was having it distributed at the nearby Vile Parle train station. Although a few devotees had left and others wanted to, about thirty devotees still remained in Bombay.\nThe first thing to do, Karandhara said, was to find a new lawyer, and he went to Bombay’s most prominent solicitors and hired a specialist in land transactions and conveyances. Next, the leading devotees and their solicitor met with Mr. N. in his office. Mr. N. was stubborn and uncooperative, and the ISKCON lawyer was threatening. A court battle seemed inevitable.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, Karandhara, Bhavānanda, and Śyāmasundara talked together, and the more they talked, the more they began to see the entire Juhu scheme as impossible. Even without Mr. N.’s treachery, just to live on the land was very difficult. The devotees and the Deities had such poor living facilities that the roof leaked and the cement floor was crumbling. Rats, flies, cockroaches, village dogs, and mosquitoes infested the place – with even an occasional poisonous snake. Devotees were always contracting tropical diseases, especially malaria and hepatitis.\nSo although ISKCON’s new lawyer was prepared to take the case to court, the devotees were hesitant. Mr. N. had said that they – not he –  were criminals, because they had not gotten permission from the charity commissioner; they were on his land illegally. He said he would sue for damages. He even seemed to be on the verge of some violent action. Considering all angles, the leaders whom Prabhupāda had entrusted to solve the Juhu entanglement decided that ISKCON should relinquish the land. Drafting a joint letter to Śrīla Prabhupāda, they had Śyāmasundara hand-deliver it to him in Vṛndāvana.\nHe had Pradyumna read, stopping him to explain a point whenever he felt inclined. He spoke of the special benefits of residing in Vṛndāvana, but warned that one should not come to thedhāmato do business or to commit any offenses. If, however, a Vṛndāvana resident did commit an offense, he could still receive the special benefits – provided he remained “sticking to the dust of Vṛndāvana.”\nNight fell, and in the dark courtyard Prabhupāda continued lecturing beneath the dim electric bulbs. Visiting pilgrims came and went, watching “the Swamiji” lecturing in English to his Western disciples.\nAfter the question-and-answer period, Prabhupāda walked back to his room, exchanging words along the way with Gaurachand Goswami, the temple proprietor. Some devotees lingered in Prabhupāda’s room, and many Indians peered through the barred windows, although they had never cared to look years ago, before the room’s permanent resident, Bhaktivedanta Swami, had gone to America.\nWhen Prabhupāda was finally alone, he began to think of Bombay. Although hundreds of miles away, the occurrences there were beating on his heart here in Vṛndāvana. He took out his copy of the agreement he had signed with Mr. N. Then he called his secretary and began dictating a letter to his leaders in Bombay.\nHe began his letter like a lawyer, answering logically, point by point. One reason his disciples had given for wanting to give up the land was that the charity commissioner had refused them permission. In that case, Prabhupāda reasoned, they should try to get back the money and give up the land. But it appeared that the charity commissioner’s permissionwas delayed,not denied – a small matter. Although Mr. N. had mentioned a six-month time limit for obtaining the charity commissioner’s approval, Prabhupāda pointed out that the original agreement mentioned no such time limit.\nAnother reason Prabhupāda’s men had given for wanting to relinquish the land was that, according to Mr. N., they had failed to obtain the conveyance within six months, as per the original sales agreement. Prabhupāda replied that, according to the clause in question, “it isouroption to rescind the contract within six months, not the vendor’s.” But the real point was that Mr. N. had accepted checks worth one lakh rupees as down payment within the six-month period, and therefore the sales agreement was completed.\nIf Mr. N. was threatening violence, that also was not grounds for quitting the land. The devotees were on the land legally and should seek police protection.\nPrabhupāda’s conclusive advice was that the devotees go to the magistrate and tell him, “We gave Mr. N. money, and now he is threatening violence to drive us away.” They should not be afraid.\nEarly one morning Subala left the land at Ramaṇa-reti, where he had been staying, and approached Śrīla Prabhupāda on the roof of the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. “Prabhupāda,” he said, “I am having so much difficulty. I don’t have time to read, I can’t chant my rounds properly, I can’t think of Kṛṣṇa. I’m always thinking of how this contractor is cheating us, or I’m thinking of signing checks for labor and materials. It’s just too much. All these things on my mind are stopping me from thinking of Kṛṣṇa.”\n“Do you think Arjuna was simply meditating on Kṛṣṇa on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra?” Prabhupāda replied. “Do you think Arjuna was sitting in yogic trance, while on the battlefield Kṛṣṇa worked? No, he was fighting. He was killing for Kṛṣṇa. He was thinking of all the soldiers he had to kill for Kṛṣṇa.\n“Thinking of the checkbook, thinking of the men, thinking of the contractors – this is also like Arjuna’s thinking. This is Kṛṣṇa’s service. You should not worry about thinking of Kṛṣṇa directly. Arjuna wasn’t sitting before Kṛṣṇa in a trance, meditating on His form. He was engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service. Similarly this is Kṛṣṇa’s service, and you should engage. Your life is full of Kṛṣṇa’s service, and that is very good.”\nSubala was still unsatisfied. He complained to Prabhupāda that the other devotees wouldn’t cooperate with him. He wanted to go into seclusion in Vṛndāvana for the rest of his life and chant, instead of becoming a full-time preacher in ISKCON.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda asked, “What do you mean, no one will listen to you? You think that means they are defective? No,youare defective.” Prabhupāda raised his voice. “If you are preaching and no one will listen, don’t think you should go away in disgust and save yourself by chanting. No, that is not our line. We must qualify ourselves so they will listen. Do you know the story of Mr. Beecham?”\nSubala shook his head.\n“No one would buy his medicine,” Prabhupāda continued, “so he became anxious. Still he tried, and one day a man approached him in his shop and asked if he had any Beecham’s Powder, and in excitement that someone had asked for his medicine, he died. Similarly, better we spend our whole life and die just to make one person Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is our line, to become so absorbed in preaching Kṛṣṇa, whether in Vṛndāvana or anywhere. We must save all theseasurasfrom destroying the world.”\nIn stressing active service and practical results, Śrīla Prabhupāda was exactly following the teaching and example of his spiritual master. According to Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, to chant in a secluded place and not preach was “a cheating process.” Devotional service meant practical work for Kṛṣṇa. The simple, positive way to control the senses was to engage them fully in the service of Kṛṣṇa. Active service was the topmostyoga,Prabhupāda told Subala, a fact that he had repeatedly explained in his books. In the recently published Second Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,he had written,\nAs far as possible, Prabhupāda engaged each disciple in a certain service according to the particular disciple’s psychophysical nature. But everyone had to take up some kind of work for Kṛṣṇa. Since Prabhupāda desired to build a temple in Vṛndāvana, then whoever would help him do it, whether they were trained or not, or whether it was their tendency or not – whoever offered him assistance – would become very dear to him and to Lord Kṛṣṇa.\nWhen a householder couple, Gurudāsa and Yamunā, agreed to remain in Vṛndāvana to help Prabhupāda build the temple, Prabhupāda welcomed it and shared with them the intention of his plan.\nBy the time Prabhupāda and most of his disciples left Vṛndāvana at the end of Kārttika, relations between his disciples and the residents of Vṛndāvana had improved. The people of Vṛndāvana were impressed by the devotees’ dailysaṅkīrtanaprocession to Ramaṇa-reti, and they were impressed by Prabhupāda. Although Prabhupāda felt that much time had been wasted – it had been a year since Mr. S. had offered them the land – he was now hopeful.\nISKCON projects were developing all over the world, and all were struggling. The devotees’ only means of income was from the sale of books and, to some degree, from their Spiritual Sky incense business. As yet Prabhupāda had no architectural plan for his Vṛndāvana project, but he determined to gather from his Book Fund and from devotees enough money for materials and labor. One day he went to the building site and asked a devotee to mix a little cement, and with his own hand, he laid down the first concrete for the foundation.\nHyderabadNovember 11, 1972Prabhupāda had come to Hyderabad for apaṇḍālprogram. Big crowds attended his lectures, and wherever he went, even while getting into and out of his car, people surrounded him to touch his lotus feet. Although Hyderabad had been suffering from drought, a few days after Prabhupāda’s arrival rains came. One newspaper suggested that theharināma-kīrtanaŚrīla Prabhupāda and his devotees performed so enthusiastically must have ended the drought. Prabhupāda agreed.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda met with Mr. N., who was visiting Hyderabad from Bombay. Śyāmasundara still had a cordial relationship with Mr. N., because Mr. N. had been fond of his three-year-old daughter, Sarasvatī. So he went to Mr. N. and convinced him to speak to Prabhupāda. Mr. N. agreed, but being suspicious that Prabhupāda might try to use mystic power to persuade him to do something against his will, he brought aguruwith him, thinking theguruwould counteract Prabhupāda’s spiritual power.\nMr. N., hisguru,and Śyāmasundara all came to the home of Panilal Prithi, where Prabhupāda was staying. Prabhupāda met informally with his guests, conversing with them overprasādam,until he yawned, and Mr. N.’sgurusaid, “Oh, Swami, you must be very tired. We should not disturb you now. You should rest, and we may talk later.”\n“Oh, yes,” Prabhupāda replied, “I am very tired.”\nSo Mr. N. and hisguruexcused themselves and retired to the adjoining room.\nAfter a few minutes Prabhupāda called Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami into his room. “When someone asks you ifyouare tired,” Prabhupāda said, “it meansheis tired. If you go into the other room, you will see that they are sleeping.” He instructed Tamāla Kṛṣṇa to carefully awaken Mr. N. without disturbing hisguruand bring him in.\nTiptoeing into the room, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa found both Mr. N. and hisguruasleep on the beds. He went over to Mr. N., touched his arm, and said quietly, “Mr. N., Mr. N., wake up. Prabhupāda would like to speak with you. Come quickly.” Mr. N., being roused from his slumber, obediently walked into Prabhupāda’s room, forgetting hisgurufriend.\nFor two hours Prabhupāda talked with Mr. N., and by the end of the discussion they had worked out a new sales agreement. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Śyāmasundara, working in a separate room, drafted and typed the documents, while Prabhupāda and Mr. N. settled the final legal points. Then Mr. N. signed the agreement, while hisgurufriend continued sleeping soundly.\nLater that day Tamāla Kṛṣṇa confided to Śrīla Prabhupāda, “I am so disturbed by these dealings that I can’t chant my rounds properly.”\n“That is natural,” Prabhupāda replied. “Sometimes when I am disturbed, I also.”\n“But I can see that I am making spiritual advancement, even so,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa admitted.\nPrabhupāda nodded.\n“I used to think how to avoid difficult situations,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said. “But now I think I should not run away from them.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “we should welcome these. They give us an opportunity to advance more.”\nŚyāmasundara and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami flew back to Bombay with Mr. N. that afternoon. According to the new terms, ISKCON would pay Mr. N. the five lakhs of rupees for the government tax, and in return Mr. N. would execute the deed. But there was also a new time limit –  three weeks – and the devotees would have to work fast. Prabhupāda himself would soon come to Bombay to settle the matter once and for all.\nBombayNovember 25, 1972Although Prabhupāda had come to Bombay with hopes of finishing the land transaction, Mr. N. was still delaying, despite the new agreement. Obviously his stalling was simply part of his plan to cheat ISKCON. Śrīla Prabhupāda waited many days in Bombay, finally departing for apaṇḍālprogram in Ahmedabad. He left behind instructions for his disciples to get the deed on the new terms or else to take back the original two lakhs of rupees paid as the down payment.\nWhile Śrīla Prabhupāda was away, however, Śyāmasundara, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, and the others began talking about how even if they could one day get the deed to the Juhu property, to develop Hare Krishna Land the way Prabhupāda had envisioned would be practically impossible. Śyāmasundara argued that even if they got the land, how could they really expect to build a big temple and hotel out here in the jungle? It just wouldn’t work. Meanwhile, from Ahmedabad Prabhupāda continued to wage his Bombay campaign, and he requested Mr. N. and Mr. D. to come to Ahmedabad to try and make a settlement. They declined.\nIn Bombay the devotees learned that if they wanted to get back their down payment as well as the money they had deposited toward the five-lakh gains tax, then they would have to cancel the new agreement. They were confused, and their time was running out.\nOne morning one of Prabhupāda’s disciples, Viśākhā-devī dāsī, arrived in Ahmedabad from Bombay. Prabhupāda called for her and told her to return to Bombay immediately with a message. Out of concern that his leaders in Bombay not make a wrong decision and decide to relinquish the land, he told her to tell them that they should not under any circumstances cancel the agreement with Mr. N. “Actually,” he said, “this is not a woman’s job, but everyone else here is either engaged in thepaṇḍālor has not been with us long enough to do this task.”\nViśākhā took the next train out of Ahmedabad and arrived in Bombay the following morning. But what Prabhupāda had foreseen had already happened: the devotees had canceled the sales agreement. They were convinced that to get the land would be a mistake, and their lawyers had agreed, pointing out that if the devotees wanted to retrieve their money, they should cancel the agreement immediately. When the devotees heard Prabhupāda’s message from Ahmedabad, confusion reigned. They now had no legal standing, no claim to the land. And they had failed to carry out Prabhupāda’s desire! Girirāja phoned Prabhupāda in Ahmedabad to tell him what had happened.\n“Bhaktivedanta Swami here,” Prabhupāda said as he took the telephone. Girirāja was saying that a devotee had come from Ahmedabad with a message. “Yes, yes,” Prabhupāda said, “what is the point?” Finally Girirāja blurted out that they had canceled the sales agreement. Prabhupāda was silent. Then in a voice that expressed both anger and resignation, he said, “Then everything is finished.”\nMr. N. could not possibly understand why Prabhupāda was so determined in his fight to keep the Juhu land. Not that Prabhupāda had kept his motives hidden, but only a devotee can understand the mind or actions of another devotee. Mr. N. was dealing with Prabhupāda just as he had dealt with C. Company. He had cheated them, and now he would cheat ISKCON. He could only surmise that Prabhupāda and his disciples were driven by the same motive as he himself, the only motive he could understand: material possessiveness.\nActually, even Prabhupāda’s disciples were having difficulty understanding Prabhupāda’s unbreakable determination. Prabhupāda’s main motive was to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Bombay. Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “My Guru Mahārāja ordered me to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the West, and I have done that. Now I want to preach in India.” Bombay was the most important city in India – the gateway. And within Bombay, Kṛṣṇa had somehow led Prabhupāda to this land, where he had begun preaching and had brought the Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. In Prabhupāda’s eyes, the land was suitable for the large, gorgeous temple and international hotel he had planned.\nBombay was an important city and required grand temple worship, large festivals, massprasādamdistribution, and a variety of Vedic cultural programs. The Juhu land seemed ideal for a school, a theater, a library, apartments – a Hare Kṛṣṇa city. So how could Prabhupāda retreat from this rogue who was trying to cheat him? There would always be persons opposed to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Prabhupāda said, but that did not mean the devotees should give in. A preacher had to be tolerant, and sometimes, when all else failed and Kṛṣṇa’s interest was at stake, he had to fight.\nAnother reason Prabhupāda refused to give up this particular plot of land was that he had promised the Deities, Rādhā-Rāsavihārī. He had invited Kṛṣṇa here and prayed, “Dear Sir, please stay here, and I will build You a beautiful temple.” When Prabhupāda had been touring and a devotee from Bombay had written him that the Deities were being neglected, Prabhupāda had written back insisting that these “abominable activities” be rectified. The Deity of Kṛṣṇa was not a stone statue but was actually Kṛṣṇa, eager to reciprocate with His sincere devotee.\nSo if using the land for missionary work was the obvious or external reason for Prabhupāda’s determination to keep his Hare Krishna Land, then the internal reason was his personal commitment to Their Lordships Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Rāsavihārī. Certainly Mr. N. and his associates could never understand this. Even Prabhupāda’s own disciples could not realize it fully. Prabhupāda had brought Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa into very poor conditions, but with the promise of something wonderful to come. At his request Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa had come, and They were standing patiently, giving eternal benediction to Their worshipers, while Prabhupāda struggled to fulfill his promise.\nFive hundred years ago each of the six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana had had his own Deity, for whom he had built a beautiful temple. But Prabhupāda was empowered to install and maintain many Deities. In his Western world headquarters were the opulent Rukmiṇī-Dvārakādhīśa, in New York Rādhā-Govinda, in Dallas big Rādhā-Kālacandajī, on a traveling bus in America with Kīrtanānanda Swami and Viṣṇujana Swami were Rādhā-Dāmodara, in London Rādhā-London-īśvara, in Māyāpur Rādhā-Mādhava, and in Australia Rādhā-Gopīnātha. All were Prabhupāda’s worshipable Deities,arcā-vigrahaincarnations of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa appearing at the request of Their pure devotee for the benefit of neophyte devotees in various places around the world.\nTo establish many Deities was one of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s prime contributions as a world preacher. And when he would visit each temple, he would always stand reverently before the Deities, taking Their blessings, and then he would offer prostrated obeisances. “Be humble,” he would instruct the devotees. “Always remember you are dealing with Kṛṣṇa.” And sometimes he would be unable to suppress his ecstatic symptoms of love for the Deities. Through his representatives, his many disciples, he worshiped all these Deities, but in the case of Rādhā-Rāsavihārī his involvement was more direct. Having taken India as his own managerial duty, he considered caring for this Deity his specific responsibility.\nPrabhupāda’s fighting spirit to keep the land was so keen that he sometimes appeared to be fighting for fighting’s sake. He sometimes even compared Mr. N. to the demon Kaṁsa inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,who had repeatedly tried to kill Kṛṣṇa. Just as Kaṁsa had employed many minor demons in his attempts to kill Kṛṣṇa, so Mr. N. had employed demoniac agents like lawyers, friends, and hoodlums. Kṛṣṇa’s killing of demons like Kaṁsa was His pastime, orlīlā– He enjoyed it. And Prabhupāda, as the servant of Kṛṣṇa, was fully absorbed in this fighting. He was vigilant, militant. When Mr. N. bluffed or frightened the devotees, causing them to back down, Prabhupāda held his ground. He took naturally to the fight; Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s mission were being challenged.\nNever before had Prabhupāda been so threatened or met such active enemies. In New Delhi, when he had been selling hisBack to Godheadmagazines, he had often met with brusque words, and in America people had ignored him and occasionally heckled him. But no one had seriously attempted to stop his preaching. Here, however, was a demon working actively to cheat him, to destroy his preaching, to disperse his disciples, and to displace his deity. He was forced to fight, and his disciples, if they were to understand his mood, would also have to fight.\nPrabhupāda was acting as the protector and the parent of the Deities and of ISKCON Bombay. As he had described inThe Nectar of Devotion,many great devotees have an eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa as His protector. When as a child Kṛṣṇa had fought the serpent Kāliya, Kṛṣṇa’s mother and father had been plunged into transcendental anxiety. They had seen their child entangled in the coils of the serpent and, fearing for Kṛṣṇa’s life, had wanted to protect Him. The eternal mother and father of Kṛṣṇa always worry that Kṛṣṇa may meet with harm, and when danger appears to come, their natural anxiety increases many times. In this way they show the most intense love for Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mood was to protect Rādhā-Rāsavihārī and also his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Although he knew that Kṛṣṇa was the supreme protector and that nobody could oppose His will, out of a protective desire to spread Kṛṣṇa’s glories he feared that the demon Mr. N. might harm Kṛṣṇa.\nPrabhupāda’s feelings of anxiety and protectiveness extended to his disciples also. Although out of duty he often criticized and corrected them privately, before others he usually defended and praised them. When Dr. Patel, a Bombay physician, had criticized the way the devotees were living, not protecting themselves from mosquitoes, Prabhupāda had said that because his devotees were liberated and did not identify with their bodies, such things did not trouble them.\nPrabhupāda saw his disciples as children, with little worldly experience; they did not know how to deal with rogues and could be easily tricked. But if the son was gullible, the father would have to be shrewd and strong to protect his family. As protector of the devotees and of Kṛṣṇa’s mission, Prabhupāda wanted to establish good housing so that his disciples could serve Kṛṣṇa in comfort – even elegance. Prabhupāda’s spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, had taught the same thing when he said that preachers of Kṛṣṇa consciousness should have the best of everything, because they were doing the best service to Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda was therefore determined to establish his Hare Kṛṣṇa city in Bombay. He did not take the attitude of a naked mendicant, who cares for nothing of this material world. He felt responsible for his thousands of disciples, and therefore he took on so many anxieties.\nMr. N. could not know what motives were driving Śrīla Prabhupāda. Nor could he imagine the full ramifications of opposing Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s pure devotee, even though the danger of such a position had been explained in India’s most famous classics,Bhagavad-gītā,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,andRāmāyaṇa.Prabhupāda was fighting on the side of Kṛṣṇa; therefore, Mr. N. was opposing the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nImportant guests like Mr. R.K. Ganatra, the mayor of Bombay, made introductory speeches, and the devotees also took an active part, organizing, advertising, cooking and distributingprasādam,distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books, and preaching at a question-and-answer booth. Thepaṇḍālfestival served to lift the devotees out of the doldrums of their protracted legal fight and the austerity of their living at Juhu.\nDuring the last week of January 1973, Prabhupāda met with Mr. N. at the residence of Mr. Mahadevia. Although Prabhupāda’s lawyers had filed a criminal case against Mr. N., Prabhupāda wanted to attempt an out-of-court settlement. He had always been gracious and charming with Mr. N., and Mr. N. had always appeared responsive and polite. But this time was different. Gone were the smiles and friendly words. The two were remaining barely civil to each other. After a few minutes, Prabhupāda asked his disciples to leave the room.\nSpeaking in Hindi, Mr. N. began accusing Prabhupāda and the devotees of being connected with the CIA. “I will come on Monday,” said Mr. N. tersely, “with a check for two lakhs to pay back your down payment.”\n“All right,” Prabhupāda replied. “If you don’t want to part with your land, then we will leave. But think before you do this.”\nMr. N. continued his accusations. “You people are calling yourselves the owners of the land, but you are just a big disturbance to the whole area, getting up at four and all this…”\n“We do not claim to be the owner,” Prabhupāda replied. “Kṛṣṇa is the real owner. I am not the real owner. Kṛṣṇa is already there on His land. Why are you bothering us so much? Simply take the money and give us the land. Or, if you want us to vacate, then prepare the check.” Prabhupāda had been speaking with restraint, but now his tone became angry. “Bring out your check, and we will vacate tomorrow morning. No, we will vacate tonight! Give us our money back. Have you the money?”\nMr. N. shouted, “I will remove the Deities myself! I will break the temple and remove the Deities!” Mr. N. then stormed out of the room.\nThat week Mr. N. was hospitalized after a severe heart attack. Two weeks later he died. When Prabhupāda heard of Mr. N.’s death, he was at first silent. Then he quoted a verse Prahlāda Mahārāja had spoken following the death of his demoniac father, Hiraṇyakaśipu:modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā.“Even a saint is pleased when a snake or scorpion is killed.”\nPrabhupāda did not commit himself to construction on the land, because he had no deed and no assurance of one. He toured the West, returned to India, but still nothing had happened to resolve the matter. Life in ISKCON Bombay was peaceful, but progress remained stunted, the outcome uncertain.\nThen one day, without warning, Mrs. N. launched a violent attack. On the morning of June 1, while the devotees were attending their routine duties, a truck drove onto the Juhu property. A demolition squad had come to dismantle the temple. Somehow Mrs. N. had convinced an official in the city government to authorize demolition of the temple, a modest structure of brick and steel-reinforced concrete. When Girirāja attempted to show the officer in charge a letter establishing ISKCON’s rights, the man ignored the letter and signaled for the demolition to begin. Soon more trucks arrived, until nearly one hundred demolitionists, working with blowtorches and sledgehammers, swarmed over the property.\nThe demolitionists mounted ladders and began breaking the roof of the temple hall with sledgehammers. Others used torches to cut through the steel supports. The plan of the demolition squad was to knock out the steel supports of thekīrtanahall and proceed methodically toward the Deity house, wherein Rādhā-Rāsavihārī stood. The devotees tried to stop the demolition, but policemen soon appeared on the scene and, working in pairs, would grab the dissenters by the legs and arms and carry them away. Police dragged the women away by the hair, while tenants on the land looked on. Some were glad to see the demolition, although others were sympathetic. Out of fear of the police, however, no one moved to help the devotees.\nOne devotee, Maniṣvi, ran to a telephone and called Mr. Mahadevia, who, along with his friend Mr. Vinoda Gupta, rushed to Hare Krishna Land, to find the police dragging off the last protesting devotee by the hair. She had been trying to close the doors to the altar to protect the Deities when three policemen had wrestled her away. Mr. Mahadevia rushed to the house of a sympathetic tenant, Mr. Acarya, and phoned his brother Chandra Mahadevia, a wealthy businessman and friend of Bal Thakura, the leader of one of the most influential political parties in Bombay.\nMr. Chandra Mahadevia informed Bal Thakura of the emergency: at the instigation of a Hindu and under the order of a Hindu municipal officer, a Hindu temple of Lord Viṣṇu was being demolished. Mr. Thakura in turn informed the municipal commissioner, who denied knowing of any order to demolish the temple and who in turn phoned the local ward office that had sent out the demolition squad. The ward office sent a man to stop the demolition. The officer arrived around two P.M., just as the demolition squad had cut through the last pillars and were dismantling the roof above the Deities. The order to stop the demolition was given to the ward officer in charge, who then stopped the demolition squad.\nPrabhupāda was in Calcutta at the time of the attack, and when the devotees reached him by phone, he told them to organize the local ISKCON sympathizers and life members and protest the attack by mass publicity. They should also expose the persons responsible. This would be very effective against Mrs. N. and her party.\nPrabhupāda mentioned various life members he thought would help. Mr. Sada Jiwatlal, the head of the Hindu Viswa Parishad, should help with publicity, since his organization was a defender of Hindudharmaand was meant for handling such cases as this. Mr. Sethi should help in preventing further violence. This episode, Prabhupāda said, had been part of Kṛṣṇa’s plan; the devotees should not be afraid.\nThe next morning a photo of the demolished temple appeared on the front page of theFree Press Journalwith the headline, “UNAUTHORIZED TEMPLE DEMOLISHED BY MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES.”\nDevotees began counteracting the bad publicity. Mr. Sada Jiwatlal turned his downtown office into an ISKCON office, and he and the devotees began the campaign. Despite the unfavorable propaganda, many Indians were shocked at the violence, and the municipal corporation unanimously condemned those officials responsible for the attack on a Hindu temple. Devotees, working from six A.M. to nine P.M. at Sada Jiwatlal’s office, phoned the newspapers, wrote letters and circulars, and contacted possible sympathizers.\nMr. Vinoda Gupta, a member of the Jan-Sangh political party, which favored maintaining India’s Hindu culture, joined with Kartikeya Mahadevia and others to form a “Save the Temple” committee. Mr. Gupta published his own leaflet declaring ISKCON to be a bona fide Hindu organization. As Girirāja met with and elicited the support of government officials, many of Bombay’s leading citizens, appreciating the authenticity of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, began to show sympathy and offer assistance.\nThus the plan of Mrs. N. and her lawyers backfired. Although they had been thinking they were dealing with only a mere handful of young foreigners, they soon found themselves facing many of Bombay’s most influential citizens.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda predicted that the results would be positive. A few days after the incident he wrote,\nPrabhupāda also asked Girirāja to give full coverage of the temple demolition in hisHare Krishna Monthlyjournal to life members. Prabhupāda himself wrote an article for theMonthlydescribing his movement and the events leading to the attack on the temple. He condemned the Bombay municipality for having the “audacity to smash our temple, against the law and principle of religious faith.” A clique in Bombay, he said, had conspired to drive the devotees from their land without returning their money, and he asked for sympathizers and life members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to come forward and help him at this difficult hour.\nOnly about a dozen ISKCON life members responded to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s call. There were hundreds of life members in Bombay, each of whom had donated 1,111 rupees and were receiving Prabhupāda’s books. But when it came to a personal commitment in a time of controversy, only a few were willing to help. Those who did help, however, were able to assist in ways that the innocent, naive, and uninfluential disciples of Prabhupāda could not.\nThe devotees began to see the entire course of events as Kṛṣṇa’s mercy, since many life members were now rendering valuable service to Prabhupāda and Lord Kṛṣṇa. In the past Prabhupāda had stayed in the homes of many life members, preaching to them and their families, convincing them of his sincerity and of the noble aims of his movement. These friends and members – like Bhagubai Patel, Beharilal Khandelwala, Brijratan Mohatta, Dr. C. Bali, and others – were acting not simply out of Hindu sentiment but out of deep respect and affection for Prabhupāda.\nGirirāja, working with Sada Jiwatlal, tried to convince the municipal council to authorize the rebuilding of the temple structure. While doing so, however, he discovered that Mrs. N. had that very day (a Friday) filed for a court injunction preventing ISKCON from rebuilding. Justice Nain told Girirāja that he did not want to grant Mrs. N.’s request and that he would hear the devotee’s case on the following Monday. This meant that the devotees had from Saturday morning to Monday morning, two days, to rebuild the temple.\nThe devotees reasoned that, although they had no actual permission to rebuild the temple, there was as yet no law to stop them. If Justice Nain ruled against them, then to rebuild would be very difficult. They decided, therefore, to use the weekend to rebuild. Mr. Lal, a former contractor, helped arrange materials: bricks, mortar, asbestos sheets. Mr. Sethi offered a crew of laborers. At eight P.M. on Friday the masons began their work, continuing throughout the night despite the rain. And on Monday morning, when the judge learned of the new temple, he declared, “What is built is built. No one can destroy the temple.”\nWhen Prabhupāda heard the news, he considered it a complete victory. The temple had been rebuilt, and public opinion was swinging strongly in ISKCON’s favor."

        "chapter_title": "Developing Māyāpur",
        "content": "MāyāpurJune 1, 1973\nALTHOUGH THE MĀYĀPUR building was not yet completed, Prabhupāda had come there to reside. He took two adjoining rooms, one as his study and one as his bedroom, on the second floor. Meanwhile, construction work continued in the temple room and in other parts of the building. On Prabhupāda’s first day there, a storm struck, with massive black clouds and high winds. The storm was brief, however, and damage was minimal.\nIn the evening the templepūjārī,Jananivāsa, would come to Prabhupāda’s room with a clay pot of red coals and frankincense and fan the frankincense until the room was filled with smoke. This was to drive out insects, but Prabhupāda also considered it purifying.\nAlthough he was sometimes disturbed by the workers’ hammering, he found the atmosphere otherwise peaceful. Only a few devotees were staying there, and Prabhupāda gave his attention to translating or to speaking with guests and to the devotees in charge of developing his Māyāpur center. He would express his desires especially to Bhavānanda Mahārāja and Jayapatāka Mahārāja and worked his will through them.\nThe devotees living in the building with Prabhupāda considered themselves menial servants in Prabhupāda’s personal house. Of course, all the buildings in ISKCON belonged to Prabhupāda, yet in Māyāpur that sense was intensified. Generally the devotees in each particular center would raise money to support their center, but Prabhupāda personally took charge of getting funds for Māyāpur. He had begun a Māyāpur-Vṛndāvana Trust Fund of donations from his disciples and interest from bonds and security deposits. If money was misspent, energy misused, or the building damaged in any way, Prabhupāda would become very concerned. Now that he was personally on the scene, he often walked about, giving detailed instructions and demanding that discrepancies be corrected. The pink and reddish building was like a huge transcendental ship, and Śrīla Prabhupāda, as captain, would walk the wide verandas, giving strict orders to all mates for keeping everything shipshape.\nOne day Prabhupāda was walking on the veranda near his room. The other rooms were locked, and as Prabhupāda walked alone, he would open the window shutters and look in. Suddenly he turned to Śatadhanya, who waited on call nearby. “The fan is going on inside, and this room is empty and locked,” Prabhupāda said. “Who has done this?” Śatadhanya didn’t know. “Whoever has done this,” Prabhupāda said, “is a rascal! He should know he is a rascal!” For two days after, Prabhupāda continued to refer to the incident with disgust.\nOne day, after a huge wind and rainstorm, water covered the twelve-foot-wide marble veranda outside Prabhupāda’s room. Bhavānanda Goswami, taking a large squeegee a devotee had made, began cleaning the marble floor, and Śrīla Prabhupāda came to his door to watch. “This is the way to clean marble,” Prabhupāda said. “Don’t polish it with wax, but just keep plenty of fresh water and every day in the morning wipe it off. In this way the marble will become naturally polished and will shine like glass.”\nPrabhupāda felt affection and deep gratitude for those devotees dedicating their lives to the Māyāpur project. One night he called Bhavānanda to his room and began asking him about the devotees. Suddenly Prabhupāda began crying. “I know it is difficult for all you Western boys and girls,” he said. “You are so dedicated, serving here in my mission. I know you cannot even getprasādam.When I think that you cannot even get milk and that you have given up your opulent life to come here and you do not complain, I am very much indebted to all of you.”\nBhavānanda:The marble workers lived in somechāṭāihouses right near the construction site. There was a hand pump just outside the building, and that’s where we took our bath and where the workers got the water for the cement. Some distance off were two toilets – one for the men, one for the women. It was just two holes in the ground, and each hole surrounded by achāṭāiwall. The storms and the rain would come, and we would have to sludge through the mud in the fields to go to the toilets. There were snakes all over the place. It was wild! It was a construction site. No one lives on a construction site, but we did. Śrīla Prabhupāda made us move in there. It was good for us. No bathrooms, nothing – just open floors with concrete.\nAlthough the devotees endured the austerities of living at the Māyāpur center construction site, they sometimes felt it was too difficult. But Śrīla Prabhupāda never considered it difficult, and he would encourage the devotees: “Māyāpur is so wonderful. You can live on the air and water alone.”\nBhavānanda:We were able to face up to so many difficulties because we just took it as our order from Śrīla Prabhupāda. There was no conception of ever leaving. What else would I do? This was my order: “Take Māyāpur. I am giving you Māyāpur. Take it, develop it, and enjoy it.” There was no question in our minds of going somewhere else.\nThe surrounding grounds were rice fields, and to get to the temple building from the entrance of the property – a distance of more than two hundred yards – devotees would have to walk on paths made by ridges of earth that separated one rice field from another. The kitchen, which was made of tarpaulin and bamboo, was located near the entrance to the property.\nThe devotees had to live without electricity much of the time, since the power supply was often cut off. They would use kerosene lamps at night, and Prabhupāda said the lamps should be taken apart every day, the wicks trimmed, and the glass washed. “In the future,” he said, “you should grow castor plants and crush the seeds and take the oil for burning.”\nPrabhupāda told the devotees how to build simple dwellings. He also wanted them to build a wall with a gate along the front of the property. They should build small rooms – hutments, he called them – against the wall. Devotees could stay in these simple cottages. They should plant coconut and banana trees.\nMore often, however, Śrīla Prabhupāda displayed a roselike softness, an intimate, informal, and affectionate nature. The holydhāmaof Māyāpur was the spiritual world, Goloka Vṛndāvana; so the devotees there were living with Prabhupāda in the spiritual world. More than most any other place in the world, the devotees living in Māyāpur knew they could walk into Prabhupāda’s room and see him. He sometimes even walked into their rooms. While they were working, reading, or talking, he might suddenly walk in and speak with them, asking how they felt and how they were adjusting to living in India. “It is difficult living here?” he would ask. “I think India is too hot. What do you think?”\n“You should always be able to offer water, hotpurīsand eggplantbhājī(fried eggplant), and sweets,” Prabhupāda said. Even when guests appeared shy, Prabhupāda would insist they take a full meal. Mrs. Mohatta, even though a member of one of the wealthiest families in India, was satisfied with the simple hospitality Śrīla Prabhupāda and his disciples offered. The room she and her husband stayed in was unfinished – the slate floors hadn’t been polished, and construction work was going on all around – and the devotees could only offer them a mattress on the floor with a pillow, yet they appeared to be quite satisfied and appreciative.\nBhavānanda:Śrīla Prabhupāda introduced us to many of the details of Indian culture at Māyāpur. He had us put down mattresses covered with sheets in his room. In 1970, in Los Angeles, he had asked me to sew sheets together to make a covering for the rug in his room. And then he had gotten down on his hands and knees right next to me, and we had smoothed out the wrinkles in the sheet.\nSo he had us do that same thing in Māyāpur, where we put mattresses from one end of the room to the other with bolster pillows against the wall. “Now you have white sheet covers,” he said, “and you change these every day.” When Bengali gentlemen visited Śrīla Prabhupāda in his room, they would sit on these mattresses around the edge of the room, their backs against the bolster pillows.\nIt was very aristocratic. The whole mood was that he was themahant,the master of the house, theācārya,but also the aristocratic Bengali gentlemen saw that he was reestablishing the old aristocratic mood from the early 1900’s or 1920’s. It was from Prabhupāda’s old days with the Mullik family and it was rapidly dwindling. At that time you couldn’t find a semblance of the old culture anywhere, because all those families had become degraded, and their wealth gone.\nWhile a few devotees sat on the sheet-covered mattresses in his room, Prabhupāda sat on his slightly raisedāsana,leaning back against a white bolster pillow. Both spiritual master and disciple enjoyed bliss in speaking and hearing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The devotees wanted to hear Prabhupāda’s words and follow his will, and he wanted to instruct them.\n“But these insects,” Prabhupāda continued, “are not perfect. They are flying to the light. That also means they are attracted to death. So they are just like the materialists. The materialists are building skyscrapers, yet they don’t know what will happen at death. Henry Ford and other big capitalists had to die. But so many others are trying to become just like them. They do not know it means their death also. They are like these small insects. In the morning we simply find heaps of them, all dead.”\nOften while Prabhupāda was talking in his room the lights would suddenly go out, and devotees would bring in kerosene lamps. And each night, while Prabhupāda was speaking, thepūjārīwould come, filling the room with frankincense smoke. Ghee lamps faintly illuminated the large teakwood bas-relief carving of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa on the wall opposite Prabhupāda’s desk.\nTo execute such a project, Prabhupāda wanted to train his disciples in the Vedic arts, now dying in Bengal. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had been greatly interested in using dioramas to depict thelīlāof Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya, and now Prabhupāda wanted his own disciples to learn the art by studying under local Māyāpur artists.\nIn June Baradrāja, Ādideva, Mūrti, and Īśāna arrived to begin learning the art of doll-making. Prabhupāda also wanted a disciple to learn to makemṛdaṅgas,and a potter began coming every day to teach Īśāna how to mold and fire the clay shells. The devotees converted Prabhupāda’s original straw cottage into a workshop, and Prabhupāda began inviting other disciples to come to Māyāpur.\nThe Māyāpur city, Prabhupāda said, would be the fulfillment of the desires of the previousācāryas.The city would grow to a population of fifty thousand and would become the spiritual capital of the world. With its gigantic temple in the center and separate quarters forbrāhmaṇas,kṣatriyas,vaiśyas,andśūdras,the city would be a model for all other cities. The day would come when the world’s cities would be ruined, and humanity would take refuge in cities modeled after Māyāpur. The development of Māyāpur would mark the beginning of a Kṛṣṇa conscious world. Thus the influence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would increase, and His prediction would manifest: “In every town and village My name will be chanted.”\nPrabhupāda said that Māyāpur should eventually become more easily accessible – by bridge from Navadvīpa, by motor launch up the Ganges from Calcutta, and from all parts by air. In Bengal millions were by birth followers of Lord Caitanya, and they would recognize and take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness as the pure form of their own culture. There is a saying: What Bengal does, the rest of India follows. So if Bengal became reformed and purified by the Kṛṣṇa conscious example of American Vaiṣṇavas, then all India would follow. And when all India became Kṛṣṇa conscious, the whole world would follow. “I have given you the kingdom of God,” Prabhupāda said to his Māyāpur managers. “Now take it, develop it, and enjoy it.”\nPrabhupāda praised the constant pleasurable breezes that passed through the building – he called them “Vaikuṇṭha breezes.” Sometimes, however, a violent storm would suddenly appear. Although severe, these storms were also beautiful, with continuous lightning like neon lights filling the sky. One day a storm arose, and the winds began to howl through the building. Noticing that Prabhupāda’s doors and windows were open, Śatadhanya rushed into the room and began frantically closing them. But Prabhupāda, seated at his desk, said, “Stop, leave all the windows open.”\n“Prabhupāda,” Śatadhanya protested, “the storm is here.”\n“Just leave them open,” Prabhupāda said, as the wind rushed through his room at more than fifty miles an hour. Prabhupāda smiled. “There is no place in the world like this!” he said, his saffron robes billowing.\nWhile in Calcutta, before coming to Māyāpur, Prabhupāda had called several senior disciples into his room. “I have had many requests,” he had said to them, “to translateCaitanya-bhāgavata.But I am going to translate the entireCaitanya-caritāmṛta.Is that all right?”\n“Oh, yes, Prabhupāda,” Bhavānanda Goswami had replied, “that’s wonderful.”\nDecades ago Prabhupāda had written essays based on theCaitanya-caritāmṛta,and over the years he had translated some of the verses and written purports to them. Then in America in 1968 he had completedTeachings of Lord Caitanya,a summary study based on certain important passages ofCaitanya-caritāmṛta.During his stay in Māyāpur, however, he began anew a translation and commentary of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja’sCaitanya-caritāmṛta,beginning with the Seventh Chapter. As he progressed, he found a wonderful momentum and said he would publish a volume, starting with Chapter Seven, for Lord Caitanya’s appearance day in March. Deciding to complete the entireCaitanya-caritāmṛta,he suspended his work onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nIn one of the first verses of the Seventh Chapter, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja states, “Let me offer my obeisances to Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who has manifested Himself in five, as a devotee, expansion of a devotee, incarnation of a devotee, pure devotee, and devotional energy.” Prabhupāda wrote that the only way for people to be elevated in love of Kṛṣṇa in the Age of Kali is by the mercy of the Pañca-tattva, or Lord Caitanya in His form of five personalities. One should offer obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting the Pañca-tattvamantra,śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.Thismantrashould be recited before one chants themahā-mantra,Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. “There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇamahā-mantra,” Prabhupāda wrote, “but these are not considered in the chanting of the Pañca-tattvamahā-mantra… One must first take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learn the Pañca-tattvamahā-mantra,and then chant the Hare Kṛṣṇamahā-mantra.”\nVerse after verse of the Seventh Chapter confirmed the essential principles of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mission and attested that he was teaching exactly after the method advised by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.\nIn commenting on these verses Prabhupāda wrote,\nBy the phrase “Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement,” Prabhupāda spoke not only of his own disciples and his Kṛṣṇa consciousness society but also of the movement inaugurated by Lord Caitanya. Just as the original Personality of Godhead and the Deity of Kṛṣṇa in the temple were the same, so the movement of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Prabhupāda’s Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement were identical.\nFor Śrīla Prabhupāda, this verse directly confirmed the instruction he had received from his spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, that people of all births could become Vaiṣṇavas,brāhmaṇas,andsannyāsīs.Here was direct evidence from the scripture, yet Prabhupāda, like his own spiritual master, had often received criticism from the caste-consciousbrāhmaṇasof India. With the proof in hand, Prabhupāda now challenged his envious critics.\nAnother criticism Śrīla Prabhupāda encountered was that his emphasis on proselytizing was actually alien to Indian spirituality. Even Prabhupāda’s Godbrothers had occasionally made such remarks. More often, however, this sentiment came from the impersonalists, who argued that people should be left to conceive of religion in their own ways; religion, being an internal, spiritual affair, should not be propagated by zealous evangelism. Preaching and conversion, they said, were for the Christians, not for followers of Indian religion. In the Seventh Chapter ofCaitanya-caritāmṛta’s Ādi-līlā,however, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, reveals His heart and emotion as the ideal preacher.\nThis was Śrīla Prabhupāda’s spirit in training young men and women in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and he was offering these words of Lord Caitanya to strengthen all the Lord’s devotees. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should be confident that by preaching purely they would meet with success. Prabhupāda was confident. Here were the words ofśāstra,words spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And Prabhupāda’s personal experience confirmed the same. Thus he could write,\nThe verses of the Seventh Chapter described a worldwide inundation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus the objections that Europeans and Americans could not becomebrāhmaṇasorsannyāsīswould be swept away as Lord Caitanya’s mercy flooded the entire world. Nothing could check it.\nThe words of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja intensified Prabhupāda’s desire to base his worldwide movement in the land where Lord Caitanya appeared and began Hissaṅkīrtanamovement. The Pañca-tattva had begun in Navadvīpa, and from here the waves of love of Godhead were swelling outward.\nIn this Seventh Chapter of theĀdi-līlā,Prabhupāda found many other evidences authorizing ISKCON under the principles of Lord Caitanya’s teachings and activities. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja says that Lord Caitanya’s takingsannyāsawas a trick for delivering certain classes of society who would otherwise not have shown Him respect. Prabhupāda, in his commentary, explained that he also had devised schemes for offering the benefits of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to as wide a spectrum of society as possible, and he cited his acceptance of women into the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. “Therefore it is a principle,” he wrote, “that a preacher must strictly follow the rules and regulations laid down in theśāstra,yet at the same time devise a means by which the preaching work to reclaim the fallen may go on with full force.”\nJune 27, 1973From Māyāpur Śrīla Prabhupāda went to Calcutta. He wrote to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami,\nWhile considering his itinerary, Prabhupāda passed some days in the Calcutta temple on Albert Road. He was very free about allowing people to see him, and his room was often filled with local Bengalis as well as his own disciples, seated on the white sheet before him. In the evenings he would go, even when it meant riding for miles through congested parts of the city, to spend an hour in someone’s home, preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s sister, Bhavatāriṇī (known as Pisimā to Prabhupāda’s disciples), would also visit the Calcutta temple to see her beloved brother and, as usual, to cook for him. One day, however, a few hours after eating herkacaurīs,Prabhupāda felt sharp pains in his stomach. He closed his doors and went to bed. His followers became very concerned. When his servant, Śrutakīrti, came into the room, he found him tossing.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda, what’s wrong?”\n“My stomach,” Prabhupāda replied. “That coconutkacaurī –it was not cooked.”\nThe seizure continued all night, and several devotees continually massaged Prabhupāda’s body, especially his stomach. But with every breath he would moan. Pisimā was standing by, but Prabhupāda’s disciples feared her presence, thinking she might want to cook something else for him, even in his illness.\nPrabhupāda asked that the picture of Lord Nṛsiṁha be taken from the altar and put beside his bed. Some devotees feared that Prabhupāda might be about to pass away. The next morning, when the illness continued, the devotees called for the localkavirāja(Ayurvedic doctor).\nThe oldkavirājacame and diagnosed Prabhupāda’s illness as severe blood dysentery. He left medicine, but it was ineffectual. Later, when Prabhupāda called Bhavānanda to his room and requested friedpurīswith a littlepaṭala[an Indian vegetable similar to a small squash] and salt, Bhavānanda protested; such fried foods would be the worst thing for him. Prabhupāda said that this was the blood dysentery cure his mother had given during his childhood. He then called for his sister, and speaking to her in Bengali, told her to preparepurīsandpaṭala.A few hours after taking the food, Prabhupāda again called Bhavānanda; he was feeling better. “My mother was right,” he remarked.\nA lengthy telegram arrived from Śyāmasundara, glorifying the preaching opportunities that awaited Prabhupāda in London, where he would be picked up at the airport in a helicopter and flown to the main event – the greatest Ratha-yātrā ever held. The parade would proceed down Picadilly Lane, climaxing under a large pavilion at Trafalgar Square. The telegram went on to say that millions of Englishmen – including certain very, very important people – were eager to see Śrīla Prabhupāda and that arrangements were underway for Prabhupāda to instruct the Queen’s eldest son, Prince Charles, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nSome of the promises were exaggerated, Śrīla Prabhupāda knew, but his desire to preach again in England was strong. George Harrison had given the devotees a large estate forty-five minutes outside of London, and Prabhupāda spoke of going there and installing Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa on Janmāṣṭamī day. Yet even now, over a month before Janmāṣṭamī, he was feeling deeply affected by Śyāmasundara’s invitation. Although still exhausted from dysentery, he considered flying immediately to London.\nCalling in those G.B.C. secretaries andsannyāsīswith him in Calcutta, sitting up in bed while they sat before him on the floor, Prabhupāda asked their advice. They concluded that he should go to a healthier climate – Los Angeles or Hawaii – to rest and recuperate. Prabhupāda mildly agreed as his advisors decided Hawaii would be the best place, a place where the climate was ideal and where he would have few interruptions. Suddenly, however, he sat up straighter. He would return to the West, he said, but to London, not to Hawaii. And not to recuperate, but to preach!\n“Let me strike while the iron is hot,” he said. “I think that is an English maxim. If you do that, then you can keep the iron in shape. In the West, people are fed up. So we want to give them spiritual enlightenment.”\nPrabhupāda had immediately convinced his disciples with his forceful statements. “There are two misleading theories in the West,” he continued. “One is that life comes from matter, and the other is that there is no life after death – you can just enjoy this life. They say everything is matter. So as this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement grows, the Communists will be curbed down. People say they are trying for unity, but they have no brains to see how this will achieve unity. They have formed a big complicated League of Nations and now United Nations, but they all fail. But this simple method of Ratha-yātrā – all over the world it is spreading.Jagannāthameans ‘Lord of the universe.’ So Lord Jagannātha is now international God, through our ISKCON. Therefore, I want to go to the West and give them these things.”\nAlthough Prabhupāda appeared physically unfit to immediately fly to London to the active preaching that awaited him, his disciples submitted, accepting this as another miracle by Kṛṣṇa.\nLondonJuly 7, 1973Paravidha:It was Ratha-yātrā day. I saw Prabhupāda coming into the temple, and he didn’t look very strong. I was really amazed, but I could understand that his strength was something spiritual.\nDhruvanātha:At the parade site we were waiting to receive Śrīla Prabhupāda at Marble Arch, where the procession starts. Thevyāsāsanawas nicely decorated, and everybody was expecting Prabhupāda simply to sit on hisvyāsāsanaon the cart and just ride through the streets, just as he had done in the other Ratha-yātrās. So it was to our great amazement and joy that when Prabhupāda came, he refused to sit on thevyāsāsana.He indicated that he would dance and lead the procession!\nYogeśvara:They brought stairs up so Prabhupāda could mount therathacart and sit down on thevyāsāsana.But he waved them off and just started walking with the chariots, leading the dancing.\nDhīraśānta:I twisted my ankle and couldn’t walk, so I rode on the cart. Therefore I could see Prabhupāda very clearly. Revatīnandana Mahārāja was chanting into the microphone from the cart, but after about fifteen minutes of the procession Prabhupāda told the devotees to tell Revatīnandana Mahārāja and the others to come down and lead thekīrtanain the street with him.\nRevatīnandana:When Prabhupāda saw hisvyāsāsanaon the cart, he said, “No, I am just a devotee. I will go in the procession.” We had a big, greatkīrtana.Haṁsadūta led, I led, Śyāmasundara led – different devotees traded off, leading this fantastickīrtana.And Prabhupāda was right in the middle of thekīrtanawith hiskaratālasthe whole time. He was dancing back and forth and jumping up and down and dancing.\nRohiṇī-nandana:The cart was going quite slowly. Prabhupāda walked about twenty or thirty yards ahead of the cart, leading the procession. Meanwhile thekīrtanawas coming from therathacart through microphones. Prabhupāda called them all down, and he got them all around himself, and they were chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Ever so often he would turn around and raise both his arms very majestically in the air and say, “JayaJagannātha!” Sometimes we would get a little further ahead, so then he would turn around and wait for the cart to come on. Sometimes he was dancing, and sometimes he would stand, raising his hands in the air.\nŚāradīyā dāsī:Prabhupāda would dance, and then after a few feet he would turn around and look up at the deities with his arms raised. Then he would dance for a few moments, meditating on the deities, and then he would turn around and go on. In this way he danced the entire way. The devotees held hands in a circle around him to protect him from the crowd. It was a wonderful, transcendental affair. Prabhupāda was looking up at the deities, and all the devotees were behind him.\nSudurjaya:Prabhupāda surprised us. We didn’t know if he was sick or not, feeling weak and dizzy or not. Sometimes he looked very ill, and sometimes he looked like an eighteen-year-old boy. He surprised us. He had his cane in his hand but raised it in the air as he danced. After a while, Śyāmasundara came up to me and said, “Listen, he’s not going to make it. Prabhupāda is very ill. I want you to follow in a car. Be within thirty seconds’ reach so we can put Prabhupāda in the car immediately.” Prabhupāda was going down Park Lane, and from time to time he would turn back and raise his hands. He was going so fast that they couldn’t pull the cart fast enough to keep up with him. He would have to wait for the cart to catch up. He would turn back, raise his hands, and say, “Haribol!” Several times he did this. He was going so fast that he had to wait. The devotees were dancing, the weather was beautiful, and the crowd was wonderful.\nDhruvanātha:The passersby were rooted to the spot, looking at Prabhupāda. A man of that age simply dancing and jumping in the air like a young boy was the most amazing sight! And then every five minutes or so Prabhupāda would turn around and look toward Jagannātha. The devotees would clear the way so no one blocked his sight, and he had a perfect view of Jagannātha, Balarāma, and Subhadrā. But after a while the police came and motioned that we couldn’t keep stopping like this. We had to keep the whole thing going, because the traffic jams were becoming critical. Devotees were crying and chanting and dancing, and there was much commotion.\nŚrutakīrti:When Prabhupāda was dancing, the bobbies kept on coming up and looking for someone official. Finally they came to me and said, “You’ll have to tell your leader to sit down. He’s causing too much of a disturbance. Everyone is becoming wild, and we can’t control the crowd, you know.” So I said, “All right.” But I didn’t say anything to Prabhupāda.\nSo then they came again and said, “You must tell him he’ll have to sit down.” So I said, “All right,” and I tapped Prabhupāda. The whole time he had been in ecstasy, dancing before the cart and encouraging everyone else to dance. He would motion with his hands and encourage the devotees to keep dancing. He kept the momentum of the festival. So I said, “Prabhupāda, the policemen want you to sit down. They say you are creating havoc in the parade.” Prabhupāda looked at me, turned, and kept on. He completely ignored it and kept on dancing. And they couldn’t do anything. Prabhupāda wouldn’t stop, and the police wouldn’t say anything to him.\nParavidha:I was distributingBack to Godheadmagazines along the whole parade route. I was exhausted, and I was having a lot of trouble keeping up with the procession. But Prabhupāda was just there, and he was dancing like a young boy. I was amazed at his spiritual energy.\nDhruvanātha:When we came to Picadilly Circus, Prabhupāda suddenly stopped the whole procession. Picadilly Circus, of course, was just packed with people. For about three minutes Prabhupāda stopped the procession and just danced and danced with the devotees all around him.\nRohiṇī-nandana:When we got to Picadilly Circus, Prabhupāda really started to dance. He was leaping off the ground. The cart was stopped. It was very similar, actually, to the description in theCaitanya-caritāmṛtaof how Lord Caitanya would lead the Ratha-yātrā procession. So the cart was stopped, and then Prabhupāda would wait for it to catch up.\nYogeśvara:When we finally arrived at Trafalgar Square and Prabhupāda saw the big tent and the other arrangements the devotees had made, he held up his hands again. He had been dancing and walking the entire route of the parade. It must have been at least an hour that he had been walking and dancing – all the way from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square.\nRohiṇī-nandana:When Prabhupāda got to Trafalgar Square, he immediately sat down on the plinth of Nelson’s Column on a littlevyāsāsanaand delivered a lecture about the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. This was directly after his marathon of chanting and dancing.\nThe next day’s papers carried favorable news coverage of the festival, and Prabhupāda wrote of it to a disciple in Los Angeles.\nIn another letter Prabhupāda wrote,\nPrabhupāda said that if the devotees would clean out the lake and keep up the grounds, then he would stay always at Bhaktivedanta Manor and translate here in peace. They should get some cows, he said, and use some of the extra acreage for farming.\nAlthough the devotees had not long been living in the Manor and had done little to improve the buildings and grounds, Prabhupāda pointed out a place where they could one day build a thirty-story temple, the grandest building in all of London. He proposed that he stay for at least two months and install Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities on Janmāṣṭamī day; he would also oversee the construction of the temple room and altar.\nEvery morning at about six Prabhupāda would leave the Manor for an hour’s walk. There was no restriction as to who could join him, and sometimes as many as twenty devotees would trail behind, trying to hear anything he might say. Looking off toward the horizon, he commented that Letchmore Heath reminded him of Vṛndāvana.\nPrabhupāda would walk down the lane to a place called Round Bush, stroll past a wheat field, and finally return to Letchmore Heath and the Manor. A local policeman had become friends with the devotees and would regularly exchange greetings with Prabhupāda. Particularly Prabhupāda liked the cleanliness of the little village, and he would often point out even the smallest pieces of trash on the Manor grounds. The village, he said, was much neater than American towns.\nPrabhupāda was always eager to glorify Kṛṣṇa and repeat Kṛṣṇa’s message, and with complete, enthusiastic freshness he would present again the same points he had presented many, many times before. He said he was like a cow that gives milk in any field. Put him in India or America or England – he would always give the same nectarean milk ofBhagavad-gītā.\nPrabhupāda’s entire day – his early-morning dictation ofCaitanya-caritāmṛta,morning walk,Bhagavad-gītālecture, talks with guests –  revolved around philosophy. In Scotland, when a man had challenged that God needn’t be presented through philosophy, Prabhupāda had replied, “What do you expect me to talk, some fairy tales?” Philosophy was necessary, especially for the so-called intelligent persons, whose minds raised so many intellectual doubts. And besides, to always be telling others about Kṛṣṇa, Prabhupāda said, was a symptom of love.\nMoved by compassion for others’ suffering, Prabhupāda always spoke the message of Kṛṣṇa and never tired of repeating it. He was genuinely angered by the atheistic speculators who mislead the people, because materialistic and impersonalistic philosophies ruined a person’s chances of finding the solution to life’s suffering. Whenever Prabhupāda heard anyone arguing the Māyāvāda doctrine, he would become like fire. He could not tolerate it. He had to correct it. When, after one of Prabhupāda’s lectures at the Manor, a boy had said he had heard someone call the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa “a little bit of a bluff,” Prabhupāda had replied, “Who saysbluff?Who is that fool? Who is that rascal?” He had been ready to fight the atheist to glorify Kṛṣṇa.\nThese were Prabhupāda’s natural drives; therefore he could go on and on, without stopping. He wanted to give people Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He had no other life. Even while relaxing in the privacy of his room he always spoke of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nThe devotees had invited many prominent British citizens to meet Śrīla Prabhupāda, and the responses were good. Economist Ernst Schumacher promised to visit, as did philosopher Sir Alfred J. Ayer. When Śyāmasundara informed Prabhupāda that Mr. Ayer was well known, Prabhupāda replied, “What is his philosophy?”\n“Well,” Śyāmasundara replied, “he doesn’t believe in the existence of God.”\n“I will give him evidence,” Prabhupāda replied. “I will ask him what he means by ‘the existence of God.’ I will ask him to make a list of the deficiencies of God’s existence.” Prabhupāda liked to meet with philosophical men and “corner them and defeat them.”\nHistorian Arnold Doyenne was old and invalid; therefore, Prabhupāda agreed to visit him at his residence. Interested in discussing life after death, Dr. Doyenne asked Prabhupāda aboutkarma.Most people, he said, were afraid of death. Prabhupāda agreed and added that according to a certain astrologer, one of India’s recent leaders had taken birth as a dog. “So they are afraid they will go down,” he said. When Doyenne asked ifkarmacould be changed, Prabhupāda replied yes, but only bybhakti,devotion to God.\nArnold Doyenne: “Not many people in the West are thinking of this.”\nPrabhupāda: “They are less intelligent. It is not good. If they take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they can continue to work and live in the city, but they can change their consciousness. Then automatically everything will come.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda asked Dr. Toynbee about the book he was writing, and the professor replied that it concerned ancient Greece’s influence on the Greece of today. “The Greeks came from India,” Prabhupāda said. “Vedic culture was once all over the world. Gradually, a new type of culture – just like this recent partition of India and Pakistan – took place.”\nPrabhupāda explained how in the future the governments would fall to rascals and thieves, whose only business would be to exploit the citizens. Food would be scarce. And the governments would levy so many taxes that the people would be harassed and go to the forests for shelter. Only the God conscious people would be free. The future would be an ocean of faults, with but one saving factor: simply by chanting Kṛṣṇa’s names one could be freed. Even now, Prabhupāda said, the hippies were going to the forest, and the men were separated from their wives and money and were going to the hills and forests in disappointment. “You can predict the future in this way,” Prabhupāda said.\nArnold Toynbee: “In India did the politicians keep theVedas?”\nPrabhupāda: “No, they threw them away. Present Indian politicians are not very satisfied with theVedas.They threw them in the water. I have started, among the Indians and Americans, and for the next ten thousand years Kṛṣṇa consciousness will increase. Then there will be a gloomy picture of Kali-yuga. Ten thousand years is not a short time. It is our duty on behalf of Kṛṣṇa.”\nArnold Toynbee: “Do you travel much?”\nPrabhupāda: “All over the world.”\nThe next morning on his walk Prabhupāda continued discussing his talk with the priest. “In the name of religion,” Prabhupāda said, “they are killing. TheBhāgavatamsays this cheating religion is kicked out and simply worship of God is instated.”\nDevotee: “The priest last night said that Jesus ate meat.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then Jesus contradicted himself. He also said, ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ One shouldn’t imitate theīśvaras.A hippie-type mendicant in India takesgāñjāand claims to be a devotee of Śiva. No, we should not imitate the powerful controllers. That priest said also that the Bible does not say, ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ but ‘Thou shalt not murder.’ So I told him that if the word is actually ‘Thou shalt not murder’ in the original Hebrew, then Jesus must have been preaching to the fourth-class, tenth-class men – murderers. And the proof is that they murdered him. So such people, what can they understand about God? When I told him, the priest was silent. He could not answer.”\nAnother priest came to see Prabhupāda, and again the question came up. Prabhupāda asked him, “Then you are in favor of killing?”\nThe priest replied, “Well, it is a fallen world.”\n“It is a fallen world,” said Prabhupāda, “but we do not have to be among the fallen.” The priest cited the covenant with Noah.\nPrabhupāda replied, “Maybe Noah allowed it at that time, the time of devastation, but that doesn’t mean you always have to do it. To live in such a time, one can eat anything to stay alive, but now so many things are in abundance to keep healthy without maintaining a slaughterhouse. In theBhagavad-gītāKṛṣṇa says, ‘Protect the cows; it is the duty of thevaiśyas.’ ”\nAlthough Prabhupāda willingly discussed with Christians, he admitted privately that to argue with them was a waste of time. “They will never agree,” he said, “even if they are defeated.” The best way to preach to people in general was through the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, as at the Ratha-yātrā festival. Chant, dance, takeprasādam,and invite everyone to join. “Anyway,” he said, “they don’t even follow their teachings. One boy came to me and said he wanted to talk. He said, ‘I am a Christian,’ but I told him, ‘You are not a Christian. Thou shalt not kill.’ ”\n“But the Christians say there is no future life,” the man said. “At the end of this one you either go to heaven or hell.”\n“But if they talk about going to heaven,” said Prabhupāda, “then that is the next life. But knowledge of Kṛṣṇa is only for the most perfect out of thousands among men.”\nPrabhupāda disagreed. “All we need is dedication,” he said. “I am not a great Sanskrit scholar, but I am pulling on. And even the scholars say it is good. My Guru Mahārāja’s Guru Mahārāja [Gaurakiśora dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja] was illiterate. Still, his disciple, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda, was the greatest scholar of the day. But when Gaurakiśora spoke, it was exactly from theśāstra.Our principle is not to take time to learn something and become expert and then preach. But whatever you know, preach. Class in the morning, class in the evening, and if they read my books, that is sufficient.”\n“No,” George protested, preferring the mood of a humble disciple, “it is Kṛṣṇa’s house and your room.”\nWhen George confided to Prabhupāda that by taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness he was losing friends, Prabhupāda told him not to worry. He read to George from theGītā,where Kṛṣṇa explains that He can be known only by devotional service.\n“In the future,” said George, “ISKCON will be so large it will require executive management.”\nPrabhupāda: “I have divided the world into twelve zones with twelve representatives. As long as they keep to the spiritual principles, Kṛṣṇa will help them.”\nBefore leaving, George assured Prabhupāda that he would help him increase his temples. Later Prabhupāda commented, “George is getting inward hope from Kṛṣṇa.”\n“Yes,” Allen replied, “I still chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, but I also chant other things.”\nAllen asked if Prabhupāda would like to hear his chanting and playing. Prabhupāda nodded. Allen began playing his harmonium and chantingoṁ.With each recitation of the wordoṁ,his voice went deeper –“Oooom.”\nWhen the chant was over, Prabhupāda began to laugh. “You can chant whatever you want to chant,” he said. “But just keep chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. As long as you are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, then everything else is all right.” Prabhupāda then allowed many devotees to join them for a big, blissfulkīrtana.\n“But money is material,” Donovan’s girlfriend interrupted.\n“What do you know what is material and spiritual?” Prabhupāda said. He turned to Donovan, “Do you understand?” Donovan humbly replied that he was thickheaded but trying. Donovan’s girlfriend then leaned over and whispered something into his ear, whereupon Donovan stood up and said, “Well, we have to go now.” Prabhupāda insisted that at least they first take someprasādam.\nAs soon as the guests left, Prabhupāda and his disciples began to laugh. Prabhupāda said, “She was thinking…” and he encouraged his disciples to finish the sentence.\n“Yes,” said Yogeśvara, “she was thinking that if Kṛṣṇa gets him, then she will lose him.”\nA month passed at the Manor, and still several weeks remained before Janmāṣṭamī and the Deity installation. So when Bhagavān requested Prabhupāda to come for a visit to Paris and install Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities, Prabhupāda agreed.\nParisAugust 9, 1973The devotees had arranged an official City Hall reception for Śrīla Prabhupāda. In the presence of the mayor of Paris and his government entourage, Śrīla Prabhupāda said that if the government leaders do not teach the citizens genuine God consciousness, then they are not responsible leaders. Reporting this talk in the next day’s paper, a news writer stated that the swami even criticized Napoleon Bonaparte.\nBhagavān:We had just moved into our new temple at 4 Rue le Sueur, Paris, and we had received forty-eight-inch Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa Deities. Prabhupāda had Pradyumna chanting themantrasand pouring the substances on the Deities while Prabhupāda himself looked on from hisvyāsāsana,giving directions. I was assisting, and at one point I turned around and saw Śrīla Prabhupāda standing right next to me, taking the substances in his own hands and smearing them over the lotuslike face of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. After the Deities were installed on the altar, Śrīla Prabhupāda came up and offered theāratiand I assisted him by handing him the articles.\nAfter the installation we went up to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room and very anxiously requested him to please give a name for the Deities. He sat back in his chair and said that the Deities will be known as Rādhā-Paris-īśvara. He then went on to say that in India people look to England for education and to Paris for sense gratification. He began to laugh and said that Kṛṣṇa has come to Paris in order to get somegopīs,some French girls, because the faces of the women in Paris are considered the most beautiful. “Rādhārāṇī is so beautiful,” Prabhupāda said, “just like a Paris girl. And Kṛṣṇa has come here to find out this most beautiful of all thegopīs.So He is Paris-īśvara.”\nAugust 15Prabhupāda returned to London and the latest mail from India. A legal complication had arisen regarding the deed for ISKCON’s land in Hyderabad. Prabhupāda wrote his disciple Mahāṁsa, cautioning him to avoid becoming entangled in another Bombay affair. When Prabhupāda also received word that the temple construction was progressing in Vṛndāvana, he replied,\nIn a letter to a disciple in Hawaii, Prabhupāda apologized for not replying to a letter.\nWriting to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami in Bombay, Prabhupāda was as attentive as ever to the ongoing troubles there. Although the devotees remained in possession of the land and had rebuilt their temporary temple, no purchase settlement was in sight.\nAnd Prabhupāda wrote to his disciples in Māyāpur,\nPrabhupāda also answered dozens of letters from America, where the devotees were becoming more and more keen to distribute his books. Their letters contained very crucial questions that only Prabhupāda could solve: How important was book distribution? Could the devotees abandon their robes and wear regular Western clothes to better distribute books in public? Was chanting on the streets more important than book distribution? What about taking buses and vans around the country? Could they travel with Deities in the vans? The devotees generally mentioned their own viewpoint in their letters to Prabhupāda, and yet they respectfully awaited his definitive reply.\nThe Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was now big, with potential for growing much bigger. And within ISKCON, Prabhupāda’s will was so powerful that a single letter from him would establish a policy for years to come. Prabhupāda appeared to be sitting quietly in his room at the Manor, following his daily routine of bathing, eating, and meeting evening guests, yet at the same time he was directing thousands of young men and women all over the world and sending them into action in the war againstmāyā.\nThe devotees continued to request clarification as to how far the ends justified the means in fulfilling Prabhupāda’s order to distribute books profusely. Śrīla Prabhupāda, being free of any material motivation, could clearly see the Kṛṣṇa conscious thing to do.\nPrabhupāda’s instructions were so important to his disciples that a letter from him was as effective as a personal visit. By such letters he maintained the lives and affairs of his disciples all over the world. Each day in the late morning he would have his secretary read aloud each incoming letter, and usually he would dictate the answer without delay. He had often said that thevāṇī,or order, of theguruwas more important than thevapuḥ,or personal presence. Thus by his letters he established and illuminated the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for his sincere followers.\nIn America now Prabhupāda’s preaching was primarily through the distribution of his books, whereas in India it was through establishing temples. Yet both methods were one and the same to him. And although his vision encompassed the whole world, he felt and described himself as only the humble servant of his spiritual master. Whether sitting peacefully on the lawn of the Manor and teasing one of the little children or directing one of his lieutenants to “drop thousands and millions of books into the laps of the conditioned souls,” whether meditating with great energy on the next phrase in hisŚrīmad-Bhāgavatampurports or worrying about what Mrs. N. was conspiring in Bombay – he always tried to serve his Guru Mahārāja.\nAugust 21M. Rasgotra, the Indian ambassador to England, attended the Janmāṣṭamī day celebration and introduced Śrīla Prabhupāda, expressing his appreciation of Prabhupāda’s great work. Prabhupāda spoke, describing the advent of Kṛṣṇa as the key to peace for the troubled material world. “Especially in India,” he said, “we have got so much asset for understanding God. Everything is there, ready-made. But we won’t accept. So what is the remedy for such disease? We are searching after peace, but we won’t accept anything which is actually giving us peace. This is our disease. So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to awaken the dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness in everyone’s heart. Otherwise, how could these Europeans and Americans and other countrymen who had never even heard of Kṛṣṇa four or five years ago be taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness so seriously? Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness is there in everyone’s heart.”\nPrabhupāda recited prayers fromBrahma-saṁhitādescribing the sublime, eternal existence of Kṛṣṇa on His eternal planet, Kṛṣṇaloka. “But Kṛṣṇa is also everywhere,” he explained, “and if you are a devotee, then you can catch Him. If you want to catch Him, He comes forward ten times more than your desire. Therefore we simply have to receive Him. This Deity worship in the temple means worshiping Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He has very kindly accepted to assume a form which you can handle. Therefore do not think that we have installed a marble statue. The rascals will say, ‘They are heathens.’ No, we are worshiping Kṛṣṇa personally. Kṛṣṇa has kindly assumed this form because we cannot see the gigantic Kṛṣṇa or how Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. Remain twenty-four hours a day in Kṛṣṇa’s service. This is the purpose of installing the Deity.”\nBombaySeptember 15, 1973The day after his arrival, Śrīla Prabhupāda met with Mrs. N.’s solicitors and heard their offers. The situation had begun to look hopeful, and yet the conclusion eluded them. Mrs. N. had become changed by the public reaction to her attempt to demolish the temple. If Prabhupāda would pay the full balance of twelve lakhs of rupees for the land in one payment, she told her lawyer, she would agree. Prabhupāda was agreeable but did not want to arrange to collect his money until he was certain that Mrs. N. was actually serious.\nMr. Asnani, a Bombay lawyer and ISKCON life member, regularly met with Mrs. N., persuading her to cooperate with Prabhupāda. Her lawyers concurred. Yet after Prabhupāda had been in Bombay for several weeks, no meeting with Mrs. N. had taken place. Once Mr. Asnani went to bring Mrs. N. to meet with Prabhupāda, but she was not feeling well. Day after day Mr. Asnani would tell Prabhupāda, “Mrs. N. will come tomorrow.” Prabhupāda became disappointed at the procrastination, and seeing this, his secretaries told Mr. Asnani that although they knew he meant well, they were inclined to have their other lawyers handle the case. Mr. Asnani asked for another forty-eight hours to close the deal and execute the conveyance.\nMrs. N. was at her other home, where she had just recovered from her illness, when Mr. Asnani visited. “Mātājī,” he begged, “my Guru Mahārāja is leaving tomorrow. If you don’t come tonight, the problem with the land will go on another year.” Mrs. N. agreed, and around nine P.M. she and Mr. Asnani arrived at the home of Mr. Bogilal Patel, where Śrīla Prabhupāda was holding a program ofkīrtanaandBhāgavatadiscourses. Prabhupāda was on the roof preparing to lecture, but hearing that Mrs. N. had arrived, he interrupted the meeting and came down to his room to talk with her. They talked briefly, and Prabhupāda excused himself and returned to the roof to lecture.\nAround midnight, he returned to his room again. Mrs. N. was still waiting. She burst into tears and bowed at Prabhupāda’s feet. “I am sorry for everything I’ve done,” she sobbed. “Please forgive me.” She promised to do whatever Prabhupāda wanted.\nPrabhupāda looked at her compassionately and understood her heart. “You are just like my daughter,” he said. “Don’t worry. I will take care of you. I will see to all of your needs for the rest of your life.” And Prabhupāda said he still accepted the very terms she had proposed: that he pay the remaining balance of twelve lakhs plus fifty thousand rupees compensation for the delay.\nPrabhupāda and Mrs. N. had set November 1 as the tentative deadline for the final signing of the conveyance. Shortly after their meeting, Prabhupāda moved from Bogilal Patel’s to the home of Mr. Sethi, where working intensely he tackled the remaining problems – such as getting C. Company to withdraw their claim.\nNext he moved to the home of Mr. C. M. Khatau, just two blocks from Hare Krishna Land, where he lived in a summer cottage, a simple structure with a bamboo frame andchāṭāiwalls. Usually, conveyances had to be signed in the presence of the city registrar at his office downtown, but Mr. Asnani had arranged for the registrar to come to Prabhupāda’s place.\nAt six-thirty in the evening Śrīla Prabhupāda was seated at his low desk between two windows, his back against the wall. Mrs. N. and her lawyers, the registrar, Mr. Asnani, Mr. and Mrs. Sethi, and about eight devotees were present, and the full room grew warm and stuffy. Mrs. N. sat at Prabhupāda’s right as the registrar prepared the papers for signing. Śrīla Prabhupāda sat gravely. The room was silent except for the sound of papers rustling and a pen’s scratching. Preparing and signing the conveyance papers took more than twenty minutes. Prabhupāda paid Mrs. N., who then signed the conveyance. The land was legally ISKCON’s.\nGirirāja:The room was hushed during the signing, and everyone felt as if a momentous event was taking place – just as if two great world powers were signing a treaty. After Mrs. N. signed the document, everyone silently watched the papers being passed. She started to cry. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami quietly asked her why she was crying, and Mrs. N. replied that just that day Mr. Matar had come and told her he had found a buyer for the land for many more lakhs than we were paying. Actually, as we were watching Mrs. N., we were thinking that she must be remembering all the events that had taken place, the wrongs that she had done, the death of her husband. It was very intense, like a combination of months of struggling. So for Prabhupāda, the devotees, and Prabhupāda’s well-wishers, their dreams and desires and efforts over the past many years were being fulfilled.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda asked that the devotees inform the newspapers, and he invited everyone into the hall outside his room for a feast. Mats were rolled out in two lines, and devotees brought leaf plates and placed them in front of everyone. The devotees began serving the various dishes to the two rows of seated guests.\nPrabhupāda was standing. “Now let us start,” he said, as he supervised the serving. The devotees had prepared several courses: rice,dāl,many varieties ofpakorās(such as potato, cauliflower, and eggplant), potatosabjī,wet cauliflowersabjī, papars, barfī, laḍḍus, camcam(a milk sweet), vermicellikhīr, halavā,and a lime drink. It was a festive and happy occasion.\nMrs. Warrier (a tenant on Hare Krishna Land):The devotees were all saying “Jaya!” after the signing, and all of them were very happy. Then Prabhupāda gave a lecture about the Bombay project. He gave an idea to all the people of how it would be all marble. There wouldn’t be a single thing that wasn’t built from marble. Some were asking how it would be possible for everything to be marble, and Prabhupāda explained that it was possible and could be done. He was visualizing the project, and everyone was thrilled to hear the way he was describing it. It would be like one of the seven wonders of the world. People would be attracted from all over to come and see it. It would be a landmark in Bombay. Prabhupāda explained the whole project as if he saw it in his mind’s eye, and he said that after it was constructed it will be more than what we could visualize. It would be fantastic!\nAfter the late feast, when everyone had departed, Prabhupāda returned to his room. Leaning back at his desk, he exclaimed, “It was a good fight!”\nSurely the land was full of potential, but how could he say there had been no problems? “No problems” meant that Śrīla Prabhupāda saw how Kṛṣṇa personally arranged things for His devotees. When he had needed money, it had come, in an amount that ordinarily would have been impossible to collect. And the formidable opposition Kṛṣṇa had removed. Prabhupāda had no organized means of income and little political influence to fight persons like Mr. and Mrs. N., but because he was surrendered to Kṛṣṇa there was no problem. All the problems of the world were created by the nondevotees, who defied the injunctions of the Supreme. “Anyone who is inbhakti-yoga,” Prabhupāda said, “he can understand that all problems are solved. We can practically see.”\nAnd yet he had had to tolerate the problems created by the nondevotees. For almost two years he had struggled to secure the land for Kṛṣṇa’s service. Whether in Bombay or elsewhere, he had had to worry over how to help his inexperienced disciples, who were ill-equipped to handle the ploys of the opposing party. It had been an ordeal, a test of patience, a challenge of courage. But because he had not been bewildered bymāyā,illusion, there had been “no problem.”\nPrabhupāda showed by his example that if one strictly followsbhakti-yoga,one is not touched by the modes of nature, bymāyā.The same transcendental science he constantly taught in his lectures and informal discussions, he also personally demonstrated. He was faithful in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and all his problems had been adjusted. Kṛṣṇa says in theBhagavad-gītāthat if one surrenders to Him, one easily overcomes all problems. The devotee understands that the problems ofmāyācan be overcome by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, by surrendering to the orders of Kṛṣṇa’s representative, the spiritual master.\nNow that the land was ISKCON’s, Prabhupāda could proceed to enact his vision. In attempting to construct buildings and propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he would meet moremāyā-created problems, no doubt, but the greatest struggle had been won. The gorgeous temple of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Rāsavihārī would manifest. In the future, devotees and guests could come to India’s gateway and stay in a first-class hotel at Hare Krishna Land and conveniently imbibe the spiritual atmosphere of the temple. And the devotees, as long as they did not forget Prabhupāda’s example and instruction, could successfully utilize the facility in the spirit of service to Kṛṣṇa. The price Prabhupāda had paid in tolerance and dependence on Kṛṣṇa would never go in vain.\nWhat Śrīla Prabhupāda produced by his tolerance was not only the facilities and the ongoing mission at Hare Krishna Land but a monumental living example of the behavior of asādhu.In theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,Lord Kapiladeva describes thesādhu:\n“The symptoms of asādhuare that he is tolerant, merciful, and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.”\nBecause thesādhu istolerant (titikṣavaḥ), he is undisturbed by the difficulties imposed by material nature. In Prabhupāda’s attempts to secure the Juhu property, he had met with enemies and difficulties, and he had been tolerant. Prabhupāda had sometimes said, “You have to tolerate.”\nAnd asādhuis not only tolerant but merciful (kāruṇikāḥ). When ISKCON’s provisional temple had been attacked by the police, Prabhupāda could have considered it a signal to leave the place and give up trying to help such ingrates by bringing them Kṛṣṇa consciousness –  “Why go to such botheration? What’s the use of trying?” He had already nearly a hundred temples outside of India. If the people of Bombay didn’t like Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then why not go away and leave them to their fate?\nBut no. As a genuinesādhu,Prabhupāda was merciful. Because he had come to deliver the compassionate message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he had to tolerantly give that message to everyone. People were misguided and were living like animals, only for sense gratification, and by the laws ofkarmathey would suffer in their next life. Seeing this unhappy predicament, Prabhupāda had felt moved to help these fallen souls, even if they were unappreciative.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamalso describes asādhuassuhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām:the only desire in his heart is the welfare of all others. Being unbounded by nationalism, he thinks of himself not as Indian or American or even as human being, but as eternal spiritual soul, meant to benefit all living entities.\nAsādhu,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamdescribes, isajāta-śatru,because he never creates enemies. Although envious persons may declare themselves asādhu’senemy, asādhubehaves as the best friend of everyone, trying to bring everyone to Kṛṣṇa. Because Prabhupāda was trying to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, envious persons would continue to oppose him. But as he sublimely showed in Bombay, “What can be done? We have to tolerate.” Thus, even before any foundations were laid for buildings, Prabhupāda had already fully demonstrated all the ornaments of thesādhu.Remaining peaceful (śānta) and dependent on Kṛṣṇa, he had become victorious. And for whoever serves such a great personality,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamstates, the door to liberation is open."

        "chapter_title": "Beginning the Temple of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma",
        "content": "April 1972\nŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA WAS meditating on constructing his Krishna-Balaram Mandir. In April of 1972 he asked his disciple Surabhi, who had drawn the plans for the Bombay center, to execute drawings, basing the design on Indian renaissance architecture. Prabhupāda liked the Govindajī temple, located near the original Govindajī temple constructed by Rūpa Gosvāmī. He liked its open courtyard surrounded by many arches and its front steps leading up to the Deitydarśanaarea. He suggested that some features of the temple be incorporated into his temple. Surabhi, with the assistance of a Vṛndāvana architect, executed the plans, and Prabhupāda approved.\nAlthough Gurudāsa had been careful to keep in touch with Prabhupāda by mail, he had neglected certain important matters in Vṛndāvana, such as digging a well and getting city approval – things Prabhupāda had repeatedly asked for. In the summer of 1972 Prabhupāda wrote,\nTwo weeks later Prabhupāda again wrote Gurudāsa on the same point.\nTo build a temple in Vṛndāvana should not be so difficult, Prabhupāda thought, and he became impatient with the delays. Concerned that the devotees and architects not make the building too costly, he said that they should go ahead with the plans he had approved, even if the building were to be a little cheaper than in the original plan. He was concerned that a competent disciple oversee the work so that ISKCON didn’t get cheated.\nAs early as April of 1972, Prabhupāda had asked that the Deities in Vṛndāvana be Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. “Kṛṣṇa may be black, Balarāma of white, and the pose in the back of theBack to Godheadmagazine is very nice.” He asked that a sign be put out front announcing, “Shri Krishna Balaram Mandir.”\nOne reason Prabhupāda chose Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma as the presiding Deities was that most of the Vṛndāvana temples were of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa; ISKCON’s temple would be unique in Vṛndāvana. Another reason was that the ISKCON land was located in Ramaṇa-reti, an area of forest and soft sands where Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma had enjoyed Their childhood pastimes five thousand years ago. To celebrate and worship the youthful sports of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in Ramaṇa-reti was fitting.\nAlthough thousands of years had passed since Kṛṣṇa’s advent in Vṛndāvana, the same atmosphere and many of the same sights and sounds still prevailed. Peacocks ran across the sands or sat on rooftops or in trees. The cooing and chirping of pigeons and cuckoos and the sweep of the parrots’ green wings were eternal sounds and sights of the Vṛndāvana forest. InKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of GodheadPrabhupāda had described how Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma and Their cowherd friends played in Ramaṇa-reti and similar places.\nAccording toŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,the playing of the cowherd boys with Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma as friends in Vṛndāvana is the highest spiritual realization, far beyond the ordinary religionist’s understanding of God. The Supreme Truth, whom some meditated upon as impersonal Brahman, others worshiped as the Supreme Almighty, and still others considered an ordinary living entity, was the eternal, loving friend of the cowherd boys of Vṛndāvana. Only after many, many lifetimes of pious activities had they become eligible to join in the loving pastimes of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in Ramaṇa-reti.\nIn establishing a temple of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, Prabhupāda wanted to offer the peaceful, transcendental atmosphere of Ramaṇa-reti to all people, including visitors from abroad, commuters from Delhi, and his own disciples. Already he had received a letter from a major international travel agency requesting that he provide accommodations for tourists so that the ISKCON guesthouse could be included in official tours of spiritual India. People were always coming to India to tour the holy places; unfortunately most of the places were unauthorized or overrun by cheaters. ISKCON’s center, therefore, would be very important. Prabhupāda wrote,\nThere was another particular significance in Prabhupāda’s choosing Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma as the central object of worship in his Vṛndāvana temple. Lord Balarāma is the first expansion from Lord Kṛṣṇa, and in His incarnation of Saṅkarṣaṇa, He upholds all the universes. The Vaiṣṇavas, therefore, worship Balarāma for spiritual strength. “You can pray to Lord Balarāma,” Prabhupāda said, “to help you in your deficiency.” As the source of spiritual strength, Lord Balarāma is also known as the original spiritual master.\nAs in Prabhupāda’s other large ISKCON temples, there would be three altars, and beside Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma would stand the Deities of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda. Lord Caitanya is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and Lord Nityānanda is Lord Balarāma, a fact the Krishna-Balaram Mandir would proclaim to the world. Lord Nityānanda is especially referred to as thekṛpā-avatāra,the form of God most merciful to the fallen conditioned souls. Thus the worship of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma as Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda would emphasize distributing Kṛṣṇa consciousness to others. Prabhupāda also wanted to install Deities of Rādhā-Śyāmasundara along with Their two attendantgopīs,Lalitā and Viśākhā.\nSince Prabhupāda did not trust his devotees’ spending habits, he arranged for a complicated system whereby he would have to approve all ISKCON Vṛndāvana checks, even while traveling. When Gurudāsa wanted to spend, Tejās, the Delhi temple president, would come to Vṛndāvana and approve the expenses. Then a check would be made out and mailed to Śrīla Prabhupāda for his signature. When the check returned to Delhi, Tejās would add his own signature and give the check to Gurudāsa.\nAlthough Prabhupāda generally preferred not to burden himself with managing his temples, he insisted on supervising all spending in Vṛndāvana, down to the last rupee. But even with such controls, Gurudāsa would misspend money, taking funds earmarked for construction and using them for other temple purposes – usually getting cheated by the merchants.\nAfter Prabhupāda’s 1972 visit during Kārttika, he was away from Vṛndāvana for an entire year, directing things through correspondence. With the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement growing quickly on all continents, he had many places to visit. Still, his three main projects – Bombay, Vṛndāvana, and Māyāpur – were his major subjects of correspondence and his greatest financial investments.\nOne reason he did not come more often to Vṛndāvana was that Gurudāsa’s letters had been very optimistic, promising a temple opening by Janmāṣṭamī 1973. Surabhi was in charge of the construction and knew well that the work was going too slowly, yet Gurudāsa would write to Prabhupāda, painting a picture of imminent completion of the construction and opening of themandira.Prabhupāda was enlivened to hear the good news, and he held Gurudāsa to his promise, though with reservations.\nPrabhupāda warned the devotees in Vṛndāvana that they would have to work diligently, finishing before the monsoon season arrived in June if they were actually to fulfill their promise.\nBut anyone visiting the construction site in Vṛndāvana could understand that the building would never be finished in time. The temple area consisted of foundation lines and steel rods. Only three or four devotees were living there, struggling to organize laborers and to obtain funds and building materials. That summer was extremely hot, and each day the devotees were forced to spend the afternoon lying down in their huts, exhausted from the heat. Prices for cement and steel had doubled. Yet Prabhupāda continued to respond to Gurudāsa’s glowing reports, encouraging him to continue with determination.\nBut Prabhupāda could also read between the lines, and he cautioned Gurudāsa, “I simply want to see that the work is being carried on vigorously, and the money shall not be used to pay bad bills. The money should simply be used for construction.” Talk of a temple opening by Janmāṣṭamī gradually disappeared, but Prabhupāda did not express his disappointment. Rather, he continued to encourage and push the devotees onward, asking that at least his own room be completed, so that when he visited in October of 1973, he would have a place to stay.\nWhen Prabhupāda arrived, however, his quarters were far from completion, and he had to live for a week in the home of a Vṛndāvana friend. He did not remove Gurudāsa, but he tried to teach him better management and accounting. He also wrote to his India G.B.C. secretary, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, to get more funds for the Vṛndāvana project.\nInspired by Prabhupāda’s presence, the devotees rallied. They held a little festival on the land, erecting a tent and decorating the foundation posts with banana trees and flowers. For several evenings Prabhupāda lectured before a crowd of about fifty local people sitting on folding chairs in between the foundation lines.\nPrabhupāda was determined in his desire. He wanted a temple as much as ever, and the small band of disciples in Vṛndāvana were convinced of their mission to erect that temple. They knew they were building a temple not merely as their own local project but as something very important for the whole world. Prabhupāda set the next Janmāṣṭamī, August 1974, as the new grand opening.\nSurabhi had considerable architectural and construction experience, but he had never worked with such an ornate building before. He doubted, therefore, whether they could finish in a year’s time. Tejās wondered whether they could raise the funds in time. Gurudāsa was becoming more competent, and he assured Prabhupāda that they would meet their deadline.\nSubala had wanted to stay in Vṛndāvana, but only on the condition that he be relieved of management, free to chant and wander in the groves. But he had long since departed for the West. Those devotees who remained committed to Vṛndāvana knew that, at least for the present, the real spiritual path in Vṛndāvana was one of hard labor, anxiety, combating the elements, and working as pure instruments in the service of Kṛṣṇa’s pure devotee.\nAt that time Prabhupāda’s house had no roof or floor, and only portions of the outer walls. Surabhi began a marathon construction effort and hired two work crews, one for day and one for night. Two weeks nonstop they worked, drastically cutting corners. They plastered and painted simultaneously, and as a result the walls remained wet. A few days before Prabhupāda’s arrival they put down a temporary floor: bricks, covered with cow dung, covered with rugs, covered with sheets. The weather was cold, and the house had no heating.\nThe morning Prabhupāda arrived, the devotees all gathered with him as he sat happily before his desk, praising their achievement. He said if they could keep working like this, they could finish everything before Janmāṣṭamī.\nAlmost immediately upon his arrival Prabhupāda began to manifest the symptoms of a cold, but he would not hear of moving to another place. “This is my first house,” he said. “Now I am going to stay here.”\nThe large brick-and-stone room was simple and austere and remained dark during most of the day, but Prabhupāda considered it his Vṛndāvana residence. Soon local distinguished visitors began calling on him, and he received them warmly, discussing Kṛṣṇa consciousness hour after hour in his room. In the evenings he would lecture there and hold akīrtana.\nOn further inquiry Prabhupāda learned that Gurudāsa had not yet received the actual deed. Prabhupāda was greatly disturbed, yet he proceeded calmly and intently. Gurudāsa, he said, should immediately secure the deed from the registrar and construct a high brick wall around the property. Prabhupāda’s secretary wired Mr. S., who was away from Vṛndāvana: “HARE KRSNA. PRABHUPADA NOW IN VRINDABAN UNTIL THE 13TH. NOW SETTLE UP FRONT PIECE AS PROMISED.”\nMr. S. wired his reply: “FRONT PART OF LAND WILL BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS DECIDED EARLIER. LETTER FOLLOWS.” Suddenly it seemed that Prabhupāda had another Bombay case on his hands.\nMr. S.’s action, however, confirmed Prabhupāda’s urgency for completing the construction. Had the land been already walled and the temple built, there would have been no question of Mr. S.’s taking the land back. Prabhupāda’s followers could now see clearly his reasons for pushing them. He had been vigilant, even heavy and critical, but for good reasons.Māyā’sopposition to Kṛṣṇa consciousness was always present, so that if the devotees let up for even a moment, they could suffer great losses. The question “Why hurry? Why be so anxious to build a temple right away?” should never have been asked. It was the question of the naive, the lazy. As long as the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement had no temple in Vṛndāvana, the threat would exist that there mightneverbe a temple.\nPrabhupāda wrote to a friend in Calcutta,\nIn Mr. S.’s absence from Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda took the opportunity to speak with Mr. S.’s brothers as well as with Mr. S.’s lawyers. What had been given in the name of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, he informed them, could not be taken back. Mr. S.’s associates agreed, at least for the moment, that Mr. S. had no substantial position. Meanwhile, the laborers were working quickly to build a twelve-foot-high wall around the property.\nOn the other side of the double doors sat his servant, peeking in to see what his spiritual master was doing. On Prabhupāda’s last visit to the United States, he had acquired a new secretary-servant, Satsvarūpa dāsa Goswami. Despite the cold, Prabhupāda’s new assistant was happy to be in Vṛndāvana and so intimately situated close to his spiritual master.\nPrabhupāda rang his bell. The servant jumped up, opened the double doors, and entered the room. In the far corner of the large room, seated at the desk, he saw Prabhupāda, looking grave and mystical, his beautifully intense eyes sparkling. As Satsvarūpa offered obeisances, he thought of his great fortune in being there with his spiritual master. When he sat up, he saw Prabhupāda nod slightly, and he felt that Prabhupāda was acknowledging his servant’s good fortune.\nSitting on the floor on the other side of the desk, Satsvarūpa faced Śrīla Prabhupāda. In awe and reverence he tensed, prepared to do whatever Prabhupāda requested, yet fearful that the request might be something he wouldn’t know how to do.\n“Get theKṛṣṇabook, Volume Two,” Prabhupāda said. His servant ran and got it from the shelf, returned, and again sat down.\n“Read the story of King Nṛga,” Prabhupāda said. Though terse, Prabhupāda’s commands were complete. His servant paused, wondering if there was anything else. He opened the book, then hesitated. “Out loud?” he asked. Prabhupāda nodded, and his servant began to read aloud.\nSoon, however, Satsvarūpa became puzzled as to why Prabhupāda was having him do this so early in the morning when he was usually dictatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.As Satsvarūpa read aloud, Prabhupāda sat motionless, giving no indication that he was pleased, or even listening. In that silence, Satsvarūpa became very aware of his own voice reading, and he listened intently to the story.\nKing Nṛga, the story explained, gave many cows in charity to thebrāhmaṇas.One day, however, one cow wandered back and entered among King Nṛga’s herd, and so the king unknowingly gave it in charity to anotherbrāhmaṇa.But as the new owner was leading the cow away, the former owner returned to claim it. An argument ensued between the twobrāhmaṇas.Coming before King Nṛga, they charged that he had taken back a cow previously given in charity – a great sin. The puzzled King Nṛga very humbly offered eachbrāhmaṇaone hundred thousand cows in exchange for this one cow. Neither accepted, however, since according to Manu’s law, abrāhmaṇa’sproperty can’t be taken under any condition, even by the government. Consequently, bothbrāhmaṇasleft in anger, and as a result King Nṛga had to take his next birth as a lizard.\nAs Prabhupāda’s servant read on, he suddenly got the feeling that Prabhupāda had asked him to read this story to expose the cheating of his own servant. In a panic, he tried to think of how he had committed the offense of stealing from his spiritual master. He couldn’t think of anything wrong – until he recalled having taken a pair of socks which had been given to Prabhupāda as a gift. Prabhupāda was always receiving gifts wherever he went, and it was his practice, after collecting socks and scarves and so on, to give them to his disciples. Prabhupāda would use only a fraction of the things given to him. So because it was cold in Vṛndāvana, Satsvarūpa, who had no socks, had taken one inexpensive-looking pair that he was sure his spiritual master would never want to use. He had assumed that Prabhupāda would not object, but now his cheating was indirectly exposed.\nAfter the story was completed, Prabhupāda remained silent, as did his servant. “Perhaps Prabhupāda is sleeping,” Satsvarūpa thought, though he dared not say anything or even move. They both sat motionless, Satsvarūpa looking down at the book and sometimes up at Prabhupāda, waiting for an indication.\nFive minutes passed. Finally Prabhupāda said, “Now take this chapter and type it up.” His servant acknowledged the instruction and got up to leave. But still it wasn’t clear. Why had he read the story, and why type it? Prabhupāda then spoke again. “Now I want to dictate one letter.” Satsvarūpa had a notepad with him, and he sat down and immediately began writing Prabhupāda’s words.\nThe letter was to Mr. S., and Prabhupāda referred to Mr. S.’s donation of the land and to his desire to take back the front fifty feet. He reminded Mr. S. that, according to the original agreement, he had given the entire land with the sanction of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. How could he say that now he was taking it back? Mr. S. should please reconsider what he was proposing. In this connection Prabhupāda was enclosing the story fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamof King Nṛga. Mr. S. should read it and consider the implications.\nPrabhupāda’s servant felt relieved. But he also felt that his guilt was valid and that he should be wary of becoming too familiar with his spiritual master’s possessions. And he had learned another lesson as well: his own viewpoint of Prabhupāda was entirely subjective. Although he had been with Prabhupāda, he had not correctly understood Prabhupāda’s thoughts and motives. He felt that perhaps he was not the only disciple who sometimes made that mistake. One may try to comprehend the many aspects of Śrīla Prabhupāda, but one should not expect to understand completely. Even G.B.C. secretaries and other leading devotees who were right with Prabhupāda in his dealings could not know what Prabhupāda was thinking. Satsvarūpa Mahārāja decided that it was best to always follow Śrīla Prabhupāda’s instructions, and going back to the adjoining room, he began typing the story of King Nṛga.\nPrabhupāda reached the Chhatikara road in front of the property and began walking down the middle of the road in the direction of Delhi. Largenīmtrees lined the road. “The material side of life is also necessary,” Prabhupāda continued. “In the West, even for shaving they have a machine. This is very good, but it is also being misused. It is all for the itching sensation, sex, which is insignificant and abominable. The whole intelligence is being employed like the dog’s or cat’s.”\nPrabhupāda paused, and a devotee asked, “Prabhupāda, how can we understand that Vṛndāvana is Kṛṣṇa’s abode? There seems to be so much contamination in Vṛndāvana.”\n“This is because your senses are impure,” said Prabhupāda. “But when your eyes are smeared with the salve of love, then you can see Vṛndāvana. Don’t judge Vṛndāvana by this external manifestation.”\nAs Prabhupāda walked along the road, many persons greeted him and his disciples, calling, “JayaRādhe!” “Hare Kṛṣṇa!” Some even stepped out of their shoes and prostrated themselves before Prabhupāda, who returned their respects with folded palms, nodding his head, and saying, “Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nThe tightly gathered group walking in the cold morning air passed fields,āśramas,and groves. They heard the singing of many varieties of birds: sparrows, parrots, cuckoos, pigeons, and peacocks. Sugarcane stood high and ready for harvest. As Prabhupāda walked farther, the largenīmtrees gave way to small thorny acacia trees, and herds of cows and buffalo grazed in the fields. For half an hour Prabhupāda continued. Then, turning, he retraced his route.\nOn the roadside he passed a man dressed in the simple white cloth of abābājī,warming himself before a fire of twigs. Prabhupāda said that theṢaḍ-gosvāmy-aṣṭakam,by Śrīnivāsa Ācārya, defines the actual qualities of a person in the renounced order. The song glorifies the six Gosvāmīs, who gave up their posts as government ministers and became mendicants, accepting only one cloth and thinking always of Kṛṣṇa and thegopīs.\n“Vṛndāvana is the gift of Rūpa and Sanātana Gosvāmī,” Prabhupāda said. “They wrote many books so poor people could take advantage and become Kṛṣṇa conscious. We see many imitations of Rūpa Gosvāmī in Vṛndāvana today. But they should never take the dress of Rūpa Gosvāmī, especially if they cannot give up this cigarette-smoking habit. It was the gift of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī that we should not jump and try to change our garb all of a sudden. We should try to hear of the Absolute Truth from realized souls.” Prabhupāda said that especially his disciples living in Vṛndāvana should becomegosvāmīs.Whethergṛhasthasorsannyāsīs,they should live simply and austerely and engage twenty-four hours in the service of Kṛṣṇa.\n“I am keeping duplicates, Prabhupāda,” Guṇārṇava explained, showing him how he had attached the bills to the vouchers. “Tejās is keeping the originals in Delhi.”\n“This is just an explanation,” Prabhupāda replied. “I am an auditor. I am not A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. Don’t you understand? The auditor wants to see the bills, not just your excuses.”\nThroughout the day, Prabhupāda would call in Gurudāsa, Surabhi, Mr. Lahadi (the engineer), even the contractor, Mr. Alibuchs. Although the contractor was Muhammadan, Prabhupāda requested him, “Please do a nice job, because this is Kṛṣṇa’s temple. If you work very nicely, Kṛṣṇa will bless you.” Prabhupāda assured him that money would not be a problem. He would arrange that ten thousand dollars a month would come from his temples in America until the construction was finished.\n“It will be finished by Janmāṣṭamī?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“Yes,” Gurudāsa said firmly. “It will be done.”\nMāyāpurMarch 1974While traveling from Calcutta to Māyāpur, Prabhupāda stopped as usual at the pleasant, secluded mango grove and, sitting on a straw mat, took a breakfast of fresh fruits. A group of his disciples and his sister, Bhavatāriṇī, were also present, and Prabhupāda saw that everyone receivedprasādam.He then returned to his car, and the caravan continued to Māyāpur.\nPrabhupāda smiled. Looking out from the back seat of the car, he recognized many faithful disciples, all hankering for his merciful glance of recognition. The car, surrounded tightly by devotees, inched its way through the gates and up the long drive to the temple. Along the roadside and around the temple buildings, colorful marigolds andtagarwere abloom, enhancing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s joyous reception.\nThe temple room was completed, its sparkling marble floor, freshly painted walls, and crystal chandeliers all having been readied just a few days before. After offering obeisances before the resplendent golden forms of Rādhā-Mādhava on the altar, Prabhupāda turned and walked the long temple hall to sit on hisvyāsāsanaand address this first truly international gathering of disciples. He welcomed them to Māyāpur, acknowledging that on this day, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s prediction had come true. The devotees shouted triumphantly, “Jaya!Jaya,Śrīla Prabhupāda!”\nBhaktivinoda Ṭhākura had written,\nBhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s prophecy had come to pass. He had also predicted, “Soon a great saint will come and establish Lord Caitanya’s movement throughout the world.” That great personality – empowered to create devotees of all races and backgrounds and to rally them together in Māyāpur, thousands of miles from their homes – was Śrīla Prabhupāda. And although he saw himself as an instrument of theācāryas,his disciples saw him as the personification of Lord Caitanya’s and Lord Nityānanda’s mercy. As stated in theCaitanya-caritāmṛta, yadyapi āmāra guru – caitanyera dāsa/ tathāpi jāniye āmi tāṅhāra prakāśa:“Although I know that my spiritual master is a servitor of Śrī Caitanya, I know him also as a plenary manifestation of the Lord.”\nLeaving the temple room, Prabhupāda went upstairs and retired to his room, satisfied that the building was now fulfilling its purpose by giving shelter to hundreds of his spiritual children. He began greeting leading disciples from various parts of the world, hearing the encouraging news of book distribution and dealing with problems. He asked that everyone take advantage of the holydhāmaby maintainingkīrtanain the temple room around the clock, stopping only for scheduled classes onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nThe devotees were very happy to be together in thedhāma.Those with experience of India, like Jayapatāka Swami and Acyutānanda Swami, led groups of devotees onparikrama(pilgrimage) to local holy places. This visit to Māyāpur would constitute the first half of the devotees’ Indian pilgrimage; after ten days they were scheduled to go to Vṛndāvana.\nAlmost all of the devotees assembled in Māyāpur preached in areas of the world where the modes of ignorance and passion predominated. Daily they had to mix with materialistic people, and it was inevitable that they would become worn down. This pilgrimage, therefore, was a chance for purification. Although they were not advanced in birth or in knowledge of the SanskritVedas,Prabhupāda had accepted them, and that was their certification as devotees. They were bona fide candidates for understanding the meaning of thedhāma.They would become refreshed by bathing in the Ganges in Māyāpur and the Yamunā in Vṛndāvana, and they would return to their respective centers throughout the world, purified and renewed for more active preaching.\nOne song by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura described the pilgrims’ eligibility to realize thedhāma:\nThe devotees’ main reason for coming to Māyāpur, however, was to associate with Śrīla Prabhupāda. He was always traveling, and his disciples could only expect to see him briefly from time to time as he passed through their area. To see him in Māyāpur and Vṛndāvana, where they could be with him daily on walks and in the temple, was the most ecstatic part of the festival.\nPrabhupāda’s happiness to be in Māyāpur was increased many times by the large gathering of his international family. He wanted this. Māyāpur was for the devotees. Prabhupāda even thought that, if possible, all the devotees should stay here permanently and simply go on chanting, although he admitted that it was not practical in terms of world preaching. He derived great satisfaction from sitting in his room above the temple hall and hearing the constant rousingkīrtanas.“Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said,” he remarked, “there is nothing of value in all the fourteen worlds except the chanting of the holy names.”\nAt Prabhupāda’s request, his Governing Body Commission members had gathered in Māyāpur. Their purpose was to discuss ISKCON’s preaching activities around the world and then to pass resolutions to direct that preaching. This was the first time they had met as a body in Prabhupāda’s presence, and he instructed them how to conduct their meeting. They should not simply talk, he said. Rather, someone should present a proposal, which should then be discussed and voted on. All resolutions should be listed in the minutes.\n“Chalk out your plans for the year,” Prabhupāda said. “And then whatever you decide, do not change it, but carry it out. Then next year you can meet and discuss again.” He was not in favor of prolonged meetings, but he was satisfied to see his G.B.C. secretaries seriously confronting all items on the agenda for the sake of a growing Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nKṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja describes Navadvīpa-dhāma as the place where Lord Caitanya had planted the seed of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness “tree.” In one verse he states, “Thus the branches of the Caitanya tree formed a cluster of society, with great branches covering all the universe.” And Śrīla Prabhupāda had written a conclusive one-sentence purport to this verse: “Our International Society for Krishna Consciousness is one of the branches of the Caitanya tree.”\nPrabhupāda’sCaitanya-caritāmṛtatranslation and commentary was the fruit of the Caitanya tree. It was fully authoritative andparamparā,but never merely academic or technical. Its teachings stressed that Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s desire to widely distribute devotional service should be the desire of everyone. It left no doubt about what Prabhupāda expected from the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nThis volume also contained one of the most important verses of theCaitanya-caritāmṛta: bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra / janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upākara,“One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all people.” In his purport to this verse, Prabhupāda explained the special piety of the Indians, who were always ready to take part in asaṅkīrtanafestival. Unfortunately, the present leaders of India were leading the people away from God, away from distinguishing pious and sinful acts, and away from belief in a next life. The Indians had the special duty of educating the world in Vedic principles.\n“If all Indians had taken to this path as advised by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu,” Prabhupāda wrote, “India would have given a unique gift to the world, and thus India would have been glorified.” Moreover, it was not only the duty of the Indians but the duty of everyone to help the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement: “One should know definitely that the best welfare activity for all of human society is to awaken man’s God consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nPrabhupāda stayed with his disciples in Māyāpur for a full week, lecturing daily and meeting with smaller groups for many hours. On the day of Gaura-pūrṇimā he went down to the Ganges and took the sacred water on his head, while his men dove off the high bank and swam. The next day he left for Vṛndāvana, where he would again meet his disciples and introduce them to thedhāma.\nAlthough many of the Western devotees, inexperienced in living and traveling in India, were afflicted with indigestion, dysentery, and even, in some cases, culture shock and homesickness, they nevertheless traveled, a somewhat bedraggled group, from Māyāpur to Calcutta to Delhi, and finally to Vṛndāvana.\nSince the Vṛndāvana temple and guesthouse was still mostly a construction site, the devotees had to stay at the nearby Fogel Ashram, while Prabhupāda again took up residence in his newly constructed rooms near the site of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir. The devotees would see him regularly on morning walks and during the morningBhāgavatamclass, and he would also come in the evening sometimes to speak under an outdoor pavilion at Fogel Ashram.\nNoticing that not many devotees attended his first evening meeting in his room, Prabhupāda inquired and learned that many of them were out visiting Vṛndāvana’s famous old temples and other pilgrimage sites, while others were shopping in the bazaar, and still others were sleeping. “Bring them all back,” Prabhupāda said, annoyed. “Coming to pilgrimage means to come where thesādhusare. I am here, so why is everyone going elsewhere?” On hearing this, so many devotees came to Prabhupāda’s room that they could not all fit.\nPrabhupāda began talking abouttapasya,austerity. “Thetapasvīsin Vṛndāvana go naked,” he said, “even in the cold. They are determined not to take birth again for material life.” He described how the living entity before birth remains cramped within the womb, a condition much like being tied by the hands and feet and thrown in the ocean. Worms within the mother’s body bite the skin of the embryo, and the living entity suffers. Becausemāyādeludes us into thinking we are happy, Prabhupāda explained, we have to again enter the womb of a mother. And although in one lifetime we may be a wealthy human being, in the next life we may be a bug or hog or dog.\n“So this life is fortapasya,”Prabhupāda said. “But we cannot execute severe penances in this age. So our penance is to try to reform poor crazy persons. One should take voluntary pains for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa comes to save the fallen souls, so if you help a little, He will be pleased. Kṛṣṇa comes Himself and He sends His devotee and He leaves books, and still we are mad for sense enjoyment. Our penance, therefore, is to try to reform the fallen souls.”\nPrabhupāda’s preaching uplifted his disciples, whose duty was to preach to the citizens of many lands. They had come, at Prabhupāda’s bidding, to visit Māyāpur and Vṛndāvana, but their real work was to save the fallen souls of their native countries, and Prabhupāda’s preaching filled them with determination.\nLater, one of the devotees told Prabhupāda that dealing with the devotees was sometimes more difficult than dealing with the materialists, and he mentioned a well-known problem case, a devotee named Makhana-cora. “That is your penance,” Prabhupāda said. “Your penance is to work with Makhana-cora. We should take anxiety. For a sane man to work with a crazy man is not pleasurable, but the service to Kṛṣṇa is pleasurable.” Prabhupāda described how he had left his peaceful life in Vṛndāvana to take on so much burden and anxiety for Kṛṣṇa. Just as he had taken a risk by going to America in old age, so his disciples should accept whatever difficulties were required in preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. “The work is not pleasurable,” Prabhupāda said, “but making so many devotees is pleasurable.”\nAlthough the devotees had been visiting the various temples of Vṛndāvana, eager to imbibe the Vṛndāvana spirit, the real nectar came when Prabhupāda, sitting in his room, spoke about Vṛndāvana. “Vṛndāvana is forparamahaṁsas,” he said. “You cannot see Vṛndāvana withviṣaya,or material spirit. The test is how much you have conquered over eating, sleeping, and mating. Don’t think you can just come to Vṛndāvana and become agosvāmī.One who comes to Vṛndāvana with a material spirit will take birth as a dog or a monkey in Vṛndāvana. That is his punishment. But the dogs here are also Vaiṣṇavas.\n“People come to Vṛndāvana to give up all material anxieties and family life. So one should not be afraid. He should never mind what is going to happen. There are many devotees in Vṛndāvana who are not disturbed by heat or cold. But another risk in Vṛndāvana is to meet those who talk of thegopīsbut are not free from smokingbiḍis.They aresahajiyās.We have to see who is a devotee by his personal behavior. If one is seeking money andbiḍisand women and talking of thegopīs,then what is his position? Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never talked of thegopīspublicly. The real Vṛndāvana is not to eatprasādamand sleep but to follow the advice of Vṛndāvana-candra [Kṛṣṇa] and broadcast His message. That is His message. That is Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana-dhāma is worshipable. Don’t commit an offense here. Take it ascintāmaṇi-dhāma,Kṛṣṇa. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says to see Vṛndāvana is not possible withviṣaya.So we should take the shelter of Gaura-Nitāi, become cleansed of eating, sleeping, and mating. Then you will see Vṛndāvana. Don’t commit offenses here. There is a special influence in Vṛndāvana.”\nPrabhupāda said that Vṛndāvana’s spiritual quality was such that devotional service performed here had one hundred times the effect of service performed elsewhere. But an offense in Vṛndāvana also had one hundred times the effect. Ordinary persons, therefore, were advised to visit a holy place like Vṛndāvana for no more than three days; otherwise they would become slack and return to their sinful activities. “Better to come,” Prabhupāda said, “become purified, and leave on the fourth day. And the worst offense to Vṛndāvana is to commit illicit sex here. So do not come and play hide-and-seek with Kṛṣṇa. He sees with His eyes, the sun, and He is also in your heart. Kṛṣṇa knows everything. Those who want to be devotees have to be sincere. They shouldn’t play tricks, because Kṛṣṇa knows everything. Be sincere with Kṛṣṇa and His representative. Preach the gospel ofBhagavad-gītāas it is. Become a spiritual master.”\nAfter his evening lecture, Prabhupāda mentioned how some of thesahajiyāshad walked out during his lecture. “They are so advanced,” he said, “that they want to hear only of the embracing and kissing of Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa. They take my talks as ordinary.” Prabhupāda explained that his process of lecturing was to speak on only one verse per lecture, but that that speaking was the same as Kṛṣṇa’s speaking. He said that his own Guru Mahārāja had lectured for three months on the first verse ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and for that he had gained great respect.\nThe boy replied, “Thebābājīshave given me some facility to chant.”\n“You come with me!” Prabhupāda exclaimed. “I will give you facility. But don’t become a monkey.” The boy surrendered before Prabhupāda’s compassionate concern.\n“You may be afraid of your spiritual master,” Prabhupāda said, “but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t come and see him.” He then narrated the story of how Lord Balarāma had once forced the River Yamunā to come before Him. As he spoke, all the devotees present became aware that Prabhupāda was not only telling thelīlāof Lord Balarāma’s frightening the River Yamunā, but he was also speaking indirectly about his disciple Yamunā. Absorbed in the pastimes of Lord Balarāma, Prabhupāda described how the Lord, intoxicated from drinking honey, had threatened the River Yamunā, forcing her to come. But when the Yamunā did not come, Lord Balarāma had cut into the earth with His plow, forcing her to flow to Him. “In this way,” Prabhupāda said, “I will drag you to come and see me.” Yamunā dāsī agreed to stop her foolish reluctance and come and cook for her spiritual master.\nSome of the devotees had expected that in Vṛndāvana Prabhupāda would talk more about the places of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes and about Kṛṣṇa and thegopīsand that Prabhupāda himself would want to see the places of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. But Prabhupāda seemed far more concerned to hear of the preaching of his disciples or to discuss the construction of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir. Often when devotees raised the topic of Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda would criticize the cheating of certain Vṛndāvanabābājīsand the corruption within Vṛndāvana. Or he would speak of the special vision required before one could properly see Vṛndāvana. He said Vṛndāvana was wherever a pure devotee lived. And he stressed that the devotees’ main business was to go out of Vṛndāvana and preach.\nAs they walked along the road, the main traffic was pedestrians, workers carrying milk on bicycles, or men riding on bullock carts; only occasionally an automobile would speed by, its horn honking. Almost every person who approached would respectfully greet Prabhupāda with “JayaRādhe!” or “Hare Kṛṣṇa!” Or they would hold up their hands or bow their heads and saynamas te.One young man driving a bicycle ricksha approached from the opposite direction and, just before reaching Prabhupāda, stopped his ricksha, got down, stepped out of his shoes, and prostrated himself on the road. Prabhupāda smiled and said, “Very good boy.”\nPrabhupāda paused. “This is Vṛndāvana,” he said. The simple habit of the ordinary people in Vṛndāvana to offer respect to a saintly person was, to Prabhupāda, an expression of Vṛndāvana’s essence. Vṛndāvana was one of the few remaining places in India where even a common man would chant the name of Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa as he passed by on the road. To fully understand this extraordinary phenomenon was to understand Vṛndāvana.\nOne devotee asked Prabhupāda that if so many residents of Vṛndāvana were fallen souls, then what was the meaning of the statement that to be born in Vṛndāvana was to be liberated? “It says in theKṛṣṇabook,” the devotee said, “that the people in Vṛndāvana don’t need a spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa is their spiritual master.”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied, “they have an excellent spiritual master. But one may have a spiritual master and not obey him. Then what is his position? So they are fallen who do nonsense things in Vṛndāvana. But their fortune is also there – that they are born in Vṛndāvana. But they misuse that fortune.”\nThe land was very dry. Prabhupāda said that Vṛndāvana was becoming like a desert and would become more so in the future. He said this was because of impiety. “In the West,” he said, “I see in America, Germany, there is so much green. But not here.”\nThe devotees then questioned Prabhupāda. “Wasn’t the West more impious than Vṛndāvana?”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said. “I came to you in the West, and you did not know anything about Kṛṣṇa. You did not even know that these things were bad – meat-eating and illicit sex. But when I told you to stop, you did it. But this is Kṛṣṇa’s land, Vṛndāvana, and they are doing these things here. Therefore it is even worse. And they are being punished directly by Kṛṣṇa.”\nPrabhupāda’s morning walks in Vṛndāvana were as exciting and enlightening as his formal lectures. On two consecutive morning walks, he outlined a comprehensive plan for starting an ISKCONvarṇāśramacollege.Bhagavad-gītāexplains how society should be divided into four orders, according to a person’s nature and occupation. Prabhupāda said that although the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement were above the social divisions –brāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,andśūdra –they should teach others by acting perfectly within these divisions. Not everyone would become abrāhmaṇa,but everyone could attain the same perfection by doing his particular duty – for the pleasure of Kṛṣṇa. “We will teach military art,” said Prabhupāda, to the amazement of his disciples. “Soldiers will weartilakaand march, saying, ‘Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa.’ They can march with military band and fight.”\nTo Prabhupāda, establishingvarṇāśrama-dharmadid not seem difficult. ISKCON should begin by starting a college based on thevarṇāśramaconception. “There should be no unemployment,” Prabhupāda said. “We will say, ‘Why are you sitting idly? Come onto the field. Take this plow. Take this bull. Go on working. Why are you sitting idly?’ This is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Nobody should be allowed to sit down and sleep. They must find out some employment. Either work as abrāhmaṇa,or as akṣatriya,or as avaiśya.Why should there be unemployment?\n“Just as this body is working – that means the leg is working, the hand, the brain, the belly. So why should there be unemployment? You stop this unemployment – you will see the whole world is peaceful. There will be no complaint. They will be happily chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Just like this field here. No one is working it. They have all gone to the cities to work in the factory. It is a condemned civilization.”\nOn a morning walk near the end of the Vṛndāvana festival one of the devotees mentioned that the festival was almost over and that the devotees would be going back to their centers. “Yes,” said Prabhupāda, and he stopped walking. “Yes, that is our real business – to go and preach.”\nThe report from Girirāja deeply disturbed Śrīla Prabhupāda. “You should immediately object,” he told Girirāja on his walk the next morning, “that the government is completely unqualified. The pure devotees are always engaged inkīrtana,and the government calls it a nuisance. He could at least be a gentleman and say that the sound should not be amplified while people are trying to take rest. But instead he has said thekīrtanaissimply a nuisance.” Prabhupāda said that there were many learned persons in Bombay, and they also would not stand for this judgment.\n“You have to organize all the Vaiṣṇavas,” Prabhupāda continued. “In theBhagavad-gītāit is said,satataṁ kīrtayanto mām:one has to chant ‘Kṛṣṇa’ always. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.And this rascal is saying ‘bhajanais nuisance’? Hmm? Is it not possible to invoke an agitation against this? What right has he got to say ‘nuisance’? He could have spoken in sweet language that, ‘Thebhajanamay be very good for the devotees, but it creates disturbance to the others. Therefore we cannot allow.’ Say like that. But they cannot still stopbhajana.But his remark is that thebhajanais nuisance! Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa is the culture of India. We must make propaganda and organizekīrtanaparties and fight this.”\nOne of the G.B.C. men proposed that instead of going back to the West some of the devotees stay, go to Bombay, and hold massive protests. At first Prabhupāda approved this spirit, likening it to Lord Caitanya’s protest against the Kazi, who had stopped thesaṅkīrtanamovement in Navadvīpa. But on reflecting, he decided it would not be wise to fight with the government. The devotees could not hope to win such a fight, nor would the people appreciate it. Prabhupāda suggested the devotees hold massivekīrtanaprograms and preach positively to the people of Bombay, convincing them of the value of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. “When the people of Bombay are convinced of the importance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness,” Prabhupāda said, “they will see that the temple is built.”\nIn an urgent mood, Śrīla Prabhupāda left Vṛndāvana for Bombay. His last instruction to Gurudāsa and the others in Vṛndāvana: “An idealgosvāmīshould remain here to challenge any falsegosvāmīs.But if you also become false, then you cannot challenge.”\nBombayMarch 20, 1974Disciples and ISKCON life members continued to discuss with Śrīla Prabhupāda about confronting the police commissioner’s refusal to grant ISKCON permission to build a temple at Hare Krishna Land. Ironically, ISKCON’s property was bordered on one side by a large cinema hall, and every evening, both before and after the movie, a long line of traffic would form. The honking horns and the hundreds of pedestrians coming and going created much noise and congestion. If the neighborhood and government could tolerate a cinema, then how, without prejudice, could they call the Kṛṣṇakīrtanasa nuisance?\nAlthough addressing the specific issue of government permission, Śrīla Prabhupāda also preached on the greater principle of how governments in Kali-yuga restrict religious life. “The government policy,” he said, “is that religion is an opiate of the people. They think religion is just a sentiment. They want to open slaughterhouses and kill these mischief, loitering cows. Their conclusion is that religion has no value. Therefore, their decision is to not encourage these temples and thisbhajana.From their point of view it is useless.”\nSome of Prabhupāda’s Bombay friends suggested he work through the Jan-Sangh political party, which supported Hinduism, and thus form a strong political coalition. But Śrīla Prabhupāda was more concerned to use this opportunity for preaching. “I suggest that we make vigorous propaganda,” he said. “Hold meetings in big halls so that the public may understand, at least, that this movement is very important. Let there be advertisements that we will speak on different subject matters, and then I will come and speak.\n“In that meeting, make a nice gentleman the president. Create public opinion so that they will come and sign, ‘Yes, here must be one temple.’ We will prove from śāstric evidence. As it is stated inBhagavad-gītā,catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ janāḥ sukṛtino ’rjuna.This wordbhajanafrombhajanteisused with reference to the very pious men,sukṛtinaḥ.The opposite kind of man isduṣkṛtinaḥ,the miscreants. Sobhajanais for the pious man, as recommended in theBhagavad-gītā.AndBhagavad-gītāis held in great estimation all over the world. And yet he has accusedbhajanaas nuisance? How rascal and ignorant! We have to make it clear thatbhajanais soimportant.Bhagavad-gītāis meant for solution of all material problems, but the people of India are not accepting it.\n“My disciples can also speak and say, ‘You please come with us. We are foreigners, but we know Kṛṣṇa is not for this or that. So why are you Indians lacking? You accept your culture. We have taken to Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa says that simply bykīrtanaone becomes free from all contamination. So why not join with us? What is the wrong there? It is stated in yourśāstra,and we have adopted it. And we are feeling better. So why you are so callous, you educated youth and gentlemen?’ This kind of propaganda has to be made.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had abandoned the idea of direct political agitation, but he continued to speak against the police commissioner’s decision and to deliberate on overcoming it. He considered the matter from all possible angles, pro and con. At one point he said that if they could not get sanction to build a temple, then they should build a hotel. “I am trying to get sanction,” he said. “If you don’t give permission – then hotel.”\n“Build a hotel in the front and a temple in the rear,” suggested Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied. And he instructed his men further on dealing with opposition. As with the struggle to acquire the land, the present struggle also threatened to become a long legal battle. Prabhupāda remained always transcendental, however, even while fighting. And he maintained his normal activities in Bombay, enjoying the mild tropical climate.\nPrabhupāda liked to sit on the narrow veranda outside his apartment and take his massage in the sun. Surveying the Juhu land, with its many tall coconut trees, their long palm leaves rustling pleasantly in the breeze, Prabhupāda said Hare Krishna Land was a paradise. The devotees were happy.\nOne day during his massage Prabhupāda saw that the contractors, whom he had allowed to come and take coconuts for a set price, were also taking away the leaves to sell in the marketplace. Leaping to his feet, Prabhupāda called from the veranda, “Caityaguru!” Soon the devotee in charge of grounds management appeared before Prabhupāda. “I cannot close my eyes!” Prabhupāda said. “No one else sees these things! You are being cheated!”\nOne day when Prabhupāda criticized a favorite hero, a certain doctor argued back, criticizing Prabhupāda’s statement that the Absolute Truth was Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The doctor and others asserted that the Absolute Truth was many things and that ultimately everything was one. The devotees could barely restrain themselves, but still Prabhupāda always treated these men as his friends.\nEarly the next morning in his room, however, Prabhupāda told his disciples that these men were actually Māyāvādīs. “We will now have a program,” he said, “where we will walk on the beach, but we will only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. If they want to talk, we will just chant, and we will all chant only. If they wish to, they can walk with us.”\n“Prabhupāda,” a devotee said, “they will be restless if we do that.”\n“Even if they don’t chant,” said Prabhupāda, “if they only hear, it will be beneficial for them. Māyāvādī philosophy is very dangerous. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that whoever hears it is doomed.”\nA devotee asked why a Māyāvādī would disguise himself as akṛṣṇa-bhakta.They do it, Prabhupāda said, to get popular reception for being liberal to all. But if a woman says that she is very liberal and acceptsanyman, that may seem to be a liberal proposal, but it is not good. “We will read theKṛṣṇabook on the walk,” Prabhupāda said. “I am walking with my disciples. If these men like, they can join and hear. But if they want to ask questions, they must accept theguru’sanswer without argument. Is that all right?”\nThe next morning, although the usual challengers did not join the walk, Prabhupāda had Girirāja read aloud from theKṛṣṇabook. Suddenly, Prabhupāda sighted the familiar group of speculators approaching from the opposite direction. But as they drew closer, they purposely turned aside so as to avoid Prabhupāda. One of them came over, however, and, representing the entire group, informed Prabhupāda they were not going to walk with him anymore; they had met and decided that their conversations with him created too much argument and criticism. “India has many saints,” the man added.\n“I am the policeman,” Prabhupāda said, “and I have to catch the thief.” After a few days, the same group rejoined Prabhupāda on his walk, and the discussions continued as before. Some of Prabhupāda’s disciples remained disturbed, but Prabhupāda was jolly, correcting his friends like an older brother, teaching them pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nSeveral times a day, Prabhupāda would call for Girirāja and other Bombay managers to confer on the latest strategy in securing permission to build the temple. When Prabhupāda’s Bombay friends would visit, they would often find him on the roof of the tenement, sitting on white cotton sheeting and leaning on white bolsters, preaching the philosophy ofBhagavad-gītāby the hour. He would ask his visitors to help him solidly establish Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Bombay.\nOne day during the massage Prabhupāda confided to his servant, “Most men are retired at my age. I do not want to manage anymore. I just want to do some writing.” Prabhupāda asked if there was some place in the world he could go for six months, a place where he would be all alone, where no one would come to disturb him, and where he would not get any mail.\nPrabhupāda’s servant suggested Tehran. Prabhupāda considered it, then suggested New Vrindaban. He spoke of Mahatma Gandhi, who could not even sleep at night because people were always after him, even though he traveled incognito.\nThat very day a letter came from Bhagavān in Paris, inviting Prabhupāda to tour his ISKCON centers in Europe. Immediately Prabhupāda was enlivened at this invitation. He said he would go.\n“But earlier today,” his servant said, “you wanted to go away and be alone.”\nPrabhupāda laughed. “That will not be possible for me in this lifetime. Better I keep traveling and die on the battlefield. For a warrior, it is glorious to die on the battlefield. Is it not?”\nJust before starting his European tour, Prabhupāda explained to several devotees in his room that they also should travel and preach. He said they should do so while they were young, and then when they were old and matured in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they could go to Māyāpur, retire, and simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. “Of course, for myself,” Prabhupāda added, “I’m not so mature.”\nThe devotees were silent a moment, but then one ventured, “But Śrīla Prabhupāda, if you say that you’re not mature, then how can we ever think that we are old or mature enough to retire?” Prabhupāda smiled and said that they would have to decide for themselves. But he was not mature enough.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami said, “Then we also will never become so mature that we can retire.”\nApril 18Before going to Europe, Prabhupāda responded to an invitation from his devotees in South India to attend a three-daypaṇḍālfestival in Hyderabad. No sooner did he arrive at the airport in Hyderabad, however, than a group of reporters asked him for a press conference.\nPrabhupāda consented, and a reporter opened with a technical philosophical question, inquiring whether Prabhupāda’s philosophy wasadvaitaordvaita.South India was so steeped in the ancient philosophical debate between the Vaiṣṇavas and the Śaṅkarites that here an ordinary news reporter was concerned with comparative philosophies.\nPrabhupāda scoffed at the question. “What is the point of discussing such things,” he challenged “ – whether one isdvaitaoradvaita? Kṛṣṇa says,annād bhavanti bhūtāni. Annameans ‘grains.’ The people have no grains. Grains are produced from the rains, and rains from sacrifice. So perform sacrifice. You have to divide the society into four orders. You may bedvaitaoradvaita,but you need grains.”\nPrabhupāda’s secretary wrote to Bhagavān in Paris, keeping him informed of Prabhupāda’s location and schedule.\nApril 25From Hyderabad Śrīla Prabhupāda flew to Tirupati. There in mountainous Tirumala stands the richest temple in India, where a Deity of Viṣṇu known as Bālajī resides.\nThe temple managers respectfully welcomed Śrīla Prabhupāda and his party, providing them with two cottages on the mountainside. According to the temple policy, people usually have to wait in a long line before seeing the Deity – since fifteen thousand people enter the temple daily – and they are given only a briefdarśana.Non-Hindus are usually not allowed. But Śrīla Prabhupāda and his disciples received the special honor of a privatedarśanaof Bālajī.\nAt the end of a long inner sanctum, its entrance guarded by two large figures of Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers of Vaikuṇṭha, the Deity was enthroned. The only light in the inner sanctum came from flaming torches affixed to the walls or held by thepūjārīs.When approaching the Deity in the hallway, many pilgrims would traditionally call out, “Govinda!” But as Prabhupāda entered, he sang,“Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.”\nLater in his cottage Prabhupāda remarked that the millions of people going to see Bālajī were proof that the masses are still attracted to God, despite government propaganda. Although most people may go to the Lord for alleviating material distress or for getting money, still they called out the holy name, “Govinda!”\nA devotee asked Prabhupāda why the Deity was called Bālajī. “Bālajī,” Prabhupāda said, “means ‘child’ – Kṛṣṇa as a cowherd boy, not in His Vaikuṇṭha aspect.”\nPrabhupāda was pleased to stay in the cottage and take the Deity’sprasādam.He suggested that in New Vrindaban they build cottages like this and that ISKCON build temples like the temple of Bālajī, with its gold dome and extensive facility for visitors.\nOne day an official of the Tirupati temple, while visiting Prabhupāda, mentioned that their collection was about forty lakhs of rupees per month. Prabhupāda inquired how the temple’s income was being spent. When the priest indicated that most of the money went for renovation of the buildings, Prabhupāda replied that temple renovation was good, but propagating the message of Kṛṣṇa all over the world was better. “Bālajī is Kṛṣṇa,” Prabhupāda said. “His message should be spread. He descended as Caitanya Mahāprabhu to teach us.”\nPrabhupāda told the priest of how so many old churches in London were not being used. “How will the spirit of the temple be maintained without preaching?” Prabhupāda asked. The priest then boasted that they were building another temple and installingpañcopāsanā(five deities recommended for worship by the impersonalist Śaṅkarācārya). Prabhupāda was surprised. “Your leader is Rāmānuja,” he said. “He never recommendedpañcopāsanā!”\nFor the two days in Tirupati, Prabhupāda went three or four times daily to see the Deity of Bālajī. And whenever he went, thepūjārīswould clear the inner sanctum of all other visitors and allow him a privatedarśanafor as long as he liked, standing in the torchlight before the mystical, bejeweled form of Bālajī.\nBombayApril 29Although in a few days Prabhupāda would be leaving for Rome, a problem now faced him and the management of his Indian projects. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami was requesting that Prabhupāda allow him to go to America; after four years of management in India, he was eager to try a different kind of preaching. His Godbrother-friend Viṣṇujana Swami had pleased Prabhupāda with his bus-touring in America and had convinced Tamāla Kṛṣṇa that this was the most opportune preaching. Śrīla Prabhupāda had accepted the proposal, although reluctantly. Certainly it would be good for the preaching in America, and it would be good for Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. But what about India? Once again Prabhupāda was faced with the fact that the only manager for ISKCON in India was himself.\nCarefully he reviewed a recent report of the spending and accounts in Māyāpur. Concerned that all money be handled very carefully and spent exactly for the purpose it was intended, he had written to Jayapatāka Swami,\nFrom a previous letter from Śrīla Prabhupāda, Bhavānanda and Jayapatāka had become a little despondent, thinking that they may have displeased their spiritual master. But Prabhupāda reassured them,\nPrabhupāda also scrutinized the finances in Vṛndāvana, where Gurudāsa was president and Tejās, in Delhi, was financial supervisor. Reviewing Tejās’s latest request, Prabhupāda wrote back,\nPrabhupāda also found a serious inconsistency in the accounting, which he pointed out to Tejās for correction.\nGurudāsa and Tejās had assured Prabhupāda that the Krishna-Balaram Mandir would be ready to open by July l974. Prabhupāda designed the invitation cards himself and asked that they be printed and sent to important persons.\nWith only three months left, Prabhupāda’s plans were to travel from May through July. Giving permission for transferring funds from Delhi to Vṛndāvana, he left. He would return in three months for the grand opening."

        "content": "ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA’S FIRST two stops in Europe were Rome and Geneva. In both places devotees had arranged many outside speaking engagements as well as meetings with important guests in Prabhupāda’s room. The Rome temple was a small house at a busy intersection near Piazza Lodi. Traffic was relentless, its noise penetrating into Prabhupāda’s quarters within the temple building. “I hope the noise of the traffic doesn’t bother you too much,” Dhanañjaya, the temple president, apologized.\n“No,” Prabhupāda replied, “this sound is very pleasing. It means this is a very important part of Rome. This is a very good location.”\nAt the Villa Borghese, in a hotel hall built to seat five hundred people, Prabhupāda spoke before a crowd of more than one thousand. Prabhupāda was pleased by the enthusiastic gathering of Italians, who behaved as if coming to receive the blessings of the Pope. They were pious, but they had not been taught properly how to engage in the Lord’s service. This, he said, was the one defect. Although the devotees had arranged a meeting between Prabhupāda and the Pope, the Pope was ill, so Prabhupāda met with Cardinal Pignedoli, who was in charge of non-Christian liaisons.\nIn flying to Geneva, Prabhupāda and his secretaries viewed the snow-covered Alps. “This is a very dangerous spot,” Prabhupāda remarked as the plane flew above the alpine peaks. “Many planes have crashed here.”\nIn Geneva the mayor offered Prabhupāda an official reception. Everything went smoothly, according to diplomatic protocol. Afterward, the mayor asked frankly, “If everyone became like you are saying, wouldn’t the economy be threatened?”\nPrabhupāda said no. And he quoted the same verse he had given to press reporters in Hyderabad:annād bhavanti bhūtāni.Grains are produced by rains, which are produced by sacrifice to Viṣṇu. Prabhupāda proposed that if men cultivated their own land and kept cows, they would have no economic problems. Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees could work in all ways of life within society; in fact, they could teach how to organize society according to God conscious principles.\nWhile returning to the temple, Prabhupāda asked, “Were my answers all right?” One of the devotees replied that he thought the mayor considered the devotees beggars. “Therefore,” Prabhupāda said, “I told him about tilling the land. We are not beggars. We are giving the highest knowledge. I gave him a copy ofBhagavad-gītā,the highest knowledge. He could not give us anything. So who is the beggar?”\nPrabhupāda accepted an invitation in Geneva to speak at the World Health Organization of the United Nations. He also met at the temple with Indologist Jean Hurbert and with several scientists and professors.\nAfter speaking for a few hours with Karandhara, Prabhupāda decided he would be just the man to take up the heavy responsibilities of G.B.C. of India. He should make his headquarters in Bombay and help the devotees there get the No-Objection Certificate. It was a bold move for Prabhupāda, based on trust in his disciple and on the immediate need for Kṛṣṇa conscious leadership in India. He had his secretary immediately type a letter to the leaders of the temples in Hyderabad, Bombay, Calcutta, Māyāpur, Delhi, and Vṛndāvana, authorizing Karandhara’s appointment as the new Governing Body Commissioner for India. “It is a great relief for me,” wrote Prabhupāda. “Please give him all cooperation and work together for advancement of our mission to make the people of India Kṛṣṇa conscious.”\nParisJune 8Twenty-five hundred people in the audience as well as fifty devotees onstage awaited Śrīla Prabhupāda’s appearance at La Salle Pleyel in Paris. Afterkīrtana, Prabhupāda began his lecture by having a devotee read in the Bible from the Gospel of St.John: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.” Prabhupāda then spoke on the power of the holy name as transcendental sound.\nMany persons in the crowd were student radicals, who specifically came to cause trouble. And Śrīla Prabhupāda gave an analogy that agitated them, comparing the conditioned soul’s existence in the material world to a citizen’s punishment for breaking the laws of the state. As soon as Prabhupāda said that disobedient citizens would be punished, the students began to boo and yell. He was speaking in English, and his disciple Jyotirmayī-devī dāsī was translating each line over the microphone. When the students began shouting, Prabhupāda turned to Jyotirmayī and asked, “What are they saying?”\n“They don’t like the example you have given,” she replied, “because they don’t like the government here.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then spoke back to the challengers, “You may not like it, but the fact of the matter is that if you break the laws you will be punished.” He was speaking of the absolute law ofkarma,but the student radicals took it politically. They continued shouting at Prabhupāda. One man jumped up and shouted loudly in French, “You may be speaking spiritual things, but one thing I would never do is sit on a throne and demand that people bow down to my feet!” At these words the audience began applauding and whistling and chanting the words “Par terre!Par terre!Par terre!” Prabhupāda again asked for a translation. Jyotirmayī told him they were shouting, “Get down!”\nReturning the challenge, Prabhupāda spoke strongly into the microphone: “I could speak to you from the floor also, but that does not mean you would understand any better. If you know the science of God consciousness, then you also can sit on thevyāsāsana,and they will bow down at your feet.”\nPrabhupāda’s strong reply brought silence to the hall, as if his answer had satisfied the challengers. Suddenly a black man jumped up on the stage and addressed himself to the theater audience. He began by speaking in defense of Prabhupāda and the devotees, but then he began speaking against them. Finally he began speaking incoherently, and Prabhupāda turned to his disciples onstage and said, “All right, havekīrtana.” The devotees rose with drums andkaratālasand began a rousingkīrtana.Most of the people in attendance joined also, and the protests were drowned out.\nAfter this tumultuous scene, while riding back to the temple, Prabhupāda said that in the future they should not give him avyāsāsanato sit on before public audiences; in the future they should give him a simple cushion to sit on. He also doubted the value of explaining philosophy to such large audiences. For the balance of his stay in Paris he spoke to smaller groups who were actually interested to hear him.\nFrankfurtJune 18When Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived, Haṁsadūta and a large group of devotees accompanied him in a procession of twenty cars and vans to the outskirts of the city to the ISKCON center, Schloss Rettershof, a castle on a hill. “My heart becomes engladdened when I hear amṛdaṅgain a German village,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said.\nThe devotees showed Prabhupāda the Schloss. The central room was a large ground-floor hall with a ceiling two stories high. A second-floor gallery, overlooking the hall, led to Prabhupāda’s quarters. While Śrīla Prabhupāda was in his room, the assembled devotees from centers all over Germany and from Amsterdam gathered downstairs, where they held a wildly enthusiastickīrtana.After half an hour Haṁsadūta appeared at the railing and motioned to the devotees to come up to Prabhupāda’s room.\nSomehow the devotees managed to squeeze into Prabhupāda’s quarters or to at least stand in the hallway and watch, as Prabhupāda sat, relaxed, speaking informally. “I worked hard my whole life,” he said. “I never liked to sit idle. So devotional service means to be always engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service. Not like the servants in Calcutta. They get an order, and then they go to Dalhousie Park and sleep all day. Then when they come back late, the master asks them, ‘Where have you been all day?’ And they reply, ‘I was busy working for you.’ Not like that, you see?”\nPrabhupāda laughed, and all the devotees also began laughing, although most of them understood very little English. Prabhupāda then quoted Lord Caitanya’s prophecy that His name would be heard in every town and village. The devotees’ chanting in the villages of Germany, he said, was fulfilling that prediction.\n“But unfortunately,” he added, “people object, just like the man who is being saved from danger.” He gave the example of a man on a roof flying a kite. When another man, seeing him about to walk off the roof, called out to him, “Look out, you’re in danger!” the man on the roof became angry and said, “What, you have checked my movement?” Any gentleman, Prabhupāda said, will speak out if he sees another in danger, even though the one in danger may object.\nPrabhupāda’s German devotees accompanied him on speaking engagements in nearby towns, and although he was not very enthusiastically received by most people, the devotees became more dedicated than ever to give their lives in the service of Prabhupāda and Kṛṣṇa. For his public engagements he sat on a small cushion, so as not to again arouse the indignation of people who could not understand the tradition of theguru.\nAt one engagement a wealthy businessman, two of whose sons were Prabhupāda’s disciples, questioned Prabhupāda. “How can a crocodile of the Nile swim in a German river? In other words, how can you transplant a foreign culture with Indian ways and dress to Germany?”\n“You can become Kṛṣṇa conscious in a tie and suit,” Prabhupāda replied.\n“Isn’t this chanting self-hypnosis?” asked another man.\n“No,” Prabhupāda replied staunchly, “it is purification.” And so it went – mostly challenges, with a few sincere inquiries.\nWhile Prabhupāda was in Frankfurt, two interested, distinguished visitors came to see him: a Benedictine monk, Father Emmanuel, and Baron von Dürckheim, a prominent German philosopher and spiritual writer. Both men were attracted by Prabhupāda’s philosophical explanations and accompanied him on his morning walks for several days.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s next stop was Australia. He had worked out a schedule whereby he would attend three Ratha-yātrā festivals in three cities: first in Melbourne, then a week later in Chicago, and two days later in San Francisco. He would then go to Los Angeles, Dallas, and New Vrindaban, timing everything for his return to Vṛndāvana by July 25 for the Krishna-Balaram Mandir opening two weeks later.\nHe was now regularly referring to the opening date of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir as a time when many devotees from around the world could gather at Vṛndāvana to be with him. On June 17 he had written from Germany to Jayahari in London.\nAfter a twenty-hour flight from Frankfurt to Australia, Prabhupāda was picked up at the Melbourne airport by devotees in a borrowed Rolls Royce. The newspaper reporters were quick to notice the car. “DIVINE GRACE COMES ROLLSING IN,” read one headline. The story began, “Sixty young Hare Krishna devotees yesterday welcomed their earthly leader to the city with obeisances – but official Melbourne met him coolly.”\nAnother story began, “A chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce will meet the founder of the materialistic-shunning Hare Krishna sect, Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, at Tullamarine today.” Another newspaper showed a large picture of Śrīla Prabhupāda smiling and bore the headline “H.D.G. IS HERE TO HOUND US.” The story began,\nNews coverage of Prabhupāda’s visit didn’t end with reports on his arrival at the airport. The next day, while the devotees were preparing the Ratha-yātrā carts, an extraordinary incident resulted in front-page headlines inThe Herald.\nThe article was accompanied by two large pictures showing “Hare Krishnas” holding the large canvas canopy.\nAlthough the news media was unable to understand the disciples’ love for Śrīla Prabhupāda, the rescue was something everyone could relate to. Wrote a columnist inThe Australian,\nThe columnist coyly speculated whether the devotees’ “holy rug” was still usable in the religious festival as a canopy for His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda.\nThe incident proved to be good publicity for the festival the next day, when Lord Jagannātha, the Lord of the universe, and His pure devotee, Śrīla Prabhupāda, held a Ratha-yātrā procession through the main streets of Melbourne. Regarding media coverage, Prabhupāda had said that simply the printing of the holy names Hare Kṛṣṇa greatly benefited the readers, regardless of whether the names were mentioned in reverence or disrespect.\nAmogha:Prabhupāda met Lord Jagannātha at City Square by Town Hall. There was avyāsāsanaon the cart, but he chose to walk before the carts, in front of the Deity of Lord Caitanya. Prabhupāda was wearing a gold wool cap, a peach-colored turtleneck jersey, and an effulgent silk saffrondhotīandkurtā.Around his shoulders he wore a white silkcādar,and he wore a garland of orchids and many yellow flowers. It was winter in Melbourne and quite cold, but he put his hands up and chanted and danced.\nWe had about eleven newmṛdaṅgas.There were also three men playing big bass drums. And we all formed a circle around Śrīla Prabhupāda. It was ecstatic, all playing drums, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and Prabhupāda himself chanting in the parade, going on through the city. Prabhupāda marched with transcendental power, just taking over the city, walking right down Swanson Street.\nSabhāpati:From the point of view of weather, it wasn’t a very nice day. Prabhupāda met therathacart at the corner of Swanson Street and Burk Street, and he led from there on. He walked about two miles. All the devotees had been havingkīrtanain three different groups, but when Prabhupāda met the Ratha-yātrā procession we all gathered around him. He was leading the procession. Behind him was a fourteen-footmūrtiof Lord Caitanya, followed by threerathacarts. Every now and again in the procession Prabhupāda would stop and turn around and stare up at Lord Caitanya. He would simply stand and look up at Lord Caitanya for a minute or two, and then he would turn around again and lead the procession. It was such an ecstatic experience that one gets the feeling that Prabhupāda had conquered Melbourne, and Australia.\nGaura Gopāla:I was right next to Prabhupāda through the whole ceremony, playing the drum. He particularly liked to sing one tune through the whole time. He put his hands up in the air. He was dancing.\nVaikuṇṭhanātha:The Ratha-yātrā parade was going, and Prabhupāda was walking, and at one point he asked me, “Get me some water.” I became panic-stricken because there was nowhere to get water. So I just depended on Kṛṣṇa and ran over to a house as fast as I could and asked the people for some water. They gave it, and I ran back to Śrīla Prabhupāda. When I was getting that water, though, there was this big rainbow out, and it had actually begun to rain a little bit. It was a very vivid rainbow, and the end of the rainbow came right down on top of the huge building where the Ratha-yātrā ended.\nHari-śauri:There is a huge place, the Exhibition Buildings, and we had rented one section of it where the roof was about eighty feet high. So therathacarts were taken in with the tops lowered, and then the tops were put up again inside the hall. All threerathacarts were brought in, and the tops were pulled up. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda came in, and everyone was seated. About a thousand people were there. Śrīla Prabhupāda sat up on thevyāsāsanaon therathacart itself and gave a lecture from there.\nSabhāpati:Although it was a cold and rather nasty day, there were a thousand people in that Exhibition Building. Prabhupāda’s lecture was brief: He thanked everyone for coming along and joining in thesaṅkīrtanamovement of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He told everyone he was very appreciative of how they had come to see Lord Jagannātha and of how they were taking part. He said that actually all these activities of singing and dancing were due to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.\nThe Melbourne newspapers duly reported the Ratha-yātrā: “A day for cymbals and chants,” “Chariots top the Swami.” One newspaper reported, “Don’t let Krishna alarm you: cleric.”\nThe article praised the devotees’ “reaction against extreme materialism” and reported the events of the Ratha-yātrā parade. Reverend Powell, head bishop of the Anglican Church in Melbourne, had paid Śrīla Prabhupāda a visit, and this had resulted in the bishop’s Sunday sermon comment that “Hare Krishnas” were not alarming. Śrīla Prabhupāda took the bishop’s comments as very significant.\nThat same evening in his room Prabhupāda met with the vicar-general of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia, Reverend J. A. Kelly. Prabhupāda played a recording of his morning’s lecture at St. Pascal’s, and afterward the Reverend asked if Prabhupāda would pose with him for a picture to be printed in their religious periodical. Again, the newspapers picked it up: “Swami spreads unity message.”\nJuly 1In Melbourne Prabhupāda dictated a letter to Gurudāsa in Vṛndāvana. It was less than six weeks before the scheduled opening of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir, and Śrīla Prabhupāda had not received regular reports from Vṛndāvana. He was concerned that everything be ready on time for a gorgeous ceremony.\nWhile Gurudāsa got direct instruction on the ceremony, almost every other devotee Prabhupāda wrote received his personal invitation to the Krishna-Balaram Mandir opening. In a letter to Cyavana Mahārāja in West Africa, Prabhupāda wrote,\nThe audience, which had been quiet until the interruption, now became noisy and restless. Three of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s more aggressive disciples left the front row and went to the back, where the man was shouting. Meanwhile Śrīla Prabhupāda stopped speaking and sat tolerantly, waiting. The shouting stopped, and he began again. “As I was explaining, in material life we have been changing from one body to another. This is not a very good condition of life. Nobody wants to die, but he is forced to die.”\nAfter five minutes, the abusive language again broke out. This time Śrīla Prabhupāda’s three disciples pushed the shouters out the back door. In the fight, one of the students pulled a knife from his boot, but a devotee disarmed him.\nThe atmosphere inside the auditorium was tense, and many people were talking loudly. Some got up to leave. Madhudviṣa Swami, taking the microphone, pleaded with the students to remain calm and continue hearing from Śrīla Prabhupāda. Some students in the audience seemed on the verge of violence, and the devotees feared for Prabhupāda’s safety. But Prabhupāda was willing to continue. He called for questions.\nStudent: “I am a Christian, and I would like to know what is your opinion of Jesus Christ.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “We respect Jesus Christ as you do, because he is representative of God, son of God. We are also speaking of God, so we respect him with our greatest veneration.”\nQuestion: “You are a son of Jesus too?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “Yes, I am a servant of Jesus. I don’t say I am Jesus.”\nQuestion: “I want to know if you have the power of Jesus?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “No, I have no power of Jesus.”\nQuestion: “Well, I’ve got the power of Jesus! [Laughter.] Because I’m a Christian.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “That’s all right. You are Christian. We are Kṛṣṇian. It is practically the same thing.” (Laughter and applause.)\nStudent: “I have one other question. I believe Jesus is coming back, and not Kṛṣṇa. What are you guys going to do when you see Jesus?” (Laughter)\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “When he is coming, welcome. We shall welcome. It is very good news that Jesus is coming.”\nStudent: “Jesus had no reputation. He wore sandals and was crucified between two thieves. And your spirituality is on a Rolls Royce and a padded seat, and you’re all into money – you Kṛṣṇas, you want money.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “I don’t want money.”\nStudent: “And you say violence is violence, that’s what you believe. Jesus turned the other cheek, and he expected his followers to.” (Applause.)\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not a sentimental religious system. It is science and philosophy.” Prabhupāda explained that understanding the science of God was transcendental to Christianity or Hinduism. The real goal was to learn to love God.\nSecond student: “I have a question about Krishnamurti. Krishnamurti stresses that when you are speaking in the Western world, you should speak and present yourself as a Westerner, not as an Indian or as you would speak in India. Instead of sitting on a raised dais and dressing in the robes of a monk, Krishnamurti would say dress in Western clothes and sit on a chair. What is your opinion of this?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “Actually a God conscious person is neither a Westerner nor Easterner. So anywhere the devotee goes, as they receive him, he accepts. These devotees have arranged a raised seat, so I have accepted the raised seat. If they wanted me to sit down on the floor, I would have gladly accepted. I have no objection to this or that. But as devotees receive and give honor, that is good for them, because actually we should honor the Supreme Lord God and His representative. Nowadays it is different. Students are not learning to honor. But that is not actually the system. According to the Vedic system, the representative of God must be honored as God.”\nAnother student (loudly): “Do you consider your movement the major form of enlightenment emanating from the United States today? What particular role does your movement play in the White House psychological warfare department? Will you be coming to our Fourth of July demonstration against the United States this year and take up the real political issues?”\nAgain many students began shouting. Madhudviṣa Swami took the microphone. “I can answer if you like. Our movement is not from the United States. If you have some paranoia that everything is coming from the United States, well, that is your hang-up, not mine. [Applause.] And second of all, our spiritual master came to the United States to start this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement because he got a free ticket on the boat to go there. If you would have sent him a free ticket, he probably would have come to Australia first. So he is trying to spread love of God. He is not trying to start any kind of political movement. He is trying to spark a revolutionary consciousness. I think you are also interested in revolution. We are interested in revolution also. But we are interested in revolution which will help people to feel peace themselves, whether they are Communists or Marxists or whatever it is you like. We are trying to help people attain happiness whether they are – ”\nMadhudviṣa Swami’s remarks triggered the largest vocal protest yet. The commotion rose as students all over the hall began to shout. There was no possibility of a peaceful philosophical discussion.\nThe devotees’ greatest concern became getting Prabhupāda out of the hall unharmed. Prabhupāda rose from hisvyāsāsanaand, escorted by his disciples, left by a side exit. A large crowd of students had gathered outside the door as Prabhupāda emerged, but he entered his waiting car without incident. As he rode slowly through a cluster of students a girl kicked at the car with her booted foot. And as the devotees were getting into their vans students threw stones. Finally, as the devotees drove off the campus, they had to pass under an elevated walkway where some waiting students threw black paint down onto the vans.\nRiding in his car, Prabhupāda was mostly silent, but he seemed disgusted. He said that in the future, he would only give lectures in classes where he was invited; no more wide-open lectures.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda flew from Melbourne to Chicago, stopping overnight in Hawaii. His schedule allowed him only a couple of days in Chicago, where he would attend that city’s first Ratha-yātrā festival.\nHe was very keen on holding Ratha-yātrās in big cities around the world. And although large crowds often could not hear Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy without becoming restless, angered, or even violent, everyone could enjoy and benefit from a Ratha-yātrā festival. Śrīla Prabhupāda had written inThe Nectar of Devotion,quoting from theBhaviṣya Purāṇa,“A person who follows the Ratha-yātrā car when therathaspass in front or from behind, even if born of a lowly family, will surely be elevated to the position of achieving equal opulence with Viṣṇu.”\nIn Jagannātha Purī, India, the original home of Jagannātha worship, a Westerner could see Lord Jagannātha only during the yearly Ratha-yātrā festival, when the Deity would come out of the temple and ride on His cart. And besides, very few Westerners would actually go to Jagannātha Purī. But Śrīla Prabhupāda and his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement were making Lord Jagannātha available to everyone by bringing the Ratha-yātrā right down the main street of their city. It may seem odd to the average American or Australian, but from the viewpoint of Lord Jagannātha and His followers, it was perfectly proper. Lord Jagannātha, “the Lord of the universe,” was for everyone, everywhere, regardless of nationality or religion.\nThis year’s festival, 1974, would mark the eighth annual San Francisco Ratha-yātrā. And now, at Prabhupāda’s urging, devotees in more and more cities were beginning to hold the festival. Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted to give utmost prestige to this kind of preaching, and so he had gone out of his way to come to Chicago, where he had never been before, just to ride an hour down State Street on Lord Jagannātha’s cart. Prabhupāda felt that his disciples, by holding Ratha-yātrās in cities on every continent, would defeat false religion. And spontaneously people would be attracted to Kṛṣṇa, simply by enjoying a festival of singing, dancing, feasting, and seeing the Lord.\nThe city was busy with thousands of shoppers and workers. Many members of Chicago’s large Indian community had turned out to receive the Lord’s blessings and to observe this tradition so well known to them. And hundreds of Prabhupāda’s disciples from throughout the Midwest had gathered to pull on the ropes of the cart, leadkīrtanas,and distributeprasādamandBack to Godheadmagazines as the big cart plied down one of the busiest streets in America.\nAlthough several policemen on motorcycles led the procession, their mood was hardly that of the King of Orissa, who had traditionally led the Ratha-yātrā procession in India. Each year the king would present himself as a menial servant, leading the parade by sweeping the road before Lord Jagannātha with a gold-handled broom. The Chicago police, however, seemed intent only in getting the parade over with as soon as possible. With stern anxiety they dedicated themselves to keeping open the flow of ordinary automobile traffic. They acknowledged that the devotees had an official permit for the parade, but they continually prodded them to pull the cart faster, threatening to terminate the parade entirely.\nBy Kṛṣṇa’s grace, however, everyone, including the Chicago police, became satisfied as the procession moved along peacefully for several miles, finally arriving at the Civic Center Plaza. Amid skyscrapers and city noise, Śrīla Prabhupāda addressed the outdoor audience. Immediately following the lecture, the devotees beganprasādamdistribution andkīrtana.Prabhupāda was pleased by the festival.\nSan FranciscoJuly 7Thousands followed the three carts for several miles through Golden Gate Park. Śrīla Prabhupāda, riding on the second cart, beneath the deity of Subhadrā, wore the same golden wool cap he had worn in Australia, a white bulky knit sweater, and a garland of red roses. Despite his recent extensive traveling, he was alert and well. He looked out at the sea of devotees and parade-followers and took great satisfaction in the transcendental scene.\nIn his speech before a crowd of ten thousand, Prabhupāda said that the Americans should lead the world in propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness. “I know that all American ladies and gentlemen here are educated and intelligent,” he said, “and I am very much obliged to the Americans who have helped me make this movement popular all over the world. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu first introduced the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, He said,bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra/ janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra.He thus expressed His desire by saying that anyone who has taken birth as a human being in Bhārata-varṣa, or India, should understand the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and spread it all over the world for the benefit of all humanity. He also predicted that in all the villages and towns of the entire world the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will be known.\n“So with the cooperation of you young Americans who are kindly helping to spread this movement, it is now factually becoming well known all over the world. I recently went to Melbourne, Australia, where we held a similar festival in which many thousands of people joined and chanted and danced with us. Then I went to Chicago, where we held the same ceremony. Now this morning I have come here, and I am so glad to see that you are also joining this movement.”\nPrabhupāda’s fingers tapped lightly against hiskaratālasas he spoke, his eyes half closed. He chose his words with confidence, and those words echoed across the meadow. Prabhupāda requested his audience not to think that Kṛṣṇa consciousness was sectarian; it was meant for everyone, because the real nature of the self was spiritual. Chanting the holy name and dancing, he said, were not ordinary.\n“It is open to everyone who will simply chant themahā-mantra:Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. You are generally young, whereas I am an old man who may die at any moment. Therefore I request you to take this movement seriously. Understand it yourselves, and then preach it throughout your country. People outside America generally follow and imitate what America does. I am traveling all over the world, and everywhere I see other countries building skyscrapers and in other ways imitating your country. Therefore if you kindly become Kṛṣṇa conscious and chant and dance in ecstasy, in emotional love of God, the entire world will follow you. Thus the entire world can become Vaikuṇṭha, a spiritual world in which there will be no more trouble. Thank you very much.”\nGurudāsa had sent a letter to all ISKCON centers inviting devotees to attend the opening of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir in Vṛndāvana. He had invited life members from Bombay and Calcutta and had reserved cars for them on the trains. Prabhupāda also was inviting his disciples to come to Vṛndāvana for Janmāṣṭamī. Lecturing before hundreds of devotees in Los Angeles, he said, “I invite all of you to come to Vṛndāvana to the opening of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir.”\nPrabhupāda had also mailed invitations to his Godbrothers, and when one of them, Śrīdhara Mahārāja of Navadvīpa, accepted the invitation, Śrīla Prabhupāda replied, assuring him of comfortable accommodations and suggesting the easiest way to travel from Calcutta to Vṛndāvana. Śrīla Prabhupāda also told Śrīdhara Mahārāja of his preaching.\nOn July 15, only ten days before Prabhupāda’s proposed arrival in Vṛndāvana, he wrote almost identical letters to hissannyāsīdisciples, inviting them to come and resolve the many personal matters and items of business that had been pending during his busy tour.\nWhen Karandhara, the newly-appointed G.B.C. for India, began to express doubts that everything would be ready on time, Prabhupāda replied from Los Angeles,\nAlthough Prabhupāda had responded to Karandhara forcefully, the note of uncertainty from his head manager in India disturbed him. He wrote to Surabhi, who was in charge of the Vṛndāvana construction, “I am a little agitated in mind because Karandhara’s letter says that there may be some work to be done even during the time of our festival.”\nPrabhupāda said that if the City continued to prohibit the parade, the devotees should erect a stationary cart in Hyde Park and hold a festival there, without a procession. “After holding our ceremony,” said Prabhupāda, “we shall take the deity in a palanquin and go to Trafalgar Square. Therathawill stay. It will not move. But we shall take the deities on palanquin and go to Trafalgar Square. In this way, take police permission and, after going there along with the ceremony, protest. They cannot object. But therathamust be seen. And the people must know that the rascal police government has stopped it.”\nPrabhupāda repeated his instructions several times. He was in a grave mood as he instructed his followers. “My Guru Mahārāja used to say,prāṇa āche yāṅra sei hetu pracāra:one who has got life, he can preach. The dead man cannot preach. So you become with life, not like dead man. Just like all my Godbrothers, they are dead men. And therefore they are envious of my activities. They have no life. If you want to make an easygoing life, showing the Deity and then sleep, then it is a failure movement.”\nPrabhupāda could not bear to hear that such an important festival as Ratha-yātrā was being stopped. “We shall abide by all the rules,” he said, “but we must have this festival. They saw last year that in the open sunshine thousands of people, tens of thousands of people, stood in Trafalgar Square for three hours. And they do not go to the church. So they have seen there is something. Otherwise, how people have taken so much interest?”\nBrahmānanda Swami: “Yes, just like in the San Francisco paper, they admitted, ‘This is the most popular festival.’ ”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, fifteen thousand people attended my lecture silently in San Francisco. So they are seeing there is something in the movement. But sometimes some parties do not want us to go on without objection, or else they will be finished.”\n“So that is my request. I am traveling all over the world. I am going to see how things are going in Dallas and New Vrindaban. So my touring is natural. I have started this movement. I want to see that it is going nicely.Don’t deviate.That is my only request.” Prabhupāda began to cry and simply concluded, “Then you will remain solid. Thank you very much.”\nNew VrindabanJuly 18, 1974A letter from Karandhara reached Śrīla Prabhupāda, informing him of his resignation as G.B.C. for India. The responsibilities were too great for him, for he had only recently come back to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He would continue to follow the spiritual program, but he could not be the G.B.C. Again Śrīla Prabhupāda was set back, and before several G.B.C. men in his room at New Vrindaban he asked, “What to do? What shall we do? So maybe I should just give up these projects in India.”\n“But Śrīla Prabhupāda,” the devotees replied, “those India projects are very dear to you.”\n“But what can be done?” Prabhupāda asked.\nBecause there was no regular G.B.C. secretary for India, Prabhupāda did not receive accurate reports on the Vṛndāvana temple construction. When Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami had left in April to preach in the West, several months had passed before Prabhupāda had appointed a replacement, Karandhara. Now, after only a few weeks, Karandhara had resigned. Gurudāsa’s version, therefore, was the only one Prabhupāda had received. The end of July grew near, and devotees prepared to travel to Vṛndāvana – for a fiasco.\nVṛndāvanaAugust 4, 1974When Prabhupāda’s car pulled up at the ISKCON property in Ramaṇa-reti, a group of devotees greeted him withkīrtanaand flowers. Some twenty-five devotees from temples around the world had already gathered for the grand opening celebration, and along with the Vṛndāvana devotees they crowded happily around Śrīla Prabhupāda. No formal walkways had been constructed, and Prabhupāda walked through the half-constructed walls, past piles of sand and bricks, making his way toward the Deity house. Even here the lack of ornamentation and finishing was apparent, and rubble lay all around.\n“What is this?” Prabhupāda demanded as he toured the construction site. “There is nothing here. Where is the temple? You told me the temple was finished.” Gurudāsa, Surabhi, Guṇārṇava, and others directly responsible were unable to answer. Their faces went white.\nPrabhupāda was furious. “How can you open this?”\nThe visiting devotees also began speaking among themselves: “It’s not ready. How can we open?”\n“But Prabhupāda,” said one devotee, “devotees from all over the world are coming.”\n“Stop them immediately!” Prabhupāda said. “There will be no opening!”\nPrabhupāda had burst the bubble, the illusion that they would be ready for the grand opening. Prabhupāda’s anger was frightening, and the devotees who surrounded him were no longer carefree and joyful. “You were going to open this temple?” Prabhupāda scoffed.\n“The altar is ready,” said Harikeśa, who had come from Japan to attend the opening. “We can install the Deity and – ”\n“You cannot open this temple!” Prabhupāda shouted. “This temple is not completed!”\nPrabhupāda then walked into his house, followed by the Vṛndāvana managers and a few other leaders. Whoever could keep his distance from Prabhupāda in this mood considered himself spared. Surabhi’s wife ran off to pray to Kṛṣṇa, afraid of Prabhupāda’s ferocity.\nIn his room Prabhupāda’s anger only increased. He yelled at Gurudāsa for mismanagement. He yelled at Surabhi. He yelled at all of them. No one dared to offer suggestions or excuses. There was nothing to do but turn white and become depressed. Prabhupāda suddenly inquired whether the temple could be opened, despite the mess. “Can you have the Deity rooms ready at least?” He turned to Surabhi. “This is an insult to our Society. What will people think? We have announced it everywhere!”\n“Nobody actually knows about it, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Surabhi replied fearfully, exposing himself for another blast.\n“Oh?” Prabhupāda somewhat changed his tone. “You have not made any propaganda about it? No invitations?”\n“Not yet, Prabhupāda. Not to the people in Vṛndāvana. They do not expect it to open, because everyone who has been here can see that it is not possible to open. They know it’s not ready.”\n“This is a farce,” Prabhupāda scowled. “It is a fiasco.” Disgusted, he looked at his Vṛndāvana managers. “We have to open. How can we open on Janmāṣṭamī?”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Surabhi said, “the doors are not ready. They are still cutting the wood.” Prabhupāda inquired about the Deities from Yamunā, who explained that Their paraphernalia had been purchased but that the thrones were not ready.\n“What is your opinion?” he asked her.\n“I am totally unqualified to speak,” Yamunā said, “and although I have no right to speak, I see it as almost impossible to actually open the temple. There is nopūjārī.”\nWith a sense of finality and failure, Prabhupāda said, “Then we won’t do it. But we have invited so many people from all around the world to come, and I was not informed of this. Now you all decide.\n“Whencan we open?” Prabhupāda asked. “Can we open on Diwali? When is Diwali?”\n“October, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\n“How about Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī’s appearance day?” a devotee suggested. “That’s at the end of December.”\nPrabhupāda was silent, looking displeased. Surabhi spoke up. “It will take six months, actually seven months.” Then Prabhupāda chose the day of Rāma-navamī, in April; the opening could coincide with the annual gathering of devotees in Māyāpur and Vṛndāvana.\nSurabhi spoke again. He had grown pessimistic from his experiences with construction in India. “It depends on whether we can get the cement, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said. “We have to get it from the government. That was the main obstacle preventing us from opening now. We could possibly have the opening in three months, if we could get cement.”\n“All right,” Prabhupāda said, resigned – there was no use trying to set a date. “It will be done before next Janmāṣṭamī.” His tone was sarcastic. “And if the cement can be obtained, it can be done after three months.”\nLater, while meeting with various individuals, Prabhupāda continued to express his displeasure, especially to Gurudāsa. He asked questions but was dissatisfied with the answers. He asked Gurudāsa to bring the financial records, and then he reprimanded him more. Finding a receipt for Gurudāsa’s stay in an expensive hotel in Jaipur, Prabhupāda made an issue of it. Gurudāsa became aloof. When Prabhupāda finished talking with him, Gurudāsa returned to his room, staying there unless Śrīla Prabhupāda called for him.\nPrabhupāda began talking about changing the temple presidents in Vṛndāvana; he suggested Harikeśa. Gurudāsa and his wife, he said, could be in charge of the guesthouse, which was as yet only a hole in the ground. He called Gurudāsa again and asked what he thought of his managing the Vṛndāvana guesthouse, suggesting he go to the Jaipuria Guesthouse in Vṛndāvana for ideas about management.\n“But Prabhupāda,” Gurudāsa said, “they charge such low rates at the Jaipuria Guesthouse. I’m sure those rates must be subsidized.”\n“This Mr. Jaipuria is a Marwari businessman,” Prabhupāda replied. “He’s not losing money on the guesthouse. He’s making money. That is the art of management. That you have to learn by going there and seeing.” But Gurudāsa felt too exhausted by the austerities of living and managing in India, where Prabhupāda’s attention and criticism were so demanding and intense and where everything was so difficult. He and his wife began to think of leaving Vṛndāvana.\nPrabhupāda continued to pressure Surabhi, calling him in at different times of the day. “Why aren’t these Deity doors up?” Prabhupāda demanded.\n“I am trying, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Surabhi replied. “There are so many things to do.”\n“Never mind,” Prabhupāda said, “you have to get it done. These hired men are all cheating you. Don’t let them cheat you. It is not easy for all these devotees to collect money. It is all Kṛṣṇa’s money and can only be used for Kṛṣṇa’s projects. Protect that money and see it doesn’t go in the hands of the wrong people. I don’t want the contractors to become rich men because of our projects. And I want marble on that building. Where is the marble?”\n“Where can I get marble?” Surabhi asked.\n“Why are you asking me these questions?” Prabhupāda shouted. “You are the expert. I don’t know. Use your intelligence.”\nUltimately, Prabhupāda’s anger with his disciples was incidental, the reaction due them for their foolishness. It was also a way of instructing them and testing them. But deeper was Prabhupāda’s transcendental impatience and frustration that his devotional service in Vṛndāvana was still not manifested. He wanted a wonderful temple for the glory of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, a temple that would establish Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. It was an offering to his spiritual master, and he had promised it to Kṛṣṇa. But still it was not completed.\nAs for Prabhupāda’s disciples’ failure to do the job, Prabhupāda had to take the burden and the agony of that failure. His disciples were his instruments in his service to Kṛṣṇa. If the instruments didn’t work properly, then he suffered, just as when one’s arms and legs fail to function, the whole body suffers. His disciples’ failure to carry out his desires was his loss. In this way, he felt transcendental lamentation over their failure to open the Krishna-Balaram Mandir on Janmāṣṭamī day.\nPrabhupāda’s disturbance, though transcendental, was nonetheless real; it was not feigned merely for instructing. Nor could the devotees cheaply “cheer up” their spiritual master. For Prabhupāda’s disciples to properly assist him, they would have to understand his transcendental mood and serve him accordingly. Prabhupāda wanted practical, down-to-earth service from his disciples. They should not expect to serve him sentimentally but should work hard. Devotional service was dynamic. Prabhupāda wanted his disciples to help him with his projects to serve his Guru Mahārāja – projects which, if successful, could save the world from misery.\nSometimes they were cheated. One shipment of twenty bags had been cut with other materials, and when they used it in casting a column, it remained soft for four days and finally crumbled. When at last enough cement arrived to complete the work, the devotees felt sure it had happened only because of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s presence.\nPrabhupāda had Guṇārṇava count every bag of cement as it arrived. From eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night the shipment kept coming on trucks, each truck with four coolies to carry the heavy bags on their backs into the storage shed. Guṇārṇava stood outside all day with pad and pen, marking the receipt of each bag. Śrīla Prabhupāda came out of the house several times and watched gravely. In the evening, when they were finished, he called Guṇārṇava in. “So how many bags?” Prabhupāda asked, and Guṇārṇava gave the exact figure.\n“Everything is locked away now?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\nPrabhupāda talked about the cement as if talking about a shipment of gold.\nAugust 12Prabhupāda felt very weak. It was on the afternoon of his appearance day, and he was sitting at his desk in the main room of his house. He lay down on his seat and put his head against one of the arm pillows. The following day he felt so weak he could not walk or stand. He had no appetite and ran a fever of 104 degrees. A local doctor arrived and examined Prabhupāda – malaria. He prescribed some medication, which Prabhupāda took once or twice and then refused. A second doctor came and prescribed different medicines. “Stop bringing these doctors,” Prabhupāda said. “No doctor can cure me.”\nIt was August, the monsoon season, and many devotees fell sick. When Śrutakīrti, who had recently returned to his post as Prabhupāda’s personal servant, contracted malaria, Kulādri, who had come to Vṛndāvana to attend the temple opening, volunteered to assist. Then Kulādri got malaria. Other devotees became ill with malaria, jaundice, dysentery, and various digestive problems.\nThe weather was overcast, hot and humid, and thousands of varieties of insects began appearing. For several days at a time the sky would be cloudy, the temperature in the nineties. Then the sun would come out and steam everything up with almost intolerable heat. It was Vṛndāvana’s most unhealthy season.\nAs Prabhupāda’s condition worsened, the devotees became morose and even fearful for their spiritual master’s life. They brought Prabhupāda’s bed out where it was cooler, on the small patio outside his house. His servants would massage or fan him. Days passed and Prabhupāda didn’t eat, except for a few grapes and some slices of orange. This was the way his father had died, he said – by not eating. Such remarks frightened Prabhupāda’s disciples all the more, and they began visiting thesamādhisof the Gosvāmīs to pray that Prabhupāda would be cured.\nOne evening Harikeśa stayed up all night near Prabhupāda’s room, chanting softly a continuouskīrtanaof Hare Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda liked it. “Thiskīrtana,” he said, “is what actually gives us life.” After that devotees took turns, so that there was alwayskīrtana.\nPrabhupāda explained that his illness was due to the sins of the ISKCON leaders, eighty percent of whom were not strictly following the rules and regulations, he said. Even in Vṛndāvana some of the devotees weren’t regularly rising at four A.M. Since Prabhupāda was speaking little, he had only briefly mentioned this cause of his illness. But brief as it was, it crushed his disciples. As for who was guilty, each disciple would have to say for himself. But in a mood of “Oh, God, what have we done?” all the disciples in Vṛndāvana immediately became very attentive to the rules and regulations.\nIn the morningBhāgavatamclass the devotees who lectured regularly discussed the subject as explained in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books: At the time of initiation Kṛṣṇa absolves the initiate of all karmic reactions due for past sinful acts. The spiritual master, however, as the representative of Kṛṣṇa, also shares in removing the disciple’skarma.Kṛṣṇa, being infinite, can never be affected by suchkarma,whereas the spiritual master, although completely pure, is finite. The spiritual master, therefore, partially suffers the reactions for a disciple’s sins, sometimes becoming ill. Jīva Gosvāmī warns that a spiritual master should not take too many disciples, because of the danger of accepting an overload ofkarma.Not only does the spiritual master accept the previouskarmaof the disciples, but if the disciples commit sins after initiation, then for those also the spiritual master may sometimes become ill.\nPrabhupāda said that his “misdeed” was accepting so many disciples, but he had no choice for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The spiritual master sometimes suffers, he said, so that the disciples may know, “Due to our sinful activities, our spiritual master is suffering,” and this always had a sobering effect on any would-be offender. But now, for the first time, Prabhupāda was specifically blaming his disciples for a serious illness. By neglecting their spiritual master’s most basic instructions, they were causing him great distress. They understood that their spiritual master was no ordinary malaria victim, and they knew they had to correct their mistakes and pray to Kṛṣṇa that Prabhupāda would get better.\nPrabhupāda’s condition was so critical and the implications of his statements so broad that his secretary, Brahmānanda Swami, thought it best to notify the entire International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Because Prabhupāda was pleased by the twenty-four-hourkīrtana,Brahmānanda Swami thought that this program might be introduced in every ISKCON temple in the world. A few telegrams were sent, and word quickly spread that every temple should hold continuouskīrtana,petitioning Kṛṣṇa for Prabhupāda’s recovery.\nIt reminded some of the senior disciples of 1967, when they had stayed up all night chanting and praying for Prabhupāda’s recovery from an apparent heart attack. At that time Prabhupāda had encouraged them to chant a hymn to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva and to pray, “Our master has not finished his work. Please protect him.” Due to the sincere prayers of the devotees, Prabhupāda had said, Kṛṣṇa had saved his life. Now, in 1974, there were many more devotees than in 1967, and all of them were praying for Prabhupāda’s recovery. But now also, from what Prabhupāda had said, there were also more devotees to misbehave and cause him pain.Thatmessage – “Eighty percent of the leaders of my disciples are not following the rules and regulations; this is why I am suffering” – was not telegrammed. It was too heavy.\nPrabhupāda had come to Vṛndāvana for a celebration, but there had been none. Now he was very sick, and his servant was carrying him in his arms to and from the bathroom. Other devotees were also massaging and serving him very sincerely. And there was alwayskīrtanafor him. Meanwhile he simply depended on Kṛṣṇa and waited to get better so that he could go on with his work.\nWhile he tolerated his condition as the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, he suddenly received word that the governor of Uttar Pradesh was coming to visit him. The governor, a Muslim named Akbar Ali Khan, was traveling in the area, and Seth Bisenchand, a friend of Prabhupāda’s and the governor’s, had recommended that the governor visit the temple.\nPrabhupāda thought that perhaps the governor would agree to help the devotees, at least in such matters as getting government permission for steel and cement. Therefore, despite his failing health, he insisted that the devotees hold a reception in the courtyard, and he would personally go out and greet the governor. Lying on his back and speaking in a faint voice, he ordered a feast to be cooked and tables and chairs to be arranged in the courtyard.\nThe devotees pleaded with Prabhupāda to allow them to do everything themselves and tell the governor that Prabhupāda was very ill. “He has come,” Prabhupāda said. “I have to go out and meet him.”\nŚrutakīrti dressed Prabhupāda in a fresh silkdhotī.Prabhupāda tried to apply the Vaiṣṇavatilakato his forehead, but even that was a struggle and took more than five minutes. When they were ready to go, Prabhupāda asked his servant, “Have I put on mytilaka?”He seemed almost delirious from the fever and was unable to stand. Śrutakīrti and others carried him in a chair and placed him in the middle of the courtyard, where they had arranged several tables withprasādamand Prabhupāda’s books.\nJust before the governor’s arrival, many policemen and soldiers arrived, roping off the area, directing traffic in front of the temple, and holding people outside until the governor arrived. Guṇārṇava had rolled a long red carpet from the edge of the property into the temple courtyard, and devotees lined both sides of the carpet, chanting withkaratālasandmṛdaṅgas.When the governor arrived, Surabhi presented him with a garland. Immediately removing the garland, the governor walked down the red carpet and into the courtyard. Prabhupāda stood.\nThe devotees were amazed to see Prabhupāda standing straight and shaking the governor’s hand. Prabhupāda and the governor stood together for a while and then sat down. Except for the guests, everyone present knew that Prabhupāda was not capable of much exertion. They saw him shivering and trembling, yet trying to smile and be gracious with his guest. The devotees were in great anxiety, thinking that Prabhupāda’s life might end at any moment, and yet they took part in the sociable pretense along with their spiritual master. The governor, on invitation, gave a speech, talking about how India’s future lay in industry.\nThen Prabhupāda stood to speak, leaning against his chair. His eyes were very dark, and he was barely able to focus his vision. Although he had spoken very little for almost two weeks, he now spoke for twenty minutes, while the governor listened politely. Afterward Prabhupāda sat and honoredprasādamwith the governor and his entourage of fifteen ministers. After the governor left, the devotees carried Prabhupāda back to his room, where he collapsed with a 105-degree temperature.\nThe political guests and military escort gone, the temple site returned to its usual quiet, and the devotees resumed their softkīrtana,chanting by Prabhupāda’s bedside. Amazed at Prabhupāda’s strength and determination, they realized how little they themselves were actually putting forth in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nAfter two full weeks Prabhupāda’s fever finally broke. A great ordeal was now over. The monsoon was ending, but the same problems of temple construction persisted.\nAnd so did Prabhupāda’s determination. His disciples also felt determined, and they resolved to work through all the bureaucratic delays and slow labor conditions. Now no one was going to neglect spiritual regulation.\nPrabhupāda spoke no more about his illness, and devotees around the world were informed of his improvement; they could stop the emergencykīrtanasand go on with work as usual. Prabhupāda also resumed his usual duties regarding the temple construction.\nOne thing was clear, however: Prabhupāda was completely spiritual. And the devotees working with him had engaged in a spiritual contract, a contract based on love and trust. He was taking theirkarma,and they had promised to follow his instructions. Now, despite his disappointment in them for their failures, that contract was still in order. If he continued to give his causeless mercy, then they could carry out his orders. Otherwise they were without spiritual strength. For Prabhupāda there was never a question of not continuing. Even when he had suffered illness on his disciples’ account, he had never thought to abandon them.\nBombayFrom November 1974 through January 1975 Śrīla Prabhupāda stayed in Bombay. During this time he persistently but patiently tried to obtain the No-Objection Certificate, which would enable him to start construction of Rādhā-Rāsavihārī’s beautiful temple. His close involvement with this project impressed Girirāja and others who were dedicating their lives to Hare Krishna Land. As Śrīla Prabhupāda had written inBhagavad-gītā,“One has no goal in life save and except acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness just to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. And, while working in that way, one should think of Kṛṣṇa only: ‘I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kṛṣṇa.’ While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of Kṛṣṇa. … That order of Kṛṣṇa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.”\nTo serve in a particular project, dedicating oneself to giving the local people Kṛṣṇa consciousness, was an opportunity Śrīla Prabhupāda offered every disciple. His field was the entire world, and he was like an emperor who wanted to award vast lands to loyal sons. But his awarding of lands and projects was not for material ownership (which is always illusory) but for service to the Lord. Kṛṣṇa was the proprietor of everything; therefore a preacher could remain in a particular area of Kṛṣṇa’s domain and try to free the residents from the clutches ofmāyā.Hare Krishna Land in Bombay was one of Prabhupāda’s major plans, but it was only gradually evolving, as if Kṛṣṇa first wanted to see the devotees pass many tests of obedience to Prabhupāda’s order before allowing the project to manifest.\nAlthough ISKCON owned a half-dozen tenement buildings on the Juhu land, law prohibited them from evicting any of the tenants. But no law said that the owner could not add another story onto his buildings. So Śrīla Prabhupāda had requested Mr. Sethi, a loyal life member and a construction contractor, to build rooms on the top of at least two of the tenement buildings. Eagerly, Mr. Sethi had undertaken this order and had obtained permission for the construction.\nNow that the work was completed, the rooms were being used forbrahmacārīquarters, offices, and book storage. At last the devotees had vacated the straw huts that had been their residence from their first days on the land. This move not only relieved them from living in nasty, rat-infested quarters, but also allowed them to tear down the huts. And demolition of the huts had been a stipulation before the city would issue the NOC.\nAnother major objection from the city had been that the temple’sbhajanawould create a nuisance, and that point had to be satisfied first and foremost. When the police saw Prabhupāda’s drawing of the projected temple and hotel, they admitted that within such a big temple thekīrtanawould not create as much noise as it did at present. So they agreed to accept the master plan for Hare Krishna Land and remove their objections based on “nuisance,” provided ISKCON tear down the straw huts and widen the access road so the tenants could approach the back portion of the land. Each of these legal demands involved many detailed points of contention; it was like a long, drawn-out chess game. But Prabhupāda was experienced, cautious, and determined. He proposed to stay at Hare Krishna Land for several months to help Girirāja, Mr. Sethi, and the others.\nMeanwhile, Prabhupāda insisted that the spiritual program at Hare Krishna Land go forward unabated. Even without a permanent temple, five to seven hundred guests were coming for the Sunday feasts. Girirāja had reported to Prabhupāda that Janmāṣṭamī in Bombay had been a great success, with several thousand people coming to see the Deities and takeprasādam.\nFor Śrīla Prabhupāda, who was now accustomed to staying in places like New York or Los Angeles for a week or less, to stay in Bombay for a three-month period confirmed again that Hare Krishna Land was very dear to him. It was his special child. When danger threatened, he became alarmed and protective, and when success came, he was very proud and wanted to tell the world.\nPrabhupāda seemed satisfied that at leastsomeconstruction was always going on. He asked that Mr. Sethi build a brick wall around the property, even though parts of the wall were sometimes torn down at night byguṇḍās.“Build something,” Prabhupāda said, “even if it is just one brick, but go ahead with construction.” Just as when, in acquiring the Bombay property, Prabhupāda had understood the great value of possession even before attaining the deed, so with construction he insisted they go ahead, even without full permission. “The work must begin,” Prabhupāda said, “whether you have got sufficient men and bricks or not. Begin even little, little, so it can be understood that we have begun.”\nPrabhupāda followed his invitation to the governor with a letter to Surabhi in Vṛndāvana.\nInvitations were coming in for Śrīla Prabhupāda to travel to different places, and another world tour was developing. Prabhupāda wrote to Hṛdayānanda Goswami, who was inviting him to visit Mexico City and Caracas.\nDuring February and March of 1975, Śrīla Prabhupāda toured widely again, traveling eastward via Tokyo and Hawaii to Los Angeles. While traveling, he received word that Governor Reddy had accepted the invitation to attend the Vṛndāvana temple opening on Rāma-navamī. He also received an encouraging report from Surabhi, assuring him that this time the temple opening would definitely take place. “I am encouraged that you expect to have everything completed on time,” Prabhupāda wrote. “This I want.”\nPrabhupāda traveled to Mexico City and Caracas. Again, in answering his mail, he was saying he would soon meet everyone in Vṛndāvana. To an Indian life member who wrote him for advice in touring foreign temples, he wrote,\nLeaving South America, Prabhupāda moved quickly, stopping in Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, and New York – all within a month of his departure from India. He then went to London, stopped in Tehran, and returned to India on March 16. It was Prabhupāda’s eighth trip around the world in ten years.\nEarly in the morning of March 23, Śrīla Prabhupāda left the Calcutta temple for Māyāpur, traveling in a caravan of five cars. Prabhupāda was in the first car, three following cars carried hissannyāsīdisciples, and the last car carried his sister, Bhavatāriṇī, and other ladies. As usual, Prabhupāda asked to stop at the mango orchard.\nDaivī-śakti dāsī:They all sat around together, just like cowherd boys, Prabhupāda in the center taking his breakfast fruits. It wasEkādaśī,and I had made a cake for Prabhupāda out of dates and coconut – very fancy. When Prabhupāda opened histiffinand saw it, he said, “Oh, what is this? Who has made this?” So Acyutānanda Swami told him I had madeit,and he started eating it right away. Prabhupāda said he liked it. Then they washed their hands, and we were on our way again to Māyāpur.\nMāyāpurMarch 23, 1975For this year’s festival, almost five hundred devotees from around the world had gathered, and Prabhupāda – while taking his morning walks in the nearby fields, while entering the temple of Rādhā-Mādhava, or while lecturing from theCaitanya-caritāmṛta –was the central attractive feature. Each morning after giving the class, he would circumambulate the temple room, followed by his disciples. A brass bell hung from the ceiling on either side of the Deities’ altar, and Prabhupāda, while circumambulating the Deities, would go up to one of the bells and ring it several times, pulling the rope while thekīrtanacontinued wildly. Then, with cane in hand, he would walk around the back of the Deity altar and emerge on the other side to ring the other bell.\nThe devotees would jump up and down close around him, singing Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Smiling with great pleasure, Prabhupāda would continue the length of the temple room, past the pictures of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, Gaurakiśora dāsa Bābājī, and Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, then come around and up the other side of the temple room to the first bell again and strongly ring it. After half a dozen such blissful circumambulations, he would leave the temple, while thekīrtanacontinued to roar. Coming out into the bright morning sunshine, he would walk up the broad staircase to his room.\nOn at least two occasions during that festival, Prabhupāda became stunned in trance while delivering the morning lecture. One time he was speaking in appreciation of the sacrifice of his disciples, who had spent so much money and come so far from their homes in America, Europe, and Australia to render service and attend the festival in Māyāpur. “You are all young,” he was saying. “You have a good opportunity. But I am an old man. I have no opportunity.”\nAnd with these words he suddenly fell completely silent. Such silence before five hundred disciples produced a feeling of suspended time. Everyone waited. Finally, one of the devotees began chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and Śrīla Prabhupāda returned to external consciousness, uttering, “Hare Kṛṣṇa.” He told the devotees, “Havekīrtana,” and went to his room.\nBy insisting on the devotees’ participation in the annual India pilgrimage, Prabhupāda was solidifying the spiritual basis of ISKCON, his transcendental institution. To gather his devotees like this was the reason he had prayed and struggled to erect centers in thedhāmas.He wanted to extend the purifying shelter of Māyāpur and Vṛndāvana to all his followers, now and in the future. Bit by bit, the plan was coming together; the whole world was being saved by Lord Caitanya’s movement.\nVṛndāvanaApril 16When Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived to finally conduct the Krishna-Balaram Mandir opening, he was pleasantly surprised to see the three tall domes rising over the temple. The domes had been constructed entirely during the eight months since his last visit. The four-story international guesthouse had also been completely built during his absence. Surabhi had supervised workers in day and night shifts to get everything done on time.\nThe tall central dome and two side domes, one over each altar, were magnificent. Their graceful form led the mind to higher thoughts and suggested an existence beyond the material world. The strength and beauty of the domes reminded one that beneath resided the Deity of the Supreme Lord. A temple was to enlighten people, to remove their nescience, and the domes eloquently spoke of this purpose. They could be seen for miles, rising boldly above the landscape of Vṛndāvana, proclaiming the worship of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma.\nEach dome was topped by a copperkalaśaconsisting of three balls (representing the lower, middle, and higher planets), and at the top, the eternal Sudarśanacakra,the spinning wheel-weapon of Lord Viṣṇu. The Sudarśanacakrawas Kṛṣṇa Himself, and just to see this glorious symbol atop themandiramade the devotees feel victorious and satisfied. Even the guests could not help but regard it with awe. Atop the Sudarśanacakraswere copper victory flags.\nAs Prabhupāda toured the completed building, he continually looked up at the domes. “Oh,” he said, “the domes have come out very nice. What do you think?” He turned to the devotees accompanying him.\n“They are magnificent!” said Haṁsadūta.\n“Yes, Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, “I think that Surabhi has done a nice job.”\n“Yes.” Prabhupāda smiled. “Everyone is telling how nice Surabhi is doing.” Prabhupāda turned to Surabhi, who had gone with little sleep for weeks. “But I can’t say that. Only me – I am criticizing you, because that is my job. I have to always criticize the disciple.”\nNo less than six hundred devotees from ISKCON centers around the world had come to Vṛndāvana as part of the annual Indian pilgrimage. The high point was to be the installation of the Deities and the opening of the temple. Final preparations were going furiously – cleanups, decorations, cooking. Many important life members and guests had come and were staying in their private rooms in the forty-room guesthouse. Prabhupāda’s vision had finally come to pass. He had created probably the most beautiful and opulent temple in Vṛndāvana – certainly the one most alive with dynamic devotion and preaching spirit – and along with it he had built one of the best local hotels, for visitors with an eye forkṛṣṇa-bhakti.\nTouring the grounds, Prabhupāda walked into the sunken courtyard, its marble floor clean and dazzling. This was no rented house in America, something built for another purpose – it was a temple, like the temples in Vaikuṇṭha described in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.“It is heaven on earth,” Prabhupāda said. “I think it surpasses all the temples in India.”\nPrabhupāda stood smiling before thetamālatree, its venerable branches spread throughout one corner of the courtyard, and he recounted how there had been a discussion of cutting it down and he had prevented it.Tamālatrees are associated with the pastimes of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and are very rare. In Vṛndāvana there were perhaps only three: one here, one at Seva-kuñja, and one in the courtyard of the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. That thetamālatree was growing so luxuriantly, Prabhupāda said, indicated that the devotees were performing genuinebhakti.\nConvinced that the temple was actually ready, Prabhupāda entered his residence, just between the temple and the guesthouse. Many details demanded his attention, and many visiting disciples were present.\nThus in Ramaṇa-reti, in a place where there was no temple, a pure devotee desired, “Let there be a temple, andsevā,devotional service.” And what had once been an empty lot was now a place of pilgrimage. Such is the power of the desires of the pure devotee.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda would often say of his devotional service in India, “Vṛndāvana is my residence, Bombay is my office, and Māyāpur is where I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”\nBombay is the biggest commercial city in India. Prabhupāda’s “business” was pure devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, and in Bombay he dealt more with the managerial aspects of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in India. He had incorporated ISKCON in India with the main branch in Bombay. All other branches of ISKCON in India, therefore, were legally part of the Bombay incorporation. In Bombay, Prabhupāda had cultivated more lawyers and businessmen as life members and earned more friends of his Society than in any other city in India. So whenever he was in Bombay, he often sought legal advice, not just about the Bombay center but also about his other affairs in India.\nSince Bombay was a modern city with professional and office facilities on a level with many Western cities, Prabhupāda wanted to locate the Indian division of his Book Trust there, for printing Hindi translations of his books as well as English versions for the Indian market. Bombay, unlike Vṛndāvana and Māyāpur, was not adhāmabut a bustling, wealthy city. ISKCON’s biggest donors lived there. Although Śrīla Prabhupāda’s demeanor was entirely transcendental in Bombay, and his activities were often the same as elsewhere – speaking onBhagavad-gītāandŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamand worshiping the Deity – nevertheless, Prabhupāda called it his office. And though it was his office, he wanted a temple there.\n“Māyāpur,” Prabhupāda said, “is where I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Prabhupāda conceived of a temple to be built in Māyāpur that would be the grandest of all temples in his movement. He and his devotees would worship the Supreme Lord there in such a magnificent style that the whole world would be attracted to Prabhupāda’s place of worship, the Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir.\nAccording to theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,the prescribed worship for this age issaṅkīrtana,the chanting of the holy names of God.Saṅkīrtanaworship emanated from Māyāpur, the originaldhāmaof Lord Caitanya. “In the Age of Kali,” statesŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,“Lord Kṛṣṇa appears in a golden form, as Lord Caitanya, and His activity is to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. People with sufficient intelligence will worship Him in this form.” Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted to make the most wonderful worship of Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His birthplace and thus completely fulfill the predictions of the previousācāryas,who foresaw a great Vedic city rising from the plains of Navadvīpa.\nMāyāpur could also be considered Prabhupāda’s place of worship because his spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, had preached extensively there and because hissamādhiwas there. Since Śrīla Prabhupāda’s entire preaching mission was in the service of his spiritual master, he worshiped his spiritual master through preaching in Māyāpur. Māyāpur was the origin and symbol of preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because there Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda actually began thesaṅkīrtanamovement that Prabhupāda was now carrying all over the world.\nVṛndāvana is Prabhupāda’s residence. Religious people in India as well as religious scholars in the West saw Prabhupāda as a Vaiṣṇavasādhu –from Vṛndāvana. When he began his preaching in New York City, he would often introduce himself as “coming from Vṛndāvana.” “Here I am now sitting in New York,” he once said, “the world’s greatest city, but my heart is always hankering after that Vṛndāvana. I shall be very happy to return to my Vṛndāvana, that sacred place.”\nThe people of Vṛndāvana also thought of Prabhupāda as their hometown success. Upon retiring from family life in 1954, Prabhupāda had gone to live in Vṛndāvana, first at a temple near Keśī-ghāṭa and then at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. After takingsannyāsain 1959, he had continued to reside in Vṛndāvana and, when not living there, to reserve his two rooms at Rādhā-Dāmodara.\nVṛndāvana is the home of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the place of Kṛṣṇa’s childhood pastimes, the place where the six Gosvāmīs, sent by Lord Caitanya, had excavated holy places, written transcendental literature, and built temples. Any devotee could feel at home there, and thousands of Vṛndāvana’s residents carried bead bags, chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa, and wore the Vaiṣṇavatilakaand dress. Vṛndāvana belonged to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and this was still acknowledged by the residents of the present-day Vṛndāvana.\nUltimately, Vṛndāvana is revealed only to the pure devotee. Vṛndāvana is the eternal residence of all spiritual souls in their eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa. The Vṛndāvana in India is a transcendental replica of Goloka Vṛndāvana, the eternal planet where Kṛṣṇa resides in the spiritual world. The pure devotees aspire to attain to Goloka Vṛndāvana after finishing their life in this world, and Prabhupāda, therefore, as a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, naturally felt at home in Vṛndāvana. He sometimes said that if he were to become very ill, he would prefer not to go to a hospital but to simply go to Vṛndāvana and there pass his last days. To spread the glories of Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda had left Vṛndāvana, but like a traveler away from home, he always thought of returning."

        "content": "San FranciscoJuly 5, 1970\nŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA WAS attending the 1970 Ratha-yātrā in San Francisco. The day was cold and windy, and about ten thousand people had joined in Lord Jagannātha’s procession through Golden Gate Park. Śrīla Prabhupāda had danced in the street with thousands of participants during the parade, addressed a large crowd in an auditorium by the beach, and looked on as his disciples had distributed a free vegetarianprasādamfeast to thousands. But when a devotee arrived with a half-dozen advance copies of Volume One ofKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Śrīla Prabhupāda appeared especially pleased.\nSurrounded by devotees and curious festival-goers, Śrīla Prabhupāda held one of the books, admiring the front cover, with its full-color picture of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. The volume was big, almost seven-and-a-half by ten-and-a-half inches, and its dust jacket shone, silver with large bright red letters: “KṚṢṆA.” It was a transcendental wonder in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s reverent hands.\nOnlookers could barely restrain themselves from pressing in against Śrīla Prabhupāda to peer over his shoulders. And theydidn’trestrain their exclamations when Prabhupāda smiled and opened the volume. He examined the illustrations, the print, the paper, and the binding. “Very nice,” he said. He fixed his attention on a page, reading. Then he looked up and announced that this greatly valuable book,Kṛṣṇa,had just arrived and that everyone should read it. Holding one book in his hand, with the other copies stacked before him, he said that anyone who so desired should come forward and buy a copy.\nPeople began clamoring, and hands with ten-dollar bills thrust forward, while voices cried out, begging for a copy. And Prabhupāda promptly sold every book, not even keeping one for himself.\nFor the devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s selling of theKṛṣṇabook was the most spectacular event of the Ratha-yātrā festival. They pored over the purchased books in groups, discussing Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes and the effect they would have on the people of America.\nBrahmānanda told how in 1967 Prabhupāda had given away his advance copy ofTeachings of Lord Caitanyain his room at 26 Second Avenue in New York City. Just before that book had arrived, Śrīla Prabhupāda had been sitting and talking with Satyavrata, a disciple who had previously stopped coming to the temple due to petty quarreling with his Godbrothers. When the copy ofTeachings of Lord Caitanyahad arrived, Śrīla Prabhupāda had lovingly inspected it and had then offered it to Satyavrata as a gift.\nBrahmānanda had been astounded to see Śrīla Prabhupāda give away his only copy of the book. Having helped publish the book, Brahmānanda knew how painstakingly Prabhupāda had written it and how he had anxiously waited one year for the book to finally see print. Yet once it had arrived, he had immediately given it away, and to a disciple who was not even in good standing. Satyavrata had taken the book, thanked Śrīla Prabhupāda, and left, never to be seen again.\nAlthough Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted his disciples to be as eager to distribute Kṛṣṇa conscious literature as he was, none of them knew how to do it. Distributing a magazine and asking for a small donation was one thing – but a big, hardbound book? When the entire shipment ofTeachings of Lord Caitanyahad arrived in New York in April of 1967, the devotees had hired a truck, picked up the books at the dock, and unloaded them at 26 Second Avenue. They had then shipped them to ISKCON centers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Montreal, and elsewhere. And there they remained.\nSome devotees had tried placing ads in magazines and leaving books in bookstores on consignment. But the books didn’t sell. How to sell these big, hardbound books remained a mystery – until something significant happened, an accidental discovery.\nAstonished at what had happened and inspired at their success, the twobrahmacārīswent the next day with severalKṛṣṇabooks and stood in front of a grocery store. And again it happened; this time they sold two books.\nKeśava, the San Francisco temple president, phoned his G.B.C. supervisor (and brother), Karandhara, in Los Angeles to tell him what had happened. “It’s like a miracle!” Keśava exclaimed. Karandhara encouraged him to experiment further, and soon the San Francisco temple had half a dozen men going from door to door showing the books to people in their homes. When Buddhimanta began selling as many as five books in a day, the devotees in other temples, especially Los Angeles, San Diego, and Denver, wanted to follow his example. And whoever tried it and sold a book became caught up in a euphoric excitement.\nThe experience and testimonies of devotees selling Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books describe a special taste, distinct from the happiness young men might ordinarily experience by stumbling upon a sales technique and finding themselves on the verge of making a lot of money. The difference is that the devotees’ book distribution, being devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, produces an ecstasy that is transcendental, an ecstasy far beyond even the greatest material happiness.\nOrdinary business and the business of selling Kṛṣṇa conscious literature are as different as material life from spiritual life. And anyone observing spiritual life from the material point of view will not understand it. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī has compared such empirical attempts to understand the ecstasy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness with attempts to taste honey by licking the outside of the bottle.\nThe young men and women beginning to distribute books in America knew that Śrīla Prabhupāda, by giving them Kṛṣṇa consciousness, had saved them from hellish life, and they wanted to help him give Kṛṣṇa consciousness to others. And such preaching, by distributing his books, was ecstasy, spiritual ecstasy.\nBy mid-1971, the temples were selling hundreds ofKṛṣṇabooks a week. Karandhara, Prabhupāda’s Book Fund manager, began sendingsaṅkīrtananewsletters to the North American temples and to Śrīla Prabhupāda. By listing the monthly results of each temple’s book distribution, the newsletters incited competition. Karandhara’s December 1971 newsletter summed up the mood of the year and urged the devotees to increase.\nThe crowning touch to end the year’ssaṅkīrtana,however, came not from the newsletter but from Prabhupāda himself, who wrote to Keśava, the “king” ofKṛṣṇabook distribution,\nCopies of this letter went out to every ISKCON center. Prabhupāda had always given his blessings to all the devotees, but never before could anyone recall his saying a devotee would get Kṛṣṇa’s blessings “a million times over”!\nAlthough a letter from Prabhupāda usually instructed a specific devotee, the instruction often had universal application; and Śrīla Prabhupāda’s letters made clear his disciples’ top priority: book distribution.\nPrabhupāda’s ambition was to replace mundane literature with transcendental. At least in every home there should be one piece of Kṛṣṇa conscious literature, he reasoned, because if a person read only one page, his life could be turned toward perfection. “If one percent of the readers become devotees,” he wrote, “that will change the world.” Whereas mail-order advertisers were satisfied with a five-percent response, Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke of an even smaller percentage – one percent – whom he thought could become pure devotees in response to receiving a book. Lord Kṛṣṇa also confirms this inBhagavad-gītā:“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.” To make the world Kṛṣṇa conscious, therefore, would require that millions of pieces of transcendental literature be distributed.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wanted his disciples to understandwhythey should distribute his books, and he instructed them through his letters.\nHe wrote to Jayādvaita,\nTo Jagadīśa he wrote,\nPrabhupāda continued to insist that all major Kṛṣṇa conscious programs be maintained, including Deity worship, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa in public, and holding outside lectures. All programs were important. But book distribution, whenever possible, should accompany the other programs. To asannyāsīwhose main program was public lecturing, Prabhupāda wrote,\nAnd in a letter to Bhagavān dāsa in France, he stressed the same thing: “What will your three minutes preaching do? But if they buy one book, it may turn their life.”\nDuring this period of increasing book distribution, one of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s newly initiatedsannyāsīsconcocted the idea that the devotees should spend much more time studying. While visiting the New York temple, thissannyāsīopenly advocated that devotees read Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books five to eight hours daily. The temple was following a new schedule Śrīla Prabhupāda had set up, with devotees attending the morning program, going out all day for street chanting and book distribution, and returning in the evening for a class onBhagavad-gītā.But now controversy arose, and an urgent phone call was placed to Śrīla Prabhupāda in Los Angeles. When Prabhupāda heard the details from his secretary, he immediately responded.\nJanuary 1972“You should always think of new outlets for distributing my books,” Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote to Jagadīśa. And new outlets the devotees found – shopping centers, malls, parking lots. They were meeting more people than ever before.\nBy entering the malls and shopping centers, the devotees plunged into the heart of American society, meeting pious and impious, rich and poor, black and white. Book-selling was still difficult, but the devotees persevered, carrying their heavy book bags and distributing the literature they knew could solve all problems.\nThe devotees saw the shoppers as so many walking victims of the material energy, people living for sensual and mental pleasure and therefore doomed to an inauspicious death. Any serious devotee could philosophically explain fromBhagavad-gītāthe predicament of the materialist, but now they were directly witnessing this plight. And by Prabhupāda’s mercy, they were working hard to deliver the missing essence of transcendental knowledge to the bewildered souls.\nThen came the discovery of traveling from town to town to sell books. Some of thebrahmacārīsin Los Angeles had been feeling that by staying in the temple they were wasting time they could be using for book distribution. So they loaded a van withKṛṣṇabooks and went to areas where they could camp for a week, live a simpler life, and distribute books as many hours a day as they liked. This “travelingsaṅkīrtana”produced another significant increase by creating an environment wherein the men could become fully absorbed in their work. The new program spread quickly throughout the ISKCON world, and Śrīla Prabhupāda liked it.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda began saying that opening new centers was less important now that the traveling parties were combing the country. When he heard that the temple president in Vancouver had acquired a bus for traveling, he wrote,\nPrabhupāda was glad to hear that temple presidents and zonal leaders were also going out with the travelingsaṅkīrtanaparties. The Vedic concept of the commander, he said, is that he must fight in the front lines, not sit behind the scenes, sheltered. Having already witnessed how some of his leading disciples had become bogged down by managing many things, he advised them all to travel and preach, distributing literature wherever they went.\nWhen a devotee in California wrote Śrīla Prabhupāda for permission to give up married life and go on travelingsaṅkīrtana,Prabhupāda replied that to give up family life was not necessary. Lord Caitanya had taught that being asannyāsīor agṛhasthadid not matter as long as one fully served Kṛṣṇa. A householder could also sometimes travel and distribute books, with or without his wife.\nNear the end of 1972, the BBT newsletter, now compiled by Karandhara’s assistant, Rāmeśvara, reported the ever-increasing results of book distribution.\nAnother breakthrough for book distribution came at the end of 1972. The previous year devotees had taken advantage of the Christmas season by selling theKṛṣṇabook door to door, but no one had been aware just how significant the Christmas season could actually be.\nRāmeśvara:It was on December 22, 1972 that we accidentally discovered the Christmas marathon in Los Angeles. Of course, we noticed a great increase in the number of people going into the stores, and the stores were staying open sometimes until midnight. I was standing in front of a Burbank Zody’s. We were having an intense competition with prizes in Los Angeles, and it was building up to a feverish pitch.\nSo after distributing madly all day long, I had collected about $350 and had distributed 650 magazines. It was about ten o’clock at night. I was convinced this was the new world’s record in ISKCON and that nobody was possibly going to beat me this day. Even though the store was open until twelve, business had started slowing off; and I was thinking, “Maybe I should go back. Undoubtedly everyone is back already. No one has ever stayed out past eight o’clock. They’ll all be waiting up for me. I shouldn’t keep them waiting up.” So in this way my mind was convincing me to go back.\nBy eleven o’clock the store was completely dead. I got in the car and started driving back. On the way back I passed another Zody’s, called Hollywood Zody’s, on Sunset and Western. I was torn whether to stop or not, because that store was crowded and was going to be open until midnight. But I decided, “No, I’ll go back, because the other devotees will be waiting up to see how many books I distributed.” So I just kept driving.\nI finally arrived at the temple at about ten minutes to twelve, and I burst into thesaṅkīrtanaroom. But the only person there was the secretary, Madhukaṇṭha. I said, “Oh, no. Everyone went to bed?” He said, “No, nobody is back yet.” I was the first one back! That was the discovery of the first Christmas marathon. It was completely unplanned. No one had ever instructed anyone to stay out that late. We just did it spontaneously.\nFinally, at about one-thirty in the morning, all the devotees had returned, and we were all sitting around looking at thesaṅkīrtanamap. We couldn’t sleep, we were so excited to go out. We were thinking, “Where can we find plenty of conditioned souls to distribute books to?” Our noise and raucous laughter was like a drunken party, and it woke up Karandhara, who was sleeping in his office in the next room. He came stumbling in, wiping the sleep from his eyes, but when he saw us and saw what was going on, he burst out laughing and sent us all to bed, saying, “Get ready for tomorrow.” So in this way we performed the three-day marathon –  December 22, 23, and 24.\nNo one had ever distributed as many books before in the history of our movement. A big day had been considered to be somewhere between twenty-five and forty books. But we were distributing between five thousand and six thousand pieces of literature a day for a three-day period. One temple had distributed almost eighteen thousand pieces of literature in just three days.\nWhen Prabhupāda received news of the book distribution in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States, he was very pleased and amazed. Although involved with many affairs from throughout the world, he put them aside and relished the overwhelming victory of book distribution in America. Immediately he called in his personal secretary and dictated letters.\nThe same day Prabhupāda dictated a letter to Karandhara.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s letters acknowledging the Christmas marathon and assuring the devotees that they would go back to Godhead sent the book distribution movement flying into the new year with great momentum. Devotees continued to find new ways and places to distribute books. New records were constantly topping the old, and the devotees were making still higher projections for the future.\nRāmeśvara published in his February 1973 newsletter a letter from a college student who had read one of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books. ISKCON’S mail-order office was receiving hundreds of such letters a month.\nRāmeśvara went on to beat the drum ofsaṅkīrtana.\nWith increased monies coming into the Book Fund, Śrīla Prabhupāda had approved his trustees’ plans to print larger quantities of books and store them in a warehouse, making them available to the temples for distribution throughout the year. Yet keeping up with the temples’ demand for books was still difficult, even with a warehouse.\nSmall,easy-to-sell books likeBeyond Birth and Death, On the Way to Kṛṣṇa, Rāja-vidyā,andThe Perfection of Yogawere printed in the tens of thousands. Distributors would go out, carrying in their book bags a variety of books:Śrī Īśopaniṣad,Bhagavad-gītā,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,andKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,as well as an assortment of small books,Back to Godheadmagazines, and some inexpensive booklets likeKṛṣṇa, the Reservoir of PleasureandOn Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.\nTom Beaudry was living with his wife in Santa Cruz, California. After attending a festival in Berkeley celebrating Lord Caitanya’s appearance, where he chanted all day, and after reading Śrīla Prabhupāda’sBhagavad-gītā,he felt he should become Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disciple. He began chanting and trying to interest his wife and friends in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When a traveling party ofbrahmacārīsarrived to start a center in Santa Cruz, he told them he wanted to join. But they were skeptical. Then one day he showed up with a shaved head anddhotī.\nTom Beaudry:I began going out every day with the chanting party. Then gradually I began to break away from thekīrtanaparty to sell small books in shopping centers. One day I came back and one of the brahmacārīs,Sarvabhauma, criticized me. He asked me how many big books I had sold. I said, “I didn’t sell any.” He said, “How many did you bring with you?” I said, “I didn’t have any to bring with me.” “Then you’re inmāyā,” he said. “You didn’t bring any big books? How do you expect to sell them? Prabhupāda wants these big books sold.” So I thought to myself, “Gee, I must be inmāyā.”I said, “How do you sell these books?” He said, “You pray to Prabhupāda. Prabhupāda gives you the mercy.” So I thought, “Well, that makes sense. That’s how everything works in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nI went to my house. I thought about it and prayed to Prabhupāda that I could sell these big books. I prayed all evening and then took rest. In the morning I got up, and it was on my mind. So I put out one big book,Teachings of Lord Caitanya,in my bag of small books. But in the course of selling the small books, I forgot about the big book.\nSuddenly a lady came up to me and said, “What is that big book you have there?” Then I remembered Prabhupāda and my prayers, and I said, “This is theTeachings of Lord Caitanya.” I gave her the book, and she gave me three dollars. When I got back to the temple, I told the devotees how Prabhupāda had sold a book.\nPraghoṣa: Iwas coming regularly to the Detroit temple for classes in the evening, and I was doing some odd work to help the devotees prepare the temple. Every night I would be painting, and I would watch the devotees coming back fromsaṅkīrtana.They seemed very ecstatic and enlivened, and I was always a little curious about what they did out there that made them come back like this. I would be up on my ladder, painting and listening to them talk as they sat on the floor drinking hot milk. They would talk about how they had knocked on one man’s door and this had happened and then that had happened – it was very attractive to me.\nAfter I moved into the temple and had been a devotee about a week, someone asked me if I would like to go out and try distributing books. So I went out, wearing adhotīandtilakaand using a straightforward presentation, walking up to people, giving them a card and a book, telling them about the contents of the book, showing them Prabhupāda’s picture, and asking for a donation. The exhilaration I got from that was just incredible. It became extremely blissful to go out and do this. None of us could actually put a finger on why it was so ecstatic.\nWe used to lie awake at night. All thebrahmacārīsstayed in one big room, and we would lie there on the floor in our sleeping bags, whispering to each other: “What did you say to the people out there?” There would be all these different conversations going on in the room at night, with the lights out and everyone talking, trying to relate how we were presenting Prabhupāda’s books.\nJagaddhātrī-devī dasī:My first service was cleaning the temple. I was cleaning the whole temple. I would be looking out the window at the men piling into the vans getting ready forsaṅkīrtana,and I would always think that I would really like to be doing that. Finally our temple formed two traveling parties, one of men and one of women, and we went for the summer to distribute books in the fairs of Washington state. The men and the ladies used to have competition to see who could distribute the most.\nSura:I joined Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Seattle in 1973, and they sent me out on book distribution my first day. We would always hear from Los Angeles about the letters Prabhupāda was sending. Everything we heard was centered on Prabhupāda’s desire for his books to be distributed. It was by hearing this that newer devotees wanted to go out and be part of thesaṅkīrtanaparty. We wanted to be soldiers for Prabhupāda’s book distribution army.\nWe went to the Spokane Fair, and the leader of the Spokane temple wrote a letter to Śrīla Prabhupāda requesting him to come and telling him the results of our book distribution. Then we received a reply from Prabhupāda saying that he couldn’t make it but that the devotees should go to the fair and preach on his behalf. “Fulfill my mission,” Prabhupāda said, “that every man and woman in the United States gets a book.” That was just what we were waiting for – to get an order directly from Śrīla Prabhupāda that this was what pleases him. Our book distribution kept increasing, and we just thought we’d never had so much fun before. It wasn’t like austerity. Some of the devotees were thinking, “Well, it’s really hard to go onsaṅkīrtana.” We were thinking, “You must be nuts! It’s the most fun thing you can do to go onsaṅkīrtanaand sell books.” It was fun, not for sense gratification but for the soul, because of our being linked in service to our spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. I appreciated it in that way. And when I first met Praghoṣa, I could see he was really dedicated and a true lover of Prabhupāda, because he was so dedicated to pleasing Prabhupāda by distributing books.\nPraghoṣa: We were distributing in Santa Barbara, California. The area had been worked many times before, and the people were really puffed up. I went there with a couple ofbrahmacārīs.One day, after trying to distribute for about seven hours, I had only sold one book. I had never before had anything like that happen to me in my whole time as a devotee. I was really working. I never stopped. At one particular point I just couldn’t take it any more. I tried to give a book to someone, and they just cracked off to me in a really obnoxious way. I had so much desire, I was trying so hard, that when he did this it just devastated me. I just wanted to punch the guy in the nose. All my intensity came out, and I erupted into tears. I just sat down on an old telephone pole that was lying by the street and started to cry.\nThen this devotee walked up and found me sitting there like I had just lost my best friend. He said, “Prabhu, what’s the matter?” I said, “I don’t know what’s the matter. I just can’t distribute books. Not one person will take a book. I’ve been out here for seven hours. Do you know how many books I’ve distributed? One book.” Then he sat down and preached to me and put me back together.\nThe next day I was really trying to have a better day, and I took my book bag and just ran from one person to another all morning. Then I was showing a book to a girl, and she said she couldn’t pay me with money but that she would gladly pay me. I was young and naive, and I didn’t know exactly what she was talking about for a minute. Then finally when I realized, I called, “Hare Kṛṣṇa!” and took the book back from her, took off my wig and just bolted to another parking lot. I ran from person to person all day, praying real hard to Kṛṣṇa. By the end of the day I had distributed a large number of books.\nLavaṅga-latikā-devī dāsī:When I first came to Los Angeles, Śrīmatī told me that Śrīla Prabhupāda had said that being in the temple all the time wasmāyā.Prabhupāda wanted us to go out and distribute BTGs door to door. I learned from the other devotees how to distribute books. There were so many experienced devotees who knew how, so I just followed in their footsteps. I would say what they’d say and do what they’d do. Then it became easy. When a person took a book and gave a donation, I could see it was Lord Caitanya acting. I could see that everything was working under the direction of Kṛṣṇa’s internal energy.\nRāmeśvara:I remember when they came back. It was the middle ofBhagavad-gītāclass, and I was giving the class in the temple room. All of a sudden the door burst open, and they were standing there. Tripurāri was in his street clothes, and the girls were in theirsārīs.They just ran into the temple. You could see that something very special had taken place, because their faces were glowing. They couldn’t even speak. They were dazed or stunned. The whole temple was anxious to hear the news, so I quickly finished the class. Then Tripurāri told us that he had just distributed seventeenBhagavad-gītās –the full, hardbound, unabridgedBhagavad-gītās –in two hours. Līlāśakti had distributed thirteen, Vṛndāvana had distributed eleven, Tilaka had distributed eleven, and Makhana Lāl had distributed nine. Nothing like this had ever been done before. We were all completely astonished that anyone could sell so many big books like that.\nOne morning a few days later, Tripurāri was driving down the San Diego Freeway to go on travelingsaṅkīrtanawhen he saw the sign for the Los Angeles airport and spontaneously decided to try it. After selling a dozen big books that day, he realized the airport was wonderful for book distribution. He started going out regularly to the airport and was soon distributing thirty to forty books a day, sometimes giving individuals as many as six volumes ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamat once.\nApril 11, 1973Śrīla Prabhupāda flew from New York to Los Angeles, and a crowd of loving devotees greeted him.\nTripurāri:Prabhupāda was arriving at two in the afternoon, and all the devotees were going to meet him. But it was also Easter weekend and a big day for book distribution at the airport. At that time I was the only one working the airport. I was doing rather well and had sold about thirty books by one-thirty. Then I changed into mydhotīand walked over to the arrivals area to meet His Divine Grace. When he entered the terminal building, he looked at me and smiled, and I melted in ecstasy.\nWe hadkīrtanaall the way down the stairs, and when we got outside, all the devotees were going back to the temple. Then I thought, “What business do I have going back to the temple and chanting with all the devotees? My business is to stay out and distribute the books. That is my service to Prabhupāda.” So I was the only one who didn’t return to the temple. I stayed and distributed sixty-seven books. When I got back, I found that Karandhara had told Prabhupāda about me and how I had been distributing books. When I heard that, I became very enthusiastic and continued to distribute books every day that week.\nThe sun would just be appearing on the horizon as Prabhupāda and a small group of disciples walked. The air would be chilly, and Śrīla Prabhupāda would wear his hooded saffron overcoat, while his disciples, wearing sweaters or woolcādaras,followed him, listening and asking questions.\nMost of the conversation, however, would be between Prabhupāda and Dr. Singh, who played the role of a materialistic scientist. Dr. Singh would present atheistic arguments, and Śrīla Prabhupāda would defeat them with scripture and logic. “I say to the scientists,” Prabhupāda said, “if life originated from chemicals, and if your science is so advanced, then why can’t you create life biochemically in your laboratories?”\nOn one of these morning walks, the older devotees introduced Rāmeśvara to Prabhupāda, and at the devotees’ request, Rāmeśvara began telling Śrīla Prabhupāda about book distribution. He mentioned that sometimes the distributors would meet impersonalists and convince them to buy a copy ofBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda stopped and turned gravely to Rāmeśvara. “What do you say to them?” he asked.\nRāmeśvara told Prabhupāda some of his techniques for selling a book.\nAfter a few moments Prabhupāda said, “Our men need to study our books also.”\nOn the morning Tripurāri accompanied Prabhupāda on his walk, Prabhupāda said little as they walked up and down the beach. Only when they were walking back toward the car did one of the devotees mention, “Prabhupāda, Tripurāri is here.”\nPrabhupāda turned and smiled. “Ah. How is the book distribution going?” he asked.\nThis was Tripurāri’s first time to speak directly with his spiritual master, and he wanted to say many things at once. In nervous enthusiasm he began blurting out his realizations. Prabhupāda interrupted, “This is the best service for humanity.” And he quoted from theBhagavad-gītā,“There will never be a devotee more dear to Me than he who preaches this message.”\nWith the exception of Rāmeśvara’s and Tripurāri’s brief encounters with Prabhupāda, none of the book distributors in Los Angeles had any personal exchanges or meetings with their spiritual master. But the closeness of their relationship with him was not dependent on physical proximity.\nTripurāri:My association with Śrīla Prabhupāda was always more or less in separation and in the field. While many of the older devotees were trained personally by Prabhupāda, I never got that training. I was trained by Śrīla Prabhupāda more from within my own heart. I think that’s the case with all of our book distributors. They have a very intimate sense of feeling for Prabhupāda, but they never had much personal contact. Their intimacy and real sense of knowing Prabhupāda very closely was because of that service which Prabhupāda said was his life and soul – seeing that the books went out.\nFor an hour or more Prabhupāda would sit, listening to a reading fromKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,while around him on the grass, sharing the transcendental moment, sat his disciples. Prabhupāda was fully satisfied to hearkṛṣṇa-līlā,and he would sit erect, head held high, in a meditative mood. It was only an informal group, but his presence made the occasion very special, momentous. From time to time he would interrupt the reader to comment. Night would fall, and he would end the reading and leave the garden, walking on the gravel path past the main temple building and up to his second floor suite.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda so much liked his Los Angeles garden that he decided he wanted one like it at his Māyāpur headquarters.\nAt about ten in the evening Śrīla Prabhupāda would usually go into his bedroom and lie down. His servant, Śrutakīrti, would massage his legs, and Prabhupāda would then close his eyes. Meanwhile, Rāmeśvara would be waiting at the bottom of the stairs, hoping that the secretary or servant would come down with a message from Prabhupāda.\nRāmeśvara:I wastoo afraid to go into Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, so I would be waiting at the bottom of the stairs, just hanging there, just waiting for one word. Śrīla Prabhupāda would often say something, and it would be passed to me. Then every morning thesaṅkīrtanadevotees would just surround me and ask, “What did he say?” They would be begging for some nectar. It was an intense experience. We felt that we were all having a special direct connection with Prabhupāda.\nWhile waiting outside Prabhupāda’s door, I would be in transcendental bliss just thinking how we were distributing books as an offering of pure love for our spiritual master. This was the first time that devotees were going to the airports. No one else in the movement was going to an airport except the devotees in Los Angeles, so it was something very special. No one was doing big books in the quantity that we were.\nAt one point, when Śrīla Prabhupāda saw one of my dailysaṅkīrtanareports, he commented, “Who is Rāmeśvara?”\nDay after day, Śrīla Prabhupāda was seeing these ecstatic reports, sprinkled with nectarean quotes from hisCaitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlāchapter that had just been published. He realized that these disciples were in ecstasy, and so he asked, “Who are they?” He could see we lovedsaṅkīrtana.It was not an artificial burden or that we were struggling. He could see that there didn’t seem to be any struggle. It was like fun, bliss, ecstasy. And the whole philosophy was there. We were completely tuning in to theCaitanya-caritāmṛtaphilosophy that Lord Caitanya descends with His confidential associates to spread love of God but doesn’t discriminate who is a fit candidate and who is not. These were the verses we were putting into the daily letter. This was our mood, and Prabhupāda loved it.\nFrom Śrutakīrti’s point of view, the evening massage was a very special time, because Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed free of the pressure of the day’s management. Śrutakīrti would bring several night-blooming jasmine flowers from the garden, and Prabhupāda would place the fragrant blossoms near his nose during the massage. He would be even quieter and more relaxed than during theKṛṣṇabook reading. There was no business to attend to; he had done a hard day’s work. Although he would be rising after only three hours’ rest, he now lay back, enrapt in thought or chanting softly.\nSome evenings Śrīla Prabhupāda would delay the massage and slowly walk back and forth in his bedroom, chanting on his beads, or he would sit on his bed and chant. But on most nights he would lie on his back, while Śrutakīrti massaged his legs. If he conversed with his servant at all, it wouldn’t be about ISKCON management. He might look at a picture on the wall and say, “How beautiful Kṛṣṇa is! How could they not be attracted to Kṛṣṇa?” Or sometimes he would talk about his childhood and other informal topics. But even at this relaxed time, he relished hearing thesaṅkīrtanaresults, and so he would sometimes read Rāmeśvara’s daily report or simply say something about preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nOne night, after reading Rāmeśvara’s ecstatic dailysaṅkīrtanareport, Prabhupāda felt moved to write a message on the back of the report. Dating the paper April 20, 1973, he wrote,\nRāmeśvara may have been shy while quietly waiting at the bottom of the stairs for the slightest recognition from Śrīla Prabhupāda, but when he received the prize jewel of this handwritten note, he ran off, shouting to share the good fortune with any devotee who was still awake.\nTripurāri:Every morning aftermaṅgala-āratithere was always a little group clustered around the door of the temple, because you weren’t supposed to talk in the temple while chantingjapaearly in the morning. So Rāmeśvara was standing at the doorway chanting, and he called us over, until a little cluster of devotees were there at the doorway. He showed us Prabhupāda’s note. Some of the other devotees got frustrated, seeing that we were talking during thejapaperiod. They felt we were a distraction or that we weren’t absorbed in our service or injapa.But actually we were really intensely absorbed in thinking ofsaṅkīrtana,and when we returned to ourjapa,we began chanting with the desire to be able to go out and please Prabhupāda.\nIn a few days Prabhupāda’s words – “Everyone should go with the Sankirtan Party as soon as possible” – reached the other temples. And although Śrīla Prabhupāda soon left Los Angeles, returning to India, his message stayed and deepened the devotees’ convictions.\nIn the summer of 1973 the devotees found that at concerts they could distribute hundreds ofKṛṣṇabooks in a few hours. TheKṛṣṇabook, available now as a paperback trilogy with a foreword by George Harrison, was especially attractive to young people. In July, Rāmeśvara wrote to Prabhupāda in London, telling him that the Los Angeles temple was distributing two thousandKṛṣṇabooks a week and that at one concert devotees had distributed six hundred books in two hours.\nThe devotees in Los Angeles decided that Tripurāri and a few other leadingsaṅkīrtanamen should travel from temple to temple and share their experience. Rāmeśvara wrote to Prabhupāda, “This is the mercy of Sri Sri Rukmini-Dvarakadhisa [the Deities of the L.A. temple] that we can send out so many devotees to other centers. It is the real opulence of New Dvārakā.” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied on August 3.\nA letter from a woman who had recently received some of Prabhupāda’s books appeared in the July BBT newsletter. The letter had been written on TWA in-flight stationery.\nOn her way back from London she had purchased another book,Rāja-vidyā,in the Chicago airport and now asked for more help. “It is beautiful,” she concluded.\nOne day in September 1973, during Śrīla Prabhupāda’s morning walk on Juhu Beach in Bombay, a few of hissannyāsīdisciples brought the matter before him. Prabhupāda referred to the many gentlemen strolling along Juhu Beach who would always offer respects to the devotees by folding their hands and saying, “Hare Kṛṣṇa.” This was the sign of a real Vaiṣṇava, Śrīla Prabhupāda said: anyone who sees him immediately thinks of Kṛṣṇa. The devotees, therefore, should prominently display such Vaiṣṇava markings astilaka, śikhā,and neck beads, so that people could know, “Here are Hare Kṛṣṇa people.”\nOnesannyāsīremarked that in America devotees were now wearing wigs and dressing like hippies to distribute books. He did not let his own men do this because he felt it self-defeating if people didn’t even know they were speaking to a devotee. If someone wanted to distribute books, he concluded, Kṛṣṇa would help that devotee find a place where he could do so without having to disguise himself.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda turned to the others, asking their opinions. One devotee suggested that the reason the devotees in America wore “disguises” was because otherwise they would not be permitted to distribute books in certain places. Prabhupāda heard the opinions and then gave his decision: these disguises should be stopped immediately. “We shall not in any way sacrifice our standards,” he said. “We must maintain our principles strictly. This dressing with long hair andkarmīclothes is the tendency to once again become hippies. Because you were hippies, that tendency is still there. So this should be stopped.”\nWalking back toward the temple, Prabhupāda saw a poor man evacuating by the roadside in public view. “He is not changing his standard, despite public opinion,” Prabhupāda said. “Can we not maintain our standards as strictly as they are maintaining theirs?”\nA letter was drafted and signed by Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, Prabhupāda’s secretary, and Prabhupāda signed also, on a line marked “approved.” The letter stated that allsaṅkīrtanadevotees should always weartilaka, dhotīs,neck beads, andśikhā,and should depend on Kṛṣṇa rather than disguises to help distribute books. At the bottom of the letter, however, was a P.S. – “Śrīla Prabhupāda, upon checking the above, added, ‘If they like, they may wear coat and pants… But tilak, sikha, beads – these things should be there.’ ” Previously Śrīla Prabhupāda had addressed this subject in various letters. To Jagadīśa in Canada Prabhupāda had replied that there was no objection to wearing Western clothes, including a wig or hat. “We have to take whatever is favorable position for executing Kṛṣṇa consciousness,” Prabhupāda had written. “Sometimes we may adopt such means in order to help distribute books.” But in February 1973 he had written to Rūpānuga that he did not want devotees dressing as hippies.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda preferred to be spared such detailed management. His G.B.C. men should consult among themselves and then present their conclusions to him for a final decision. “In this way,” Prabhupāda had written, “I will be free to concentrate on my translation ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.”\nThe letter from India reached Karandhara in Los Angeles, but before announcing that allsaṅkīrtanain Western clothes must be stopped, he wanted Prabhupāda to hear his side of the story. He gave an elaborate report on the benefits of devotees’ wearing ordinary Western dress while selling books. The main thing Prabhupāda seemed to be objecting to, he concluded, was a disreputable appearance – devotees looking like hippies. He now informed Prabhupāda that the distributors were actually clean, well groomed, and presentable. If the book distributors were restricted to appearing in public with shaved head anddhotī,he said, then the distribution would decline by about two thirds. “If extremes and misapplications have occurred,” he wrote, “they should be worked out rather than giving up the whole program.”\nThis time Śrīla Prabhupāda replied in favor of Western dress.\nThe book distributors were protective of Prabhupāda’s order that as many books as possible be distributed. Just because a few people had complained, they argued, was no reason to cool down book distribution. They quoted Śrīla Prabhupāda’s statements that opposition tosaṅkīrtanaindicates its purity and genuineness.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had explained this point in his books in discussing the historical incident of Lord Caitanya’ssaṅkīrtanaparties’ being stopped by the Muslim government. Prabhupāda had written,\nPeople in America had also objected to public chanting, to the devotees’ dress, to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy, to the food. Someone would always oppose. The main thing, the book distributors said, was to save the conditioned souls, who were heading for a hellish next life. If a person got a book and read just one page, his life could be changed.\nOther devotees, however, including temple presidents, were disturbed by the complaints. Someone recalled that Prabhupāda had already addressed this point in 1970.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wanted the book distributors to execute his order, but he was not giving them a license to do anything and everything and claim it was for Kṛṣṇa. Preaching required expertise, not only in getting people to take a book but in giving them the right impression.\nThe book distributors maintained that they were doing the best they could but that they would try to improve. If other devotees thought they could do better, then they should demonstrate how to distribute books without disturbing anyone. Distributing books all day, day after day, was hard. People were already agitated by their minds and senses and harassed by their occupations, governments, and personal relationships. No wonder even an innocent devotee sometimes disturbed them.\nThe tactics in question were mostly the book distributors’ lines. The distributors would say that they were students, that they were helping get young people off drugs, or that the books were about how to solve modern day crises. None of these things were untrue, but the emphasis was sometimes excessive.\nA mature devotee could speak more directly. Tripurāri would tell how the books described an ancient civilization in which people knew how life should be lived. He would present himself as a representative of an organization that had communities all over the world where people could benefit from the example of an alternative life-style. Tripurāri and others were able to be both personal and, in a casual way, philosophical, as they spoke about spiritual life. They made quick friends with strangers and convinced them to take books. But more and more devotees were taking up book distribution and many were inexperienced.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s philosophy was clear, but different interpretations persisted. Without referring to specific techniques, Prabhupāda simply stressed the purity of book distribution and encouraged the book distributors to continue without interruption; the main thing was to distribute books.\nDevotees continued to press Śrīla Prabhupāda for further clarification. The book distributors were concerned that the urgency of book distribution not be minimized, whereas other responsible ISKCON leaders were concerned that loose practices might hamper the Society’s progress. Prabhupāda replied to questions by Bali-mardana of New York with a letter that became particularly influential.\nPrabhupāda’s position was clear: the books should be sold, but expertly. And lest there be any doubt, Prabhupāda reiterated that the book distribution was the best preaching. “The success of your preaching will be substantiated by how many books are sold.” Prabhupāda also wrote, “The art is to sell many, many books and not to irritate the public.”\nAs books continued to go out by the millions, many people expressed their thanks on receiving a book. Only occasionally would someone complain. But within ISKCON, the dialogue regarding book distribution techniques continued. When Śrī Govinda, the president of ISKCON Chicago, wrote Prabhupāda, Prabhupāda encouraged him in his attempt to reform the devotees engaged in excessive practices.\nNovember 1973Scores of men and women were going out every day to distribute books. One November day the devotees of the New York City temple broke the ISKCON world record by distributing 13,200 pieces of literature. On the same day they also distributed 15,000 pieces ofprasādam.The ISKCON total for 1973 was 4,169,000 books sold. When Śrīla Prabhupāda received these figures, he replied to Rāmeśvara,\nThe year 1974 began with what appeared to be a serious setback. The Supreme Court ruled against Vietnamese war protestors’ distributing political leaflets in private malls. Citizens of nonprofit groups – religious included – could solicit on private property only with permission from the proprietor. The malls that the book distributors had frequented were suddenly off limits.\nThe same constitution that barred the devotees from private property, however, gave them access to public property, and when ISKCON devotees filed a lawsuit against the city-owned Las Vegas airport, they won an immediate injunction on the basis that the airport was denying them their right to free speech. This ruling promised to open a new era in book distribution, with possibilities of legalizingsaṅkīrtanain all major airports.\nDevotees saw this as proof that Kṛṣṇa was working through Prabhupāda to increase book distribution. No previous spiritual master had ever distributed Vedic literature on so great a scale. This was another sign that Śrīla Prabhupāda was Kṛṣṇa’s empowered representative. And by the devotees’ efforts to follow Prabhupāda’s order, Kṛṣṇa was empowering them also. But only if they were willing to go through the trials of surrender and renunciation.\nPraghoṣa:I went out one day to the airport, and I walked up to one black man and said, “Excuse me, sir.” And BAM! He punched me right in the face and knocked me down. At that moment so many thoughts went through my mind. I could just hear Tripurāri’s words ringing in my ears from the class that morning: “We must be determined. …” So I just said to myself, “Well, I’ll just stand right back up and keep trying.” I stood up, and I got the inspiration to just turn around and try to hand the next person one of Prabhupāda’s books.\nAnother time a husband and wife approached me, but the husband didn’t want anything to do with me. When the woman saw that the book was spiritual, she stopped and said, “What’s this book about?” I said very bluntly, “This book explains birth and death and what’s beyond.” She said, “Oh.” Then she turned to her husband and said, “Please buy it.” But he said, “I don’t want it. Come on, let’s go.” She said, “Please!” But her husband said, “You buy it.” And he walked off.\nSo she stayed with me and said, “Could you tell me a little more about this?” I started to explain the book, and then I said, “Where are you coming from?” She said, “I’m coming from Rochester.” Then she revealed to me that she was coming from the Mayo Clinic and that she had terminal cancer and was going to die. She said, “I desperately want to read this book.” She gave me ten dollars and said, “Thank you very much.” Then she took the book and ran off.\nA little later she came back and found me and shook my hand and thanked me. These kind of experiences that devotees would have day in and day out gave us the feeling of being like emissaries or representatives of something very special. By this we became more attached to Śrīla Prabhupāda and to executing his work. We would see these miracles take place.\nKeśava Bhāratī:I used to distribute books in the San Francisco airport. I thought that this airport was particularly difficult and that if I could be in L.A. I could probably distribute as many books as Tripurāri. I was a little proud. Then I got the chance to distribute with him.\nI am very outgoing and gregarious, so I don’t have any problem stopping people or anything like that. But half an hour and then an hour went by, and Tripurāri had distributed five and then ten books. But I couldn’t get anybody to stop and shake my hand even. It was incredible! But I knew it was because I was too proud. Another hour went by, and still no one would stop and shake my hand. I was bewildered, because I wanted to pass out Prabhupāda’s books. Finally I just sat down out of frustration. I was nearly crying.\nTripurāri came up and preached to me. He told me I should pray to Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda in times like this and not to worry about it, that this happens. So I got it together, and then about ten to fifteen people in a row came and talked with me, and some of them took books. So when we discussed it afterward, we could understand that we were just instruments in Lord Caitanya’s hands. This is how we developed thesaṅkīrtanaphilosophy. Through the book distribution we came to realize who Prabhupāda was and to appreciate him more.\nLavaṅga-latikā:All day I would stand at the top of the stairs, and thousands and thousands of people would come by. And we would distribute hundreds and hundreds of books. We used to take lines from Prabhupāda’s books. Tripurāri used to talk about the swans’ taking milk from water. So we used to use that a lot in approaching someone. We’d say how these great sages used to know how to separate milk from water, separate the essence. He also said the pictures were windows to the spiritual world. We’d say, “This book is like the brilliant sun that will drive away the darkness of ignorance in this Age of Kali.”\nI found the best way to distribute the books was to use Prabhupāda’s own words. Prabhupāda said if we read one line to someone, that person can make one hundred times spiritual advancement. One time a devotee complained to Prabhupāda that people were throwing some of the books away. But then we could understand that Prabhupāda wanted them distributed on a large scale. Not that you kept the book for a special person you thought might be intelligent enough to read it. Because Prabhupāda said that if they read only one line they would be very much affected. So we could understand that Prabhupāda wanted mass distribution, not that we just keep them for the special, right person.\nSura:Vaiśeṣika was selling books in the airport with me. He would walk up to people and say, “Well, how are you doing, sir? All glories to the Śrī Kṛṣṇasaṅkīrtanamovement, the prime benediction for humanity at large, which cleanses the heart.” He was repeating theŚikṣāṣṭakaprayers of Lord Caitanya right out of the book, and yet he was selling books. The books had pictures of Kṛṣṇa and devotional scenes on the cover, and sometimes some devotees couldn’t understand how people could relate to these books. But Prabhupāda wanted them distributed. And he was saying that we should preach on the merit of the book. When a devotee asked Prabhupāda what we should say to distribute the books, Prabhupāda repliedkṛṣṇe sva-dhāmopagate,which is the verse that says theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamis as brilliant as the sun and it has arisen just to give people religion in this age of darkness. So we were also repeating that verse and distributing books on faith.\nWe would go out and see the people actually becoming struck by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They would see that the devotees were very sincere and serious, and they would become impressed. Daily onsaṅkīrtanawe would see people appreciating Prabhupāda’s books. There was also harassment, but Prabhupāda had talked about it, that there was always difficulty. So everything was there from Prabhupāda to confirm whatever realizations we had. Śrīla Prabhupāda said a book salesman would sometimes have difficulty because he’ll be sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected. But he tolerates.\nIn the airport we met professors, lawyers, all kinds of people who would stop and talk. They would challenge, and we would constantly have to defend Prabhupāda’s books and his movement and speak up on behalf of Prabhupāda, more so than when we were just kids out on the parking lots talking to women and begging fifty cents for a pack of incense. We were presenting Prabhupāda’s books to the scholars, coming into contact with Māyāvādīs, scientists, businessmen, people who were very sharp, in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and San Diego. People there were very sharp and hard. And just by having to spiritually combat them and defend the movement, we became more mature in our understanding of Prabhupāda’s books and how to present them in such a way that we could convince even people who didn’t want to be convinced. We had to study Prabhupāda’s books.\n“Your entire program is approved by me,” Prabhupāda wrote to Tripurāri. When Tripurāri asked if he could takesannyāsa,Prabhupāda replied that he was already doing more than anysannyāsī.In one letter Prabhupāda called him “the incarnation of book distribution.”\nBook distribution took another great stride forward when Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s zonal secretary in India for four years, returned to the U.S. Joining with his friend Viṣṇujana Swami, he helped form the Rādhā-Dāmodarasaṅkīrtanaparty, traveling in a bus with Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities to distribute books and hold festivals all over the U.S.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami:When we first began the Rādhā-Dāmodara party our idea was to make as many devotees as possible by holding festivals at which we chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa and distributedprasādam.After Kṛṣṇa sent so many nice young men it was difficult to keep them always engaged. Then suddenly a letter arrived from Śrīla Prabhupāda in which he said that thekīrtanaof book distribution was better than thekīrtanaof public chanting. This transcendental instruction changed the course of our Rādhā-Dāmodara party. From then on I concentrated more and more on book distribution, and this gave Prabhupāda greater and greater pleasure. I had been in India for four years, but our main program had been enrolling life members. But now that I was in America Śrīla Prabhupāda was reminding me that preaching meant to distribute his books. So I became inspired that our party should distribute so many books that it equal all of the other book distribution of the rest of ISKCON worldwide. Day and night I was thinking of how to get out more and more books and thus overflood America with transcendental literature. Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote me that this was his real ambition, to turn all of America into Vaiṣṇavas.\nUntil we formed our Rādhā-Dāmodara party, the method of distributing books had been that an individual would be given either a large, medium, or small book, according to the size of the donation. But Prabhupāda told me that of all types of book distribution, to distribute his large books was most important. So I was always considering how to increase the number of large books. The problem was that people were willing to give small donations, but rarely would they give us large enough contributions to award giving them a large book. Then Kṛṣṇa gave me the idea that by adding together a few small donations from a number of persons, at least one of them could be given a large book, while the others could be given aBack to Godheadmagazine or a small book. By this method we were able to increase the distribution of big books tremendously. Prabhupāda fully approved of this idea. As long as the Book Fund received payment for the books, Śrīla Prabhupāda allowed us to pass them out as quickly as we could, irrespective of the size of donation. Thus our Rādhā-Dāmodara party was able to distribute as many as fifty thousand big books in a single month.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda showed special interest in the Rādhā-Dāmodara party and approved loans from the BBT for the purchase of more buses, thus creating asaṅkīrtanaarmy traveling in renovated Greyhound buses. By the end of 1974 the Rādhā-Dāmodara party had three buses, vans, and numerous men. Prabhupāda called the buses “moving temples,” and he urged the Rādhā-Dāmodara devotees to continue their program, with certainty that they were pleasing Lord Caitanya. “I am glad that you have understood the importance of my books,” Prabhupāda wrote, “therefore I am stressing it so much. Let everyone take these books.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda encouraged the Rādhā-Dāmodara party to expand to hundreds of buses and thus fulfill the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to every town and village. When a tight transcendental competition arose between the Los Angeles temple, Tripurāri’s BBT party, and the Rādhā-Dāmodara party, Prabhupāda watched and approved it with pleasure.\nAnother party forming in 1974 was the BBT library party. It began with Hṛdayānanda Goswami’s sending somebrahmacārīsfrom his traveling party to visit prestigious universities in New England. The men attempted to sell entire sets of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books to the professors, and even in their first attempts they met with great success.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had long cherished this idea, and even before coming to America he had gone to libraries in India with copies of hisŚrīmad-BhāgavatamFirst Canto. By his efforts in New Delhi, the United States Library of Congress had obtained copies of those early volumes. Now his desire to see his books placed in all the U.S. libraries and universities was becoming a reality. Within a few months professors began writing favorable reviews, and some even ordered Prabhupāda’s books for their college courses. “I very much like this program of the standing orders,” Prabhupāda wrote. “Try to increase it up to fifty thousand such orders from the libraries.”\nAnother party that formed in 1974 was Nāma-haṭṭa, a group ofbrahmacārīsled by twosannyāsīs.The Nāma-haṭṭa party would travel and distribute books, donating their profits toward Śrīla Prabhupāda’s projects in Bombay, Māyāpur, and Vṛndāvana.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda recovered his health, and by the end of 1974 his BBT was also in extraordinary health, with the temples again competing in a furious Christmas marathon. In America, the BBT reported to Prabhupāda that approximately 387,000 hardbound books had been sold during the year, a 67% increase over the previous year. And almost 4,000,000Back to Godheadshad been sold, an 89% increase. The American BBT sold the individual temples a total of 6,668,000 pieces of literature, a 60% increase.\nSuch news made Śrīla Prabhupāda “become energetic like a young man,” and Prabhupāda and his book distribution movement headed into 1975 with all signs of increasing – doubling and tripling – the already astounding figures of 1974.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had created his Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in 1972 as an independent entity to insure that his books could continue being produced and distributed. The BBT would operate exclusively for the benefit of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and yet it would exist independently.\nThe trust document stated that the trustees should divide the money from the sale of the books to ISKCON temples into two funds: one for printing books and one for purchasing ISKCON properties and building temples. Prabhupāda believed that if this fifty-fifty formula were followed, Kṛṣṇa would assure the success of ISKCON. Repeatedly he would refer to this formula in conversations and letters, even in his purports onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda gave his BBT trustees authority to make printing plans, and the trustees would then consult him for approval. He would set the standards and guidelines for his BBT trustees to follow. Only after consulting him could they institute changes.\nAnd to changes Prabhupāda was particularly averse. He would choose the book size, determine the artwork, and make suggestions about the size of a particular printing, about shipping policies, about sales to temples – about almost every aspect of the BBT’s publishing activities. Even when certain temples did not remit their payments to the BBT, Prabhupāda would become involved.\nHe was a strict manager. “According to Vedic instruction,” he said, “fire, debt, and disease should never be neglected. They must be extinguished by all means.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda saw book distribution as (among other things) the basis for an economically sound ISKCON. Other businesses could also operate, but book-selling was the best, for it combined preaching with a good source of income. As he wrote to one of his temple presidents,\nAnd on another occasion,\nŚrīla Prabhupāda also oversaw all BBT loans to temples; any G.B.C. secretary or temple president requesting a loan would have to approach him. In 1973 and 1974 he granted sizable loans for building, purchasing, or improving temples in Dallas, Hawaii, Sydney, Chicago, and Vancouver. He also granted a loan to the Rādhā-Dāmodara party for buying “traveling temples,” or buses, and one to South America for printing books. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja automatically received a fifty-thousand-dollar loan each year for New Vrindaban. But Prabhupāda would deny money requests for projects he considered inconsistent with the purposes of the BBT. On November 6 he wrote to Rāmeśvara,\nBeginning in 1974, Śrīla Prabhupāda utilized the BBT profits for constructing his main temples in India – Vṛndāvana, Māyāpur, and especially Bombay. Rāmeśvara informed the devotees of this special function of the BBT.\n“These places in India,” Prabhupāda wrote, “are spiritually potent. By establishing temples in Māyāpur and Vṛndāvana we assure that the purity of our movement will be kept intact.”\nWhen in early 1973 a German edition ofBhagavad-gītāhad been printed, Śrīla Prabhupāda had written Haṁsadūta, “You have done the right thing by printingBhagavad-gītāin German language, and I very much appreciate that you have done this great service.” By the summer,saṅkīrtanaparties had been traveling throughout Germany, distributing several hundred copies ofBhagavad-gītāa week. Haṁsadūta had promised that he would translate one book a month into German, and when in the fall of 1974 Prabhupāda heard of six recently printed German translations, he replied, “This is very happy news for me. Thank you. Overflood Europe with German books.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that whenever he published a book he felt that he had conquered an empire. His books were the basis of the spiritual revolution that would eventually change humanity and save it from the pernicious effects of the Age of Kali.\n“Produce voluminously Spanish language literature,” Śrīla Prabhupāda requested. When Hṛdayānanda Goswami had become the zonal leader for South America, Śrīla Prabhupāda had instructed him to emphasize printing and distributing books above opening temples. “I also was printing even before I had big temples in the U.S.,” Prabhupāda had written. “So you may follow the footsteps of the previousācāryas.”\nHṛdayānanda Goswami had organized a Spanish BBT in Mexico and had made book distribution his priority. Early in 1974, when the Spanish BBT was ready to print translations ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam’sfirst volume,Bhagavad-gītā,andKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Prabhupāda wrote,\nWhen one hundred thousand copies of a SpanishBack to Godheadwere printed, Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote, “Now give them to everyone.” Spanish book distribution became the second largest in the world, next to American.\nBhagavān, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s representative in southern Europe, had been printing in French and Italian, and as early as December 1972 he had printed Prabhupāda’sEasy Journey to Other Planetsin French. By the beginning of 1974, three parties in France were distributing daily one thousand books, including a FrenchBhagavad-gītāAs It Is. Already Bhagavān had printed the first ItalianBack to Godhead,and a FrenchŚrī Īśopaniṣadwas forthcoming.\nWherever devotees went, they knew their program was to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, follow the regulative principles, and arrange for printing and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books. When the first devotees had reached South Africa, they had proceeded just according to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s desire, and he had replied to them, “Your report is very encouraging to me, that you distributed 110 Gītās in two days in Capetown.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda often thought of having his books printed in Russian, and he wrote to the minister of education and culture in the U.S.S.R., suggesting they publish “a translation of the ancient classical Vedic literature, namely,Bhagavad-gītā” as already published by “the famous London publishing house of M.S.S. Macmillan Company.” He also talked with his disciples about printing Russian translations in America.\nWhenever Śrīla Prabhupāda met an interested person proficient inanyforeign language, he would request that person to translate his books. In 1972 he had written,\nSimilarly, Śrīla Prabhupāda had written to an American devotee in Indonesia,\nLater, when Prabhupāda heard that the Chinese boy, Yaśomatī-suta, had finished translating three chapters ofBhagavad-gītāinto Chinese, he wrote that they should immediately print those three chapters as a small book.\nISKCON Australia rose to prominence in the book distribution competition and, by 1974, was competing with Los Angeles ISKCON and the Rādhā-Dāmodara party for world leadership. By the fall of 1974 about a dozen top Australian and New Zealand distributors were selling daily more than twenty big books each. The centers in Australia, like those in America, more than doubled their book distribution between 1973 and 1974.\nWhen book distribution had been just beginning in America in 1970, no books had been available in England. But within a year,Kṛṣṇabook distribution had begun there, and Śrīla Prabhupāda had written, “All of my disciples in London center are very intelligent, and they should unite around this single task of selling Krishna book widely throughout Britain.” By 1974 the devotees in Britain were valiantly distributing books. During one busy six-day period, they distributed six hundred volumes ofTeachings of Lord Caitanya,four hundred ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and one thousandBack to Godheadmagazines.\nIndia was special. There Śrīla Prabhupāda had introduced book distribution through the ISKCON life membership program. Wealthy Indians were more inclined to accept the books as part of an ISKCON membership package, which included such benefits as free accommodations in ISKCON temples throughout the world. But in India, as elsewhere, Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted his books distributed to colleges, to libraries, to prominent citizens, and to the masses.\nBy the end of 1974 Prabhupāda’s disciples were ready to print Hindi and Bengali editions ofBack to Godhead.When Śrīla Prabhupāda heard that Western devotees in India were complaining of insufficient engagement, he replied, “I am pleased you are selling many Krishna Books daily. All our men should go out with books. There is sufficient engagement.” To his G.B.C. secretary in India he wrote, “Engage all of them in book distribution specifically, and take with you some sankirtan party.”\n“Without books we will make no progress in India,” Śrīla Prabhupāda had written to Tejās, his temple president in Delhi. Prabhupāda had also trained his leaders in India in the strict policy of “fifty-fifty.” “Proceeds from life membership or any other collections should go fifty percent to the BBT and fifty percent for construction and other projects.” On his order the American BBT had been making donations of books to India and by 1974 had donated three hundred thousand dollars’ worth of literature. Although America was the leading pioneer in book printing and distribution, Prabhupāda foresaw worldwide printing and distribution of his books – eventually to surpass that in the U.S.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had created transcendental competition among his disciples. In 1971 he had observed with pleasure Keśava in San Francisco leading the society inKṛṣṇabook distribution. Prabhupāda had promised that he would leave Los Angeles and stay in San Francisco if Keśava outdistributed his brother, Karandhara. And over the years he had continued to instigate such competition, fanning the fires of book distribution. He would encourage the leaders to send him reports, and then he would respond with letters, raising the book distribution fever even higher.\nThe whole of ISKCON waited to hear the latest quote from Prabhupāda, inspiring them to go on and on. When Śrīla Prabhupāda had given the lecture in January 1974 stressing, “Distribute books, distribute books, distribute books,” several devotees in the audience had vowed on the spot to dedicate their lives to that instruction. And when Prabhupāda had sent the handwritten note down from his room in Los Angeles – “Everyone should go with the Sankirtan Party as soon as possible” – that one line had created a spirit of sacrifice and dedication in the hearts of many disciples, who felt themselves destined to take up that order as their life and soul.\nAlthough Rāmeśvara had been caught up by the waves of thesaṅkīrtanaocean from the beginning, Śrīla Prabhupāda cast Rāmeśvara’s service when he wrote,\nWhen devotees in London reported to Śrīla Prabhupāda their increase in book and magazine sales, he responded by inviting them to compete.\nWhen writing to asannyāsīdisciple preaching in Scotland, where the devotees were perhaps not fully aware of the scope of book distribution in the U.S., Śrīla Prabhupāda mentioned the latest book scores from New York and commented, “New York is leading the list.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda also inspired the Society as a whole to compete with its previous years’ efforts: “Somehow the book distribution must be doubled and tripled as far as possible. Do it.” As soon as the BBT library party had been formed, Prabhupāda had told the members to get fifty thousand orders. And he had asked the Rādhā-Dāmodara party to expand to one hundred buses. The competition was particularly high between Los Angeles, the Rādhā-Dāmodara party, and Australia, and Śrīla Prabhupāda encouraged them all, like a maestro calling for afortissimofrom the orchestra.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was not giving careless, boastful instructions. The determination and sacrifice required to achieve these seemingly unattainable goals he knew well, and he wanted his devotees to work as he worked, with total dedication. He wanted them to try their utmost. His was the logic of “hunting for the rhinoceros,” he said. If a man attempting to shoot a rhinoceros failed, no one would criticize him. But if he succeeded, it would be considered wonderful. Prabhupāda wrote to Rūpānuga,\nWhen a travelingsaṅkīrtanaparty from one temple intensively distributed books in another city, the authorities at the local temple would often be disturbed. This problem came before Śrīla Prabhupāda, who was inevitably called in to judge and to cool down the fires of competition. Prabhupāda wrote to Keśava and Bhūtātmā, who had traveled all the way from San Francisco to London to distribute books but had disturbed the devotees there by their fervor.\nSeeing the mighty efforts of the top book distributors, some devotees became envious, or at least dispirited, thinking themselves useless and unable to please Śrīla Prabhupāda. This problem also came before Śrīla Prabhupāda, who replied, “There must always be competition. That gives life. That cannot be separated from life. … The perfect society does not eliminate competition, but it eliminates envy, because everyone is weak before Kṛṣṇa.”\nBut competition had its limit, as Prabhupāda explained to a doubtingbrahmacārīin Florida.\nCompetition might have been a catalyst, but by steadfastly distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books, the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement were experiencing the essence of loving service to Kṛṣṇa in separation, which is the highest spiritual ecstasy. “Don’t try to see God,” Śrīla Prabhupāda’s spiritual master had often said, “but act in such a way that God sees you.” In other words, by submissively acting on the order of the servant of the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa, Prabhupāda’s disciples were sure to attract Kṛṣṇa’s loving attention.\nThe quickest way to catch Kṛṣṇa’s attention, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, was to direct another person to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The book distributors, therefore, felt a special reciprocation with their spiritual master, and this impelled them to go on serving and distributing.\nSañjaya:Philosophically we saw that going out and distributing books was what our spiritual master wanted us to do. We knew that. That was clear to us.We also had a real sense of idealism – that these books and magazines would change the world. Once you come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you actually see how crummy the world really is, how really contaminated things are, how envious people are, and how horrible material life is. You can see that. You don’t feel that you yourself can change it, but you feel that whoever gets one of Prabhupāda’s books and looks at it will be changed in a spiritual way. There was no question about it. We also felt a big change would come in the world in the future as Kṛṣṇa consciousness spread. Prabhupāda also said that if people just touch one of these books their lives will change. Our faith was in the books and Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nKeśava Bhāratī:When you pass out a book, there is a certain reciprocation from Prabhupāda. There was a dramatic difference in our internal experience when a person would take a book compared to just taking some incense or something. We would actually experience Prabhupāda’s association all day by distributing those books. We didn’t feel left out just because certain devotees were physically closer to Prabhupāda. Book distributors always got strong enlivenment. We would read about Haridāsa Ṭhākura going out and rolling on the ground and begging people to chant. That kind of thing would inspire us.\nVaiśeṣika:We had Prabhupāda’s books and different letters from him. And we also knew that if we distributed lots of books, we could get our name in the newsletter, and we could think of how Prabhupāda would read it. But I was just trying to keep up with the others. Sometimes I would go a couple of hours without giving anyone a book. Everyone else would just be passing them out like crazy. I would try, and people would all but spit in my face. They were pushing me around. It was very heavy for me. I would sometimes just walk off and start crying, it was so heavy. But I knew this book distribution was pleasing to Prabhupāda, and I just wanted to be part of it.\nWe used to think how Prabhupāda was spending so much time behind a dictating machine just writing these books. We would meditate on how he would sleep just a few hours a day and minimize everything else to write these books. So we were also trying to cut down our other activities and just go out and distribute books. Prabhupāda said a devotee should live in the mood of the six Gosvāmīs, so we were singing those prayers every day. We felt a real connection. Even in the beginning a devotee told me, “Where is Prabhupāda, do you know?” And then he said, “He’s in his books.” That mood was always there. We always felt that connection.\nJagaddhātrī-devī dāsī:When I was distributing Prabhupāda’s books, I understood that that was the most pleasing thing I could do for him. I was helping him to fulfill his spiritual master’s instructions, and so he was pleased. And he was even more pleased if I did it nicely. I always used to hear the story about how Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī would be happy if someone went out and distributed even one magazine, because it’s actually themoodofsaṅkīrtana,of going out andtryingto give mercy to the conditioned souls, that counts.\nI always wanted to do welfare work. I like the feeling of doing something for people. So this is thesummum bonumof helping people. You are helping them to go back to Godhead. So that was my motivation. And we automatically become purified by bringing other living entities to Kṛṣṇa.\nTripurāri:I got inspired mostly by Prabhupāda’s greatness – how he was staunchly following his Guru Mahārāja. It was his Guru Mahārāja’s order, and therefore he was doing it. I was never very scholarly or intelligent. I never thought that I had much brains or talent. I was never trained practically in any kind of skill, and I didn’t have much education. I took it like that – that I was talking to the most fallen people and that I was the most fallen myself. I was just doing what Prabhupāda wanted, because he wanted. I would pray to Prabhupāda to help me realize why he wanted book distribution. Then within I would get inspiration, and it would come out in all of my talks about book distribution.\nThat time that I stayed out at the airport when all the devotees went back with Prabhupāda to the temple very much affected my whole spiritual life. I was very much intimately connected with Prabhupāda. But my closest association with him was by following his instructions and just getting down to work and not trying to enjoy the spiritual master but serve him.\nVṛndāvana-vilāsinī-devī dāsī:When Prabhupāda gave that famous lecture in Los Angeles, “Distribute books, distribute books, distribute books,” right then I wanted to take it up. Whenever he wrote to Rāmeśvara, it was really to “Rāmeśvara and Company.” We all felt included. We are all eternal book distributors – a team together. And I wanted to be part of it. It was Lord Caitanya’s eternalsaṅkīrtanaparty, and we all wanted to be part of it. It’s going on in every planet, in every universe. Iknowit is pleasing to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nI would relate to book distribution like the battle of Kurukṣetra. It’s a battle, but Kṛṣṇa is right there. It’s like Kurukṣetra Number Two. I’m sure all book distributors feel like that. You feel like Kṛṣṇa is right there, and He’s going to win. You just have to take shelter of Him. You may not win this battle, but you win the overall war. So I always felt connected with Prabhupāda, because he’s telling us in his books about the great devotees that we can take shelter of. It’s all by his mercy. He’s giving us these books, and he’s in these books.\nSura:We were so much addicted to selling Prabhupāda’s books that we didn’t want to do anything else. We would just go straight to the airport and start distributing and not stop, except for maybe a twenty minute lunch break and maybe some reading for twenty minutes – otherwise nonstop until 7:30 or 8:00 at night. We really felt that Śrīla Prabhupāda was protecting us.\nOne time out at the airport I was given a BBT newsletter. Maybe it was due to the exhaustion or maybe it was due to some false sentimentality or whatever, but I was reading Prabhupāda’s remarks about book distribution, and I became very moved. I was by myself at the airport, and I just started crying, because I thought of how devotees all over the world are so beautiful, so wonderful-hearted, distributing books and working so hard. I was just really appreciating Prabhupāda and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Prabhupāda had said something in the newsletter about book distribution, and it just touched me. We were so absorbed in books, books, books, that whenever Prabhupāda would say anything about book distribution, we would go nuts. That meant it was our connection to Prabhupāda. We weren’t big guns who could sit at a meeting with Prabhupāda or get personal attention so much. Maybe during some morning walks at the Māyāpur festival we got to sneak in with thesannyāsīs,but otherwise our book distribution was our connection with Prabhupāda. When he would mention something about book distribution, it would be our life and soul.\nLavaṅga-latikā-devī dāsī:Having heard Śrīla Prabhupāda speak and knowing that he was always reading from these books, theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and that he was preaching that you have to distribute this knowledge to others made it all very simple. That is, you just knew that this was Śrīla Prabhupāda’s desire. He was always telling us that he was giving us this knowledge and that once you have this knowledge, you have to distribute it to others. Śrīla Prabhupāda came to America to preach with his disciples. So we must do it, because it’s Prabhupāda’s desire. He spent so much time translating these books to be distributed. You just want to distribute to others, and you want people to have these books in their homes.\nVṛndāvana, IndiaApril 20, 1975Śrīla Prabhupāda installed the Deities for the grand opening of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir. Almost a thousand disciples were present, and the governor of Uttar Pradesh was the guest of honor. After years of hard endeavor, the grand opening was a climactic triumph for Śrīla Prabhupāda and his movement. While still standing at the altar after having offered the firstāratito Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, Prabhupāda addressed the crowd, explaining that this was an international temple, where people from all over the world could come to worship and take shelter of Gaura-Nitāi, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma, and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.\nLater that evening, Śrīla Prabhupāda sat in his room with a few G.B.C. men. The buttons on hiskurtāopen because of the heat, his legs and bare feet extended under the low table, he relaxed, and his men sat close around him in the dim light of the desk lamp. It was a milestone, he said, but still they had to go forward, not merely savor their success. Many things were still required to make the temple and guesthouse operative.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was thinking beyond Vṛndāvana. “This temple construction is so important,” he said, “that I’m willing to spend many lakhs to open a temple like this. And yet as important as it is, the book production is even more important.” This was a significant reaffirmation of the priority of book production; even while in the midst of this splendid temple opening, he was stressing that book production was more important.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda seemed displeased, however, because for months hisCaitanya-caritāmṛtahad been delayed by his Sanskrit editor. He said with a scowl that although he had finished theCaitanya-caritāmṛta,it remained unpublished. He had also completed all four volumes of the Fourth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamand was beginning the Fifth, yet only one volume of the Fourth Canto had been published.\nOne of the devotees present, not understanding Prabhupāda’s point, remarked that since Prabhupāda was going next to Hawaii he would be able to write there in peace and quiet. Prabhupāda replied that he was not encouraged to write when his manuscripts were not being published.\nThe BBT Press, after several years in New York, was about to relocate to Los Angeles, where Rāmeśvara would become the new BBT Press supervisor. Rāmeśvara, unaware of the delay in publishing theCaitanya-caritāmṛtamanuscript, learned of it now, in Vṛndāvana. He promised Prabhupāda that he would immediately get the Press set up in Los Angeles and begin producingCaitanya-caritāmṛta.\nThat Śrīla Prabhupāda had completed the entireCaitanya-caritāmṛtamanuscript in eighteen months during 1973 and 1974 was a remarkable feat. In those same months he had been intensely engaged in many affairs of management while constantly traveling. He had confronted major problems with leaders who had left their posts, he had personally attended to G.B.C. duties in India, and he had dealt with other ISKCON managerial affairs. He had authorized many large BBT loans and had approved the expansion and development of ISKCON in all areas of the world, in addition to responding regularly to large volumes of mail, speaking daily to guests, and givingBhāgavatamlectures wherever he went. His only time for writing had been on arising at one in the morning, and he had persistently worked two or three hours each day.\nWhile Śrīla Prabhupāda traveled from Vṛndāvana to Australia, Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha worked in Los Angeles to establish the new BBT offices. Prabhupāda was still meditating on his completedCaitanya-caritāmṛtamanuscript waiting to be published. From Australia he wrote,\nIn Los Angeles Rāmeśvara had only completed the lease arrangements for the new building for the Press. The BBT artists had just arrived, and editors, proofreaders, and other production workers would soon be coming. The Press had purchased a computer typesetter, and the devotees were being trained to use it. Carpenters knocked down walls to build a photo lab and darkroom. Additional plumbing had to be installed, and the entire Press had to be set up within one month. Śrīla Prabhupāda was coming in June, and everything would have to be ready and running.\nBy the time Śrīla Prabhupāda reached Hawaii in May, the Press in Los Angeles was preparing for operation. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s secretary phoned Los Angeles often: “Prabhupāda is angry. He keeps talking about the unpublished books. You’d better be prepared when he arrives.”\nRāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha had investigated the necessities and the difficulties in printing theCaitanya-caritāmṛtamanuscript, which they concluded would come to seventeen volumes. One of the main problems they discovered was the lack of an expert Bengali editor.\nMost of theCaitanya-caritāmṛtawas in Bengali. Although the BBT editors were experienced in Sanskrit, because they were not proficient in Bengali, the work was progressing slowly. Also Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted many paintings in his books, and the art department would need many months to meet his requests.\nNever before had the BBT lagged so far behind Śrīla Prabhupāda. Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha, straining their brains to produce books quickly and efficiently, devised a stepped-up production schedule. By the old schedule they could publish a book every three or four months, but on the new schedule they decided they could produce a book a month. In that way, they would eventually catch up with Śrīla Prabhupāda. Rāmeśvara was eager to present Prabhupāda with this plan when he came to Los Angeles.\nMore phone calls came from Prabhupāda’s secretary. Prabhupāda had heard about the preparation of the Press buildings, but he had also heard that his name had not been displayed on the front of the BBT building. He was always insistent to preserve ISKCON’s disciplic succession, foreseeing that unless ISKCON stressed A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami as the founder-ācārya,in the future persons might claim their rights of ISKCON leadership or of ownership of ISKCON properties. In the rush for completing the buildings, the BBT managers had overlooked this important detail.\nJune 20, 1975On arriving in Los Angeles, Śrīla Prabhupāda received a joyous welcome. He was accompanied by leadingsannyāsīsand G.B.C. secretaries, including Kīrtanānanda Swami, Viṣṇujana Swami, Brahmānanda Swami, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, and others. Later, sitting in his room – one of his favorites in all of ISKCON – he spoke only briefly about the backlog of unprinted books. He seemed mildly disturbed but said little. He was very pleased, however, to see the temple and the Deities of Rukmiṇī-Dvārakādhīśa.\nIn his short arrival speech he had explained why he was so urgently pressing his disciples to produce his books. “I have no personal qualification,” he had said from the plushly upholsteredvyāsāsana,“but I simply try to satisfy myguru,that’s all. My Guru Mahārāja asked me that, ‘If you get some money, you print books.’ So there was a private meeting, talking. Some of my important Godbrothers also were there – it was in Rādhā-kuṇḍa. So Guru Mahārāja was speaking to me that, ‘Since we have got this Baghbazar marble temple, there has been so much dissension. And everyone thinking who will occupy this room or that room. I wish therefore to sell this temple and the marble and print some books.’ Yes, so I took up this from his mouth, that he is very fond of books. And he told me personally, ‘If you get some money, print books.’ Therefore I am stressing on this point – Where is book? Where is book? So kindly help me. That is my request. Print as many books as possible in as many languages as possible, and distribute throughout the whole world. Then the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will automatically increase.”\n“Yes, Prabhupāda,” Rāmeśvara responded, attentive and concerned. The other devotees also nodded, commiserating. Something must be done.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda continued, “they must be published immediately.”\n“Yes, Prabhupāda,” Rāmeśvara replied obediently.\n“So I think they can be printed in two months,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said conclusively.\nRāmeśvara wasn’t sure he had heard correctly. The Press had only just opened. The artists didn’t even have the lights in their room. Two months was illogical, impossible. Now was the moment to tell Śrīla Prabhupāda the plan for increased production. Rāmeśvara stepped closer.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he began, “we’ve been meeting about this, and now that the Press is finally here and established, I think we can increase production four times. We think that now we can go from producing one book every four months to producing one of your books every month.” Now both Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha were walking together beside Śrīla Prabhupāda, with Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami and Brahmānanda Swami walking on his other side.\n“One book every month,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, as if thinking out loud and considering it. “That means over one year. It is not fast enough.” The other devotees looked over at Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha, who glanced at each other.\n“You have to do all the books in two months’ time,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said again. They had clearly heard it this time, and the two managers were stunned in disbelief.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Rāmeśvara said, “I think that’s impossible. Maybe we can go faster…“\nŚrīla Prabhupāda suddenly stopped walking. Planting his cane firmly in the sand, he turned to Rāmeśvara and said, without anger but very gravely, “Impossibleis a word found in the fool’s dictionary.”\nSuddenly Rāmeśvara realized his spiritual life was on the line. To say “impossible” now would mean he had no faith in Kṛṣṇa’s representative, no faith in the power of God. He must throw away his material estimations and rational common sense.\nWhile Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha stood speechless, Śrīla Prabhupāda resumed walking, accompanied by the others. The two devotees hurried to catch up, but now everyone looked at them as if to say, “Come on. Stop doubting. You have to do it.” Rāmeśvara asked Śrīla Prabhupāda if he could discuss this with the other devotees at the Press and then report back. “Oh, yes,” Prabhupāda replied, “whatever is required.” Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha dropped back, while Śrīla Prabhupāda and the others continued down the beach.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda returned to the temple and toured the new Press facilities – a graphic arts building and an editorial building. While walking outside on a second-floor veranda, he noticed below a two-foot strip of bare earth running between the two buildings. He seemed annoyed and said that they should plant grass there.\nIn the layout room a transparency of baby Kṛṣṇa carrying Nanda Mahārāja’s shoes was on the light table, and Śrīla Prabhupāda began laughing when he saw it. He approved of the new typesetting equipment, which worked faster than the previous equipment, and when the devotees demonstrated it for him, he remarked that in India he had dreamed of having such a Press.\nIn Rādhāvallabha’s office Prabhupāda sat in the production manager’s chair and looked up at the large bulletin board that displayed all the steps in the production of a book. He laughed and said, “For someone like me, this makes it even more complicated.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda walked into every room in the two buildings and saw all the equipment. This modern technology was fine, he concluded, as long as they could use it to meet the deadline of seventeen books in two months; otherwise, their equipment was like the technology of the material scientists who tried to go to the moon – useless.\nAll through the morning program in the temple, Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha tried to concentrate on chanting theirjapaand on Prabhupāda’s class, but all they could think of was arranging for the production of seventeen volumes in two months. And by the time they met with the Press workers, they had become convinced it could be done. It was as if some mystical power was going to descend. Somehow or other it could be done. So they presented the plan and convinced the other workers.\n“It can be done,” Rāmeśvara said later, talking with Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Hmmm,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied.\nBut there were some conditions, Rāmeśvara said. For the Bengali editing to go smoothly, the editors would have to be able to regularly consult Śrīla Prabhupāda. Immediately Prabhupāda agreed, adding that he was prepared to stay in Los Angeles as long as necessary to insure that they met the two-month deadline. Another condition Rāmeśvara raised was that the artists would be working as quickly as humanly possible, but the paintings might not be of the best quality. “A blind uncle is better than no uncle,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. When Rāmeśvara mentioned that the artists would have many technical questions, Prabhupāda agreed to make time to answer them. He also agreed that photographs of Indian holy places connected withcaitanya-līlācould be used to supplement the paintings.\nAfter their meeting with Śrīla Prabhupāda, Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha felt that they had a chance. They left Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, running down the stairs. The marathon was on."

        "content": "ALTHOUGH ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA had said he would stay in Los Angeles, he soon decided to follow his original travel plans. Feeling compelled to see to the welfare of his disciples around the country, he left on a tour of thirteen ISKCON centers in the U.S. and Canada. About half a dozen of hissannyāsīdisciples traveled with him.\nDenverJune 27, 1975Śrīla Prabhupāda was pleasantly surprised to see the brick church building that was now a Kṛṣṇa temple. The temple hall was spacious, and afternoon sunshine streamed into the room. He beheld the small golden forms of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa on the altar and then walked to the rear of the hall, where he sat on thevyāsāsana,allowing the devotees to bathe his feet. These devotees, unaccustomed to being with their spiritual master, were awkward in performing the standard formalities. But they were enthusiastic and happy.\nSitting on the floor before Śrīla Prabhupāda, Daśaratha began singingOhe Vaiṣṇava Ṭhākura,accompanying himself on the harmonium. Śrīla Prabhupāda liked his singing and, when the song was finished, asked, “You know the meaning?”\nDaśaratha replied, “ ‘O venerable Vaiṣṇava, O ocean of mercy, please be merciful unto your servant.’ ”\nAnother devotee added, “ ‘I pray for the shade of your lotus feet.’ ”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda acknowledged, and he began to speak about the song’s author, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. He then quoted another song by Narottama dāsa,chādiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā.This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is fornistāra,he said. “Nistārameans to be liberated from the capture ofmāyā.When we hear songs by the Vaiṣṇavas, that is called liberation.”\nAlthough the devotees had heard before of Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura and of liberation, they listened especially attentively now. Here was the Vaiṣṇava Ṭhākura in person, come to teach them to control their passions, to impart to them the strength to carry out thesaṅkīrtanamovement, and to bless them, as Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura described, “with one drop of faith with which to attain the great treasure of the holy name.”\n“So I am very glad to see this temple,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said to the group of about forty devotees. “You have purchased it? That’s nice. Very good space. And the devotees here are very nice. So, our process is very simple – that we dedicate our life to the service of the Vaiṣṇava, and according to his direction, we engage inśravaṇaṁ kīrtanam,hearing and chanting of Viṣṇu. And refrain from the sinful activities. Then life is successful. We do not require to be very learned or very rich man or to take birth in very high family.”\n“So bullet is expected also?” Prabhupāda laughed.\nBrahmānanda remarked that the world leaders were always in anxiety. Prabhupāda agreed – in the material world there was danger at every step.\nHe began talking of Indian politics: Indira Gandhi and Jayaprakash Narayan in bitter disagreement. “Both of them are in distressed position,” Prabhupāda said. “I am thinking of writing them on the basis of ourBhagavad-gītā.Do you think it is advised?” When Śrīla Prabhupāda mentioned that Indira Gandhi occasionally went to see herguru,Ānandamayī, Brahmānanda remarked that herguruhad commented favorably about the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa.\n“So, what do you think?” Prabhupāda asked hissannyāsīs,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, Bhavānanda, and Satsvarūpa. “Shall I write? Hmmm? I have made a draft of a letter this night. So you come and see. Let us take a chance. We want good for everyone, and this is the only medicine, Hare Kṛṣṇa, for all wrongs.Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.People are suffering.”\nThe devotees agreed the letters would be a good idea, although they doubted whether the politicians would take the advice or even read such letters.\nPrabhupāda then asked about the public’s response to Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Denver.\n“They get nice attendance on Sundays,” Satsvarūpa answered. “Many people come.”\n“There is good hope,” Prabhupāda affirmed.\n“Good book distribution here, too.”\nPrabhupāda nodded.“Thatis the most successful. Wherever book distribution is going on nicely, that is successful. Because people are in gross ignorance, they are taking this temporary life as everything. Very horrible condition. We are trying to explain what is the actual life.”\nThey arrived at the park, which was filled with tall old pines, maples, and oaks. Getting out of the car, Prabhupāda stood facing a pond. In the distance he could see the Denver skyline and the Rocky Mountains. He could hear the quacking of ducks and geese from the pond.\nA second carload of devotees arrived, and Prabhupāda and his followers began walking along a paved path beside the lake. “Very nice park,” Prabhupāda remarked, “and not far away.”\nThey soon came upon a large modern building, the Museum of Natural History. “That means Darwin’s theory, that’s all,” said Prabhupāda. “Their whole civilization is based on this Darwin’s theory. How long you shall keep history? Do you know what is the history of the sun, when it was created, when it came into appearance? Can Darwin give us the history of the sun, or the moon, or the sky? Where is the history? Thereishistory, but where is your history? You simply imagine, ‘There was a chunk, and it became manifested as the sun, moon. And I am also this.’ What do you actually know? How has this cosmic manifestation come into existence?”\nThe sun rose with dazzling, golden rays and quickly warmed the air. The devotees offered Prabhupāda information about Denver, “the mile-high city.” It was good for health, they said. Prabhupāda said the climate was as in Punjab, the upcountry in India. He also heard how Colorado was known as “cow country” because its main industry was slaughter.\nPrabhupāda walked past a zoo and down a hill. He passed a Civil War cannon and saw many colorful flower beds, expansive lawns, and everywhere the tall pines. Although the air seemed chilly for July, the brightness of the rising sun was unusual, and the natural scenery of the park stood out sharply. Śrīla Prabhupāda also appeared bathed in golden light as he walked briskly, wrapped in his graycādara,talking from time to time with his disciples.\nPrabhupāda mentioned Gopal Agarwal, the man at whose home he had first stayed after arriving in America in 1965. Gopal’s father, he said, was a very rich man in Mathurā, and Gopal had come to America to be an electrical engineer. He was not doing as well as he would have by staying in India, Prabhupāda said. Gopal’s wife, Sally, used to say, “My husband is a lost child of his parents.”\n“People are working so hard day and night for these temporary years,” Prabhupāda said, “although by laboring less than that, they can go back to Godhead. Just to get a nice car, a nice wife and a few children by working so hard. And by the same labor, if he devotes himself to Kṛṣṇa consciousness then he goes back home, back to Godhead. And what is wrong there? We have got so many Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees. What is wrong there, compared to these ordinarykarmīs? Hmm? Are you unhappy? What do you think? All their efforts will be finished, and after death they will become a cat or a dog or a tree.”\nDevotee: “Sometimes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, even if we explain this and the people seem to understand, still they won’t do anything about it.”\nPrabhupāda: “So you have to constantly poke them. Just like when a man is sleeping, you have to call him constantly, ‘Mr. John! Mr. John! Wake up, you rascal! Why are you sleeping? You have got this opportunity of human form of life. Now get up! Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and solve all your problems.’ ”\nDevotee: “Some people say that if we want to do this it’s all right, but we shouldn’t preach and insist to them. Everyone has his own way.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “But you are a human being. You rascal, you are sleeping! And we are just trying to awaken you. Suppose a child was going off to one side where there is danger. We are human beings, so we shall say, ‘No, no, go to the right.’ We shall try to save him. That is our business, to do good to others. That is the mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Not that, ‘This man is going to hell, so let him go to hell. But at least I am happy.’Thatisnot humane.”\nDevotee: “A lot of times, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they feel we’re just escaping material life. They say we don’t have jobs and that we should work for a living.”\nPrabhupāda (addressing an imaginary challenger): “You rascal! You have no money – you work. But we are rich men. We are Kṛṣṇa’s sons. So why shall I work like you, an ass? An ass will work unnecessarily. We are not asses.”\nBhagavad-gītā,Prabhupāda said, establishes Lord Kṛṣṇa as the proprietor of everything. The servants of Kṛṣṇa, therefore, should not be expected to work hard like asses. Asses work hard, not human beings. This was also the instruction of Ṛṣabhadeva in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Ṛṣabhadeva told His sons that human life is not meant for working hard simply for food and sex enjoyment. That was the business of hogs.\nPrabhupāda: “Tell them they are working like hogs, and we are living like human beings. That is the difference. If somebody does not work hard like a hog, does that mean he is escaping?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued to vigorously develop his theme. He argued very seriously and yet in a delightful way, showing the fortune of one who becomes a servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotees could not refrain from smiling and laughing as they hurried to keep up with his pace and with his Kṛṣṇa conscious logic.\nPrabhupāda: “I was a student of economics. There we learned Marshall’s theory. He says that human nature is such that unless a person has obligation, he will not work. That is the beginning of economics. If one already has something sufficient to eat, then he will not work. So if we have sufficient to eat, why shall we work? What is the answer? This is not escaping, it is coming to the light. To not work and yet get our necessities is comfort. But to work hard just to get the bare necessities of life, that is for the hogs and dogs.”\nDevotee: “They have no faith or trust that this can be done.”\nPrabhupāda: “See us, you rascal! See! Open your eyes! See that we have no business. We have no food stock. Still we are not worried. We do not know what we shall eat in the evening, but still we are not worried. I came to your country without any subsistence.” Prabhupāda argued that man’s economic necessities could be easily settled by keeping cows and land. He said that men have made an unnecessary, complex arrangement just for maintaining the body, thereby forgetting the purpose of human life. When a devotee contended that not everyone had the opportunity to get land, Prabhupāda said that this was simply mismanagement. There was plenty of land in America.\nDevotee: “Śrīla Prabhupāda, they accuse us of being parasites.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “No. A parasite means if he takes others’ property and tries to enjoy it. But we are not enjoying others’ property. We are enjoying our father’s property.Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam.Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor. Why do you say parasite? We are good children of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa says, ‘Don’t work. I shall give you everything.’ Actually Kṛṣṇa says that: ‘Why are you working so hard? Just surrender to Me and I will give you protection – whatever you want.’ So we are giving everything. Why say parasite?”\nThe devotees were well aware that Śrīla Prabhupādadidwork, traveling constantly, managing his worldwide Kṛṣṇa conscious society, rising in the middle of the night to translateŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.And his disciples also worked hard. But they did not work like animals and animal-like persons for things that would be destroyed in time, and they did not work at horrible enterprises that ruined the best part of human nature. They did not work like asses and claim they had no time left in the day to chant the holy name of God.\nPrabhupāda: “Now this is a nice park, but nobody is coming here. We Kṛṣṇa conscious people, we are taking advantage. Sotheyare escaping orweare escaping? Just see how foolish they are. They work so hard, but they are not taking advantage. But we are taking. So our policy is thatyouwork hard, and we go and take from you. This is not escaping, this is intelligence.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s example was a delightful revelation to the devotees, and they laughed at the obvious truth. Here they were, walking so pleasantly with their spiritual master, and yet no one else was coming to enjoy the park.\nPrabhupāda: “But as soon as we ask, ‘You also come and join,’ they will not. They say, ‘No, we shall work like this.’ We are asking everyone, ‘Come here,’ but they will not come. That is their enviousness. Therefore they say we are escaping and living at the cost of others. They see that we have got so many cars and the devotees’ faces are bright. We are eating nicely and have no problems. But if we ask them to come, then it is very difficult. If we ask them to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance, oh, it is a very big, heavy task for them. As soon as they will come, they will know that there is no tea, no liquor, no meat, no cigarette. So you can say that we are escaping these things. But we are not escaping happiness. They are escaping happiness.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “Everything must come from something. No one can deny that. Now we give our challenge: Do you know what that Absolute Truth is?”\nBrahmānanda: “We know there is an Absolute Truth, but at this time we cannot directly say what it is.”\nPrabhupāda immediately replied that if a person admits not knowing the Absolute Truth, then that person has no grounds for rejecting the Vedic explanation of the Absolute. That person cannot deny Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth. “If you don’t know the philosophy,” Prabhupāda said, “then you must agree to hear from an authority who does.”\nSatsvarūpa: “Yes, that argument is logical, and we should at least listen to you. But we have heard so many versions of the truth. Why should we accept your version?”\nPrabhupāda: “That is like saying, ‘I have come across so many counterfeit coins. Why should I think there are real coins?’ There are counterfeit coins, and there must also be genuine coins. It is our misfortune if we are unable to distinguish the real coins from the counterfeit coins.”\nAnothersannyāsīchallenged that the Kṛṣṇa conscious version was dogmatic, since there were many truths and many gods. But the Absolute Truth is one, Śrīla Prabhupāda replied, because God is one. God has no competitors. If a person does not accept Kṛṣṇa as God, then he has to present someone who is more fully God than Kṛṣṇa. But if someone does not know who is God, then that person cannot deny Kṛṣṇa.\n“If you speak that way,” Prabhupāda continued, “thenyouare being dogmatic. You do not know what God is, yet dogmatically you are saying that Kṛṣṇa is not God.”\nPrabhupāda compared those who deny the supremacy of Kṛṣṇa to owls who do not open their eyes to see the sunlight. Such persons demand to see God, but when God comes before them personally or when He sends His pure representative, they will not see.\nWhen one of the devotees told Prabhupāda he got drowsy after eating heavily of grains and therefore preferred fruit, Prabhupāda said that was all right; fruit was offered to the Deity. When Yadubara said that in Los Angeles the families often cooked in their own homes instead of taking theprasādamof the Deity, Bhavānanda Goswami testified how wonderful it was at the Māyāpur festival when hundreds of devotees sat down and tookprasādamtogether.\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, what is the difficulty?Capātīs,rice, they are innocent foods. What is the difficulty?”\nHarikeśa: “A lot of devotees are quoting you. They say there is no need to eat grains and that you said that grains were for the animals.”\nPrabhupāda: “But I am eating grains.”\nHarikeśa: “I tell them that.”\nPrabhupāda: “They say, ‘Prabhupāda says.’ Then you believe that.”\nPrabhupāda said that devotees should not listen to health advice if it resulted in their refusing to honor the Lord’sprasādam.\nPrabhupāda: “Therefore, follow takingprasādam.Let whatever may happen.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa: “Let usdieeatingprasādam.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. [Laughter.] That is devotee. But we must prepare very first-class foodstuffs. And then, where is the complaint, if it is first class?”\nReturning from the walk, Śrīla Prabhupāda continued to discuss the topic inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamclass: “I was hearing that we are not takingprasādam –especially thegṛhasthas.No. That is not good. You should takeprasādam.” Prabhupāda described howbhakti-yogabegins with controlling the tongue – by chanting and by eatingkṛṣṇa-prasādam.\n“So in our branches,” he continued, “all the devotees takeprasādamtogether. That is nice. Why we should not be liking to takeprasādamin the temple? What is the fault? No, this is not good. Everyone should takeprasādam.… It is calledprasāda-sevā[service], notprasādamenjoyment.Prasādammeans giving service.Prasādamis as good as Kṛṣṇa and should be respected as good as Kṛṣṇa. So one must have faith that it is not material. Those who are attached to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and are attached to the service, they should takeprasādam– first-classprasādam.Everyone likes the taste ofprasādam.”\nJuly 2, 1975On the plane from Denver to Chicago, Prabhupāda scanned aTimemagazine essay on crime, a cover story entitled, “Crime: Why and What To Do?” Landing at O’Hare Airport, he was greeted by hundreds of cheering devotees and the press.\n“Your Divine Grace,” Śrī Govinda, the Chicago temple president, said, pushing forward, “this is Ms. Jones from NBC television.”\n“How do you do?” smiled Ms. Jones, and several other reporters held microphones before Prabhupāda. “I would like to know what the occasion is. Why are you visiting Chicago?”\n“Just now I have seen one article inTimemagazine,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied. He raised his right hand in an instructing gesture and leaned against the cane he held in his left hand. “It was four or five pages,” he continued – “ ‘Crime: Why and How to Solve It?’ If you are serious, then you can take our method and suggestions. Then you can stop this crime.”\n“You have a way to stop the crime?”\n“Oh, yes, I have.”\n“Can you explain a little bit more how you do it?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda nodded. “That we have to suggest. The social, political, educational, cultural – everything has to be changed. So if you come, we can give you in details how it can be done.”\nMs. Jones dropped the issue and asked Prabhupāda how he felt about his welcome. She seemed unnerved by the devotees crowding around to see and hear Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“By God’s grace,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “wherever I go they welcome me like that.”\nMs. Jones: “Are you used to anything a bit more serene?”\n“Serene?” Prabhupāda thoughtfully considered the word as they all stood together in the midst of the noisy, heavily trafficked airport. “Of course, our whole propaganda is serene,” he said. “Yes. We are distributing God consciousness. It is the most serene movement. People have to learn it very nicely.”\n“Thank you,” said Ms. Jones. She had gotten enough.\nBut Prabhupāda added a last word. “My message is to stop the crimes of your country. This is my sum and substance. You have read the article inTimemagazine, ‘Crime and How to Stop It’? So if you take my advice, that can be stopped.”\n“The world is simply full of criminals,” Prabhupāda continued, seated in the back seat of the car as they pulled away from the airport’s entrance. “Crime meanspāpī,sinful.” To Śrīla Prabhupāda it seemed to make no difference that he was sitting in a car with a few disciples and not speaking with the press. “If simply by law you want to suppress them, it will not be successful. Deliver them. Then you also come along with them. Not that these criminals only should be delivered, and you will go on continuing with criminal activities, slaughterhouse and killing the child in the womb. You are criminal yourself. The whole state.”\n“So we can solve this,” Prabhupāda said to the few disciples with him. “Why not invite them to hear us, how we can solve? We can arrange big, big meetings on this point. ‘Crime: Why and What To Do?’ A very suitable headline it is.”\nPrabhupāda continued to develop a Kṛṣṇa conscious analysis of crime. As long as society violates the laws of nature, he said, there must be crime. He thought it significant that, according to theTimearticle, the leaders of the country were actually wondering what to do about the increasing crime rate and that they were admitting they didn’t know the solution. “Now,” he said, “our business is to give the solution to these leaders, if they actually want the welfare of the country.”\nAll the problems could be solved by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Śrīla Prabhupāda had often said, and now he was eager to tackle the particular problem of crime. America’s leaders were admitting their bewilderment, and if they were actually sincere, then they might accept the Kṛṣṇa conscious solution. Prabhupāda was keen to preach to the government leaders; Kṛṣṇa consciousness was meant especially for them.Bhagavad-gītāstated that therājarṣis,or saintly kings, should disseminate the teachings of theGītāto the citizens. But were the leaders actually serious? Śrīla Prabhupāda wondered.Hewas serious, and he anticipated the special opportunity that might arise here in Chicago to preach to the leaders about ending crime.\nWhile sitting with a group of disciples in his room, Śrīla Prabhupāda asked for a particularBhāgavatamverse to be read, and he gave the opening Sanskrit,kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ.\nHarikeśa read, “A completely bewildered material civilization is wrongly directed toward the fulfillment of desires in sense gratification. In such civilization, in all spheres of life, the ultimate end is sense gratification. In politics, social service, altruism, philanthropy and, ultimately in religion or even in salvation, the very same tint of sense gratification is ever-increasingly predominant. In the political field leaders of men fight with one another to fulfill their personal sense gratification.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda interrupted, “Now in India this is happening. All these things are foreseen. I have already discussed all this in the purport. Then?”\nHarikeśa continued reading: “The voters adore the so-called leaders only when they promise sense gratification. As soon as the voters are dissatisfied in their own sense satisfaction, they dethrone the leaders. The leaders must always dissatisfy the voters by not satisfying their senses.”\nAgain Prabhupāda interrupted. “There are protest meetings and processions, but nobody will be able to satisfy them, because they do not know how to keep the mass of people satisfied. These rascals, they do not know. I have always said they are rascals. Now they ask, ‘What to do?’ They will face so many problems. ‘What to do?’ – this is the beginning. The whole world will be in chaos if they do not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So many ‘What to do?’ will come. Just tell them that here is the remedy. Now it is the time for preaching. They are thinking. They are sleeping, but now they are thinking what to do. They are blindly following sense gratification, and now it has come to the stage of what to do.\n“This is the opportunity for preaching. We are the only persons who can give solution. There is no other group or any man in the world. We are only. So let them take advantage of our knowledge and apply. Now all thesannyāsīshave got the good opportunity to preach.”\nImmediately Prabhupāda referred to theTimenews article on crime. “The remedy,” he said, “is to train first-class men.” He told the mayor briefly of the Vedic society’s four natural divisions, pointing out that society had become so degraded that everyone is in the fourth class, the lowest class – and sinking. The only hope was to train some first-class and second-class men.\n“We certainly need a new approach,” admitted Mayor Vaneman, “because we’re not being successful now.”\nAfter less than half an hour’s conversation, Śrīla Prabhupāda was ready to make a bold request. Previously Jagadīśa, the G.B.C. secretary for Chicago, had mentioned that a very large municipally-owned building across the street was vacant. Śrīla Prabhupāda decided to ask the mayor to donate it. Already he had explained to the mayor that Kṛṣṇa consciousness could stop crime and drug addiction, and he now asked Harikeśa to read a letter by Dr. Stillson Judah, author ofHare Krishna and the Counterculture.In the letter Dr. Judah appreciated Kṛṣṇa consciousness for “transforming lives from drug-addicted hippies to loving servants of Kṛṣṇa and humanity.”\n“So we can stop this, provided we are given the facility to work on,” said Prabhupāda. When the mayor replied yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda made his request.\n“So I was thinking,” Prabhupāda said, “just in front of here there is a very nice house, Merrywood, a big house. You have knowledge about this house?”\nThe mayor replied that this building was to be the new city hall of Evanston. Śrīla Prabhupāda had not been told about this, and he hesitated, while the mayor spoke of how the city’s offices, scattered for so long in nine different locations, could now all be together in this one building.\n“But this is more important,” Prabhupāda said. “City service is going on, but criminals are increasing. So why not give us a little opportunity?”\nMayor Vaneman explained politely that he would have to talk with the city manager, tactfully excusing himself from commitment.\n“If we get a good place,” Prabhupāda continued, “with the cooperation of the authorities, then our simple program is, as Professor Judah has remarked, to turn drug-addicted hippies into devotees. We shall invite everyone to come and chant Hare Kṛṣṇamantraand takeprasādam.I began this movement in New York, alone. And these boys gradually came to me. But my process was this: chanting and giving themprasādam.Everyone will be glad to accept it. They will read these books. These devotees here are practical examples. I am a poor Indian. I did not bribe them, neither have I any money.” Prabhupāda laughed. “So now they have dedicated their lives for this purpose. So I want to do it on a large scale.”\nBut there were practical alternatives. Perhaps, Prabhupāda suggested, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement could use part of the building for a year. He continued describing the efficacy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But the mayor had little else to say. Prabhupāda hadprasādambrought in and asked his guest if he had any further inquiry.\n“No, I really don’t think I do,” Mayor Vaneman replied, “but I think I’d like to learn more about your movement. And I have enjoyed talking and listening to you, and I appreciate it.”\nAfter the mayor left, one of Prabhupāda’s disciples questioned why they would want such a big building. The Chicago temple was large and not at all crowded.\n“My idea is,” Prabhupāda said, “I want to draw the attention of the authorities. If they cooperate, then we can push on our movement more vigorously.”\n“But with our present location here, we cannot?” a devotee asked.\n“We are doing it on a small scale,” Prabhupāda explained. “It is going on. But if we get support from the authorities, we can push on in a larger scale.”\n“Unless you clean the heart,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “you cannot stop criminality simply by laws. The laws are already known by the thief and murderer, but still they commit, because the heart is unclean. And our process is to cleanse the heart.”\n“A very difficult task, sir,” said Lieutenant Mozee.\nPrabhupāda replied that itwasn’tdifficult; he was already doing it on a small scale. “They are faced with the problem ‘Why crime and what to do?’ ” he said, “and we are giving the answer. So you take advantage of it. Why crime? We are saying because they are godless. And what to do? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and takeprasādam.Now if you like you can take. Otherwise we are doing our own business. Just like a poor medical man – he is also giving medicine. But if he is given facility, he can open a big hospital. That is our proposition. We are already doing that business, but if we get facility from the authorities then we can open a big place, a big hospital. And the problem is already big. Otherwise, why are they saying, ‘What to do?’ ”\nIllinois state assemblyman John Porter, who came with his wife, also asked about the solution to crime, but he had a more direct, personal interest in spiritual life. Was it possible, he asked, to make spiritual advancement without living in the temple? Śrīla Prabhupāda told him yes, if he chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa, which he could do anywhere. And he should read the standard books of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nMr. Porter also inquired about the Kṛṣṇa conscious understanding of certain Christian theological points, such as original sin and salvation. Śrīla Prabhupāda, however, did not indulge in discussing theoretical or comparative religion but emphasized the necessity of strictly following the instructions given by God or His representative. “The main business,” Prabhupāda said, “is to understand God.”\nMr. Porter seemed unlikely to help the devotees get a large building, but he had inquired humbly about spiritual life. Prabhupāda’s unstinting deliverance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was not conditional. If anyone sincerely inquired, be he assemblyman or criminal, Śrīla Prabhupāda was always eager to give him the mercy of Lord Caitanya.\nEach morning he lectured in the large hall at the Evanston temple before several hundred devotees, speaking about the life of Ajāmila. Each day he would tell more of the history of the sinner Ajāmila, who was saved at the time of death by calling out the name of God, Nārāyaṇa. On the fourth morning Prabhupāda was explaining how Ajāmila had named one of his sons Nārāyaṇa.\n“So the idea is that by God’s grace, in the beginning of his life Ajāmila engaged himself to be Kṛṣṇa conscious and was initiated. Then years later Kṛṣṇa gave him the advice, ‘All right, you keep this youngest son’s name Nārāyaṇa. Because you’ll be naturally attached to this body, and you will call him, “Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, please come here. Nārāyaṇa, take your food. Nārāyaṇa, take your drink.” So you will chant Nārāyaṇa.’ ”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda suddenly became stunned, unable to speak. Such a thing had happened before, but rarely. He remained in trance, while a pregnant silence held the room. The devotees could see that Prabhupāda was experiencing a powerful spiritual emotion. Many of them felt that when he had called out “Nārāyaṇa,” he had come face to face with Nārāyaṇa; he was seeing Kṛṣṇa, who was showing how very pleased He was with His pure devotee.\nSurely Kṛṣṇawasvery pleased with Prabhupāda, and although Prabhupāda was fully engaged with the details of his movement within the material world, Kṛṣṇawaswith him, giving him assurance from the spiritual world. For the devotees this moment confirmed the existence of the spiritual world and confirmed that Prabhupāda belonged to that world and was only visiting the material world to give Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Most of the devotees were neophytes, still attached to the material and having little vision of the spiritual. But now they could see the spiritual world through Śrīla Prabhupāda’s ecstatic trance.\nAfter about a minute, Śrīla Prabhupāda returned to external consciousness. “All right,” he said. And then, with the same words he used to end all his lectures, he said, “Thank you very much.” Then devotees began a rousing, melodickīrtana.It had been a special moment, and they kept it in their hearts.\nA reporter challenged that the four divisions of society were contrary to everything in American tradition, but Śrīla Prabhupāda replied that only training was required. America was training doctors, engineers, lawyers, and America could train some first-class men.\nWoman reporter: “Where do women fit into this social structure? You keep referring to a man.”\nPrabhupāda replied that a woman was a man’s (her husband’s) assistant. If a woman was faithful to a first-class man (abrāhmaṇa), then she also became first class. If she was married to a second-class man (akṣatriya), then she would be considered second class. If she was married to a third-class man (avaiśya), then she was third class. According to the status of her husband, she became first, second, third, or fourth.\nWoman reporter: “You mean she’s not qualified as first, second, or third class until she’s married?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “Yes, a woman requires protection. In childhood she should be protected by the father, in youth by the husband, and in old age by the elderly sons.”\nThe same reporter asked if Prabhupāda thought Indira Gandhi was having political trouble because she was a woman and therefore incapable.\n“Why are you trying to put me in the emergency law?” Prabhupāda laughed. He then quoted Cāṇakya Paṇḍita: “Never trust a woman or a politician.”\nPrabhupāda had created a sensation, and within a few hours Chicago’s radio and TV stations were talking of the news conference, concentrating almost entirely on his comments about women. A woman alderman, scheduled to visit Prabhupāda, phoned to say that she was cancelling because of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s expressed attitudes toward women. A TV station phoned and requested to come over that evening to do an interview.\nWhile the Chicago news reporters wrote their stories for the evening and morning editions, Prabhupāda’s comments were further picked up by United Press International and Associated Press wire services. Śrīla Prabhupāda had wanted to reach the public with his Kṛṣṇa conscious message, and therefore he had arrived in Chicago with the specific idea of broadcasting his solution to crime, but now he had hit on a topic that was attracting far more attention. He had had the boldness to assert, in the midst of America’s predominant mood of women’s liberation, woman’s real place in society.\nThe devotees were excited by the controversy and were eager to understand the Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy more deeply and to present it exactly.\nThey complained that none of the reporters had delved deeply or allowed Prabhupāda to express his ideas of spiritual equality, yet when Prabhupāda heard that evening that he had touched off so much media response, he was amused. He was ready to tell them more.\n“Why only the woman should become pregnant?” he said, reiterating his point before the small group of devotees in his room. “The man goes away, and she has to take care of the children and beg from the government. Is that independence?”\nDevotee: “Then the independence has become contraception. They say, ‘I do not want to have the child.’ ”\nPrabhupāda: “That means you commit another sinful activity. You will be punished.”\nDevotee: “Śrīla Prabhupāda, the whole civilization, American Western civilization, is now bewildered by this theory of women’s liberation.”\nPrabhupāda: “But how they will be liberated? On this point first of all let me know. Anyway, I am not speaking of my experience. When we speak, we speak from theśāstra.Women’s dependence is described inManu-saṁhitā.Just like Queen Kuntī – she is not an ordinary woman. She was learned and exalted.”\nBrahmānanda Swami: “This is one point. In our devotional line there are spiritual leaders who have been women, such as Kuntī.”\nPrabhupāda: “Therefore I say that Kuntī remained dependent on her sons. That is my proposition. Her sons were banished. But when they went to the forest she followed, because she thought, ‘I am a widow. I am dependent on my sons. So wherever they remain, I shall remain.’ Similarly Sītā, the wife of Lord Rāmacandra. Lord Rāmacandra was requested by His father to go to the forest, not Sītā. But she preferred to go with her husband. When her husband said, ‘You are not banished. You stay at home,’ she said, ‘No. I am dependent on You. Wherever You shall go, I must go.’ This is Vedic culture.”\nDevotee: “Her chastity was her great virtue. But nowadays that is no longer true.”\nPrabhupāda: “Nowadays may be different, but I am speaking the Vedic idea. That’s all. In all circumstances, unless her husband is crazy or something like that – mad – in every case, the wife is faithful and subservient to the husband. Even the husband goes out of home,vānaprastha,the wife also goes with him. When he takessannyāsa,at that time there is no accompanying of wife. Otherwise, ingṛhasthalife and evenvānaprasthalife, the wife is the constant companion and subservient. Gāndhārī – her husband was blind. So when the marriage settlement was done, she was not blind, but she voluntarily became blind by wrapping cloth over her eyes. There are instances in the Vedic literature. The wife remains always faithful and subservient to the husband. That is her perfection. The Americans may not like this idea, but that is a different thing.”\nA five-person TV crew arrived at Prabhupāda’s apartment – four women and a male assistant. Obviously they were making a point. While the crew set up their lights and equipment, Prabhupāda sat serenely behind his low desk, a few of his disciples sitting before him on the floor.\nThe interviewer first asked Prabhupāda about his solutions to America’s problems. Comparing society to the human body, Prabhupāda replied that while all parts of the body were important, the head was the most important. Without a properly functioning head, the person (or society) was mad. There was need, therefore, for training first-class men.\n“Where do women fit into these four classes?” the newswoman asked. Śrīla Prabhupāda duly repeated that woman, being subordinate to man, had her position according to the position of her husband.\nAnd so it went. The questions were challenges – “Do you think I’m inferior to you?” The interviewer was out to make Prabhupāda appear prejudiced, but he spoke only pure philosophy.\n“Spiritually they are all one,” Prabhupāda said. Yet he emphasized a distinction, materially, between man and woman. “For example,” he said, “women can bear children, but the man cannot. Is it possible for the man to become pregnant?”\nInterviewer: “What happens when women are not subordinate to men?”\nPrabhupāda: “Then there is disruption, social disruption. Therefore in the Western countries there are so many divorce cases, because the woman does not agree to become subordinate to man.”\nInterviewer: “What advice do you have to women who do not want to become subordinate to men?”\nPrabhupāda: “It is not my advice, but it is the advice of the Vedic knowledge that woman should be chaste and faithful to man.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda returned to the point that women bear children but men cannot. “By nature’s way,” he said, “as soon as you get children you require support from the husband. Otherwise you are in difficulty.”\nInterviewer: “Many women have children and have no support from their husbands. They have no husband.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then they have to take support from others. You cannot deny that. The government is giving you support. But the government is embarrassed. If the husband supports the wife and children, the government is relieved of so much welfare contribution. So that is a problem. Man and woman unite. The woman becomes pregnant, and the husband goes away. Then the poor woman is embarrassed with the child. She has to beg from the government. So do you think it is a very nice thing? The Vedic idea is that woman should be married to a man and the man should take charge of the woman and the children so that they do not become a burden to the government or to the public.”\nInterviewer: “What about women who do not have children?”\nPrabhupāda: “Well, that is another unnatural thing. Sometimes they use contraceptives. They kill children – abortion. That is also not very good. These are all sinful activities. One has to suffer for them.”\nIt was a heated interview – the feminist interviewer set on disparaging Prabhupāda for his outrageous remarks. Yet he remained strong and uncompromising, arguing in such a way as to point out many anomalies of materialistic civilization.\nPrabhupāda didn’t discriminate against women as a class and in fact gave women in his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement the same opportunity as men. Although the reporter misunderstood him, labeling him as a male chauvinist, actually he was compassionate. According to the Vedic view, women should be protected from exploitative men. Prabhupāda was aware that his words were not being appreciated, but he continued, hopeful that the truth would prevail and that intelligent people would understand. The important point was liberation, not temporary social or sexist stances.\nAfter the TV crew left, Prabhupāda continued the discussion. He said that their becoming angry showed their defeat. They were unwilling to accept logic.\nPrabhupāda: “This women’s liberation is not successful. It has caused disaster. When the women become dependent on the welfare gift of the government, then the government has to raise taxes heavily for this purpose. If they think it is not a problem, then what can be said? By nature’s way, if the husband takes care of the wife and children, this problem is solved immediately. But the man takes advantage and goes away after making the woman pregnant. And the woman is embarrassed, and the government is embarrassed.”\nDevotee: “And the child grows up to be a criminal.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, that is another problem. So they are not far-seeing. Therefore we have to take advice from Kṛṣṇa. We are spreading this knowledge that you take your counsel from Kṛṣṇa, then you will be happy.”\nSatsvarūpa: “Śrīla Prabhupāda, if we speak these things on television and the newspapers and people become angry, if all the people become angry like she just did, is it still good propaganda for us?”\nPrabhupāda: “No. Then we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. But in theBhagavad-gītāeverything is discussed –varṇa-saṅkaraand the first-class man, the second-class man. If you have to push on the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, then we have to discuss. But if they do not like, better to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don’t discuss anything. If you are not agreeable to hear fromBhagavad-gītā,then let us chant together Hare Kṛṣṇa – that’s all. But these things are discussed in theBhagavad-gītā.There it is said that when there is unwanted population and it is increased, then it becomes hell. So if you want to increase the hellish persons, then don’t discuss. But if you think it is a problem, then discuss.”\nSatsvarūpa: “Asbrāhmaṇaswe have to be truthful. In Hong Kong they asked you what you thought of thatguruwho says he is God. You said you could not help yourself, and you spoke out.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, I said he is a great cheat. What can I say? And now it has been proven. As I said in my bookEasy Journey to Other Planets,this moon excursion is childish, and that has also been proven now. Now they don’t talk about the moon excursion. Because they are a failure.”\nThe article continued, implying that Śrīla Prabhupāda was a male chauvinist. “He said women do not figure in his class system except as daughters or wives. An unmarried woman is presumably classless.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda chuckled in the back seat of the car and remarked, “That is a fact. She is prostitute, that’s all. If you classify, then she is prostitute. There is no other way.”\nThe devotee continued reading.\n“So it is not bad,” said Prabhupāda. And he offered his own positive proposal for women in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. “Our policy should be that at Dallas Gurukula we shall create first-class men. And we shall teach the girls two things: how to become chaste and faithful to their husband and how to cook nicely. If they have these two qualifications, then I will take a guarantee to get them a good husband. So try to do that.”\nAt the park Prabhupāda was joined by several carloads of devotees. Followed closely by a dozen eager disciples, he proceeded down a path that ran among many tall shade trees along the shore of Lake Michigan. Since the walkway was wide enough for only a few devotees to walk abreast, most of the devotees fanned out onto the grass, trying to keep within hearing distance of Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“Ordinary education is sufficient,” Prabhupāda was saying “ – ABCD. This is nonsense – big, big education and then later on become a prostitute. To make them prostitute doesn’t require education. So in Dallas Gurukula there is no problem. Educate the girls how to become faithful, chaste wife, how to cook nicely. Let them learn varieties of cooking. Is it very difficult? These two qualifications. There are many stories such as of Damāyāntī, Pārvatī, Sītā – great women in the history. Our girls should read their lives. And by fifteen and sixteen years they should be married. If they are qualified, it will not be difficult to find out a nice husband. If a woman is chaste, even though she is not very beautiful, she will be liked by her husband. So train them in that way.”\nBefore starting back, Śrīla Prabhupāda stopped and suggested they all sit together on the grass. A disciple volunteered his woolcādaraas a seat for Prabhupāda, and the devotees all sat down, facing their spiritual master. Special, unexpected occasions like this made them blissful, and the opinions of a TV news reporter or theChicago Tribuneseemed remote and unimportant. The devotees often wished such persons could be present at times like these to see that Śrīla Prabhupāda was not at all like they thought.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda began discussing the proper relations between men and women. “Women and men should live separately,” he said. “That is also essential. Butter and fire must be kept apart. Otherwise the butter will melt. You cannot stop it.”\nDevotee: “Śrīla Prabhupāda, in a purport in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamyou say that even fifty years ago in India the householders had separate quarters in the apartment for men and women, and the husband would not see his wife during the day. Is this the standard we should develop in our movement?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, that is good. The example is that butter and fire should be kept as far apart as possible. Otherwise the butter will melt. The man is butter, and the woman is fire. So this is restricted, even if the man happens to be father, brother, or son.Mātrā svasrā duhitrā vā.One may say that people will not think of sex impulse in the presence of a daughter, mother, or sister. But theśāstrasays no, there is possibility. So they should not sit together. People may say this is only advice for the tenth-class rascal. But the next line of the śāstrasays no:vidvāṁsam api karṣati.It is not the question of the tenth-class rascal, but even first-class, learned, he may be attracted.Balavān indriya-grāmo vidvāṁsam api karṣati.The senses are so strong that they can mislead even the most learned scholar.\n“Lord Brahma was attracted to his daughter. Just see, there is the example. Lord Śiva was attracted by the Mohinī-mūrti. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, ‘Even if I see a wooden woman, I become attracted.’ ” Prabhupāda laughed. “He is giving this information to teach us that it is possible. So, shall we go now?”\nReturning in the car, Prabhupāda asked for news of Indira Gandhi and India. Some of her policies had become highly controversial, and political opposition to her was mounting The latest news was of her emergency rule.\n“If Indira Gandhi takes my advice,” Prabhupāda said, “then I can keep her on the post, and she can do greater service to India. Immediately the whole public will give her support.”\n“What would your advice to her be?” asked Brahmānanda Swami.\n“My first step,” said Prabhupāda, “will be to capture all the hoarders and distribute the grains free. Immediately the public will be obliged to her. There are immense amounts of food grains, and they are simply hoarded. They are not selling without good price. This is going on. Immediately she can win the public. Some of the hoarders should be hanged, so that in the future nobody will hoard. People are hungry, and she says she has got some program to drive away the poverty. This is the point. If she can supply all consumer goods free to the poor for the time being, then immediately the whole population will like her. And the hoarders should be exemplarily punished. Then nobody will hoard. But to remain the leader she requires spiritual knowledge, otherwise it will be another disaster. If she wants to remain leader then she must be a spiritual person. She must become a Vaiṣṇavī.”\nPhiladelphiaJuly 11, 1975Prabhupāda’s receptions were usually large, spontaneous turnouts. The temple population would increase greatly just before his arrival in a city, as devotees from other centers converged. Except for a handful of disciples – the woman preparing Prabhupāda’s meal, the men laying down the last tiles in his room or working on the Ratha-yātrā cart – everyone would go to the airport to greet him.\nAt the airports Śrīla Prabhupāda was accustomed to much fanfare, the rhythmic crash of hand cymbals, the beating ofmṛdaṅgas,and the chanting chorus of a hundred or more happy devotees. Only if they became wild or disruptive would he object. Otherwise, as Kṛṣṇa’s representative, he would be pleased to see an enthusiastic reception, as he collected flowers and obeisances, like a viceroy accepting tribute on behalf of the king. By his grace, the praise and worship was going directly to Kṛṣṇa.\nThus in Philadelphia, as at almost every airport reception, Śrīla Prabhupāda felt satisfied. With loving glances he acknowledged the familiar faces of his spiritual sons and daughters. Devotees stepped forward to place flower garlands around his neck, and the reporters also stepped forward, with cameras, microphones, and notepads. They had not come to offer Prabhupāda devotional praise, and yet they also appeared to be serving him by offering him the opportunity to preach.\nA woman reporter asked, “It has been said that the Kṛṣṇa conscious movement is what some people consider sexist or racist, because certain propensities for women and for blacks have been defined either by the devotees or the Vedic scriptures. I wonder if you would comment on that.”\nShe had spoken rapidly, and Brahmānanda Swami repeated for Śrīla Prabhupāda, “She says you give inferior roles to women and Negroes.” Prabhupāda: “We give equal roles spiritually. Materially, one man is servant, one man is master. How can you avoid this? Do you think everyone will be master, no one will be servant? Materially? Materially one is father, one is son, one is master, one is servant, one is man, one is woman. How can you stop this? But spiritually they are all equal.”\nHere was the same news theme that had begun in Chicago, and here came the same challenges.\nReporter: “So what is happening materially is unimportant?”\nPrabhupāda: “Materially there is distinction. But when you come to the spiritual platform, then when you discern the spirit soul within everything – that is equal. Like you are differently dressed in a red shirt, and I am differently dressed. This difference must be there. There are so many men and women, and they are differently dressed. You cannot say they are all equal by the dress. But within the dress, the living entities, they are the same. We make this distinction materially, but not spiritually.”\n“I would like to ask one question,” said another reporter. “What is it that you are offering that has resulted in such an emotional response from all the people here?”\nPrabhupāda: “Because they are being spiritually educated. We are above the material platform. Therefore we have no distinction that one is American, one is Indian, one is black, one is white. There is no such distinction. Everyone is servant of God. Is that all right?”\nAnother reporter mentioned that there were manygurusand asked why Prabhupāda thought his teaching was the truth.\nPrabhupāda: “Because we speak the truth. We don’t give bluff, saying, ‘I am God.’ We know the actual position – that God is great and we are all servants.”\nThe question had been asked in the typical reporters’ attitude of irreverent interrogation, but Prabhupāda was replying soberly, reflecting on his own position in relation to Kṛṣṇa. “How can I say I am God?” he asked. And he lowered his head. “No, we do not give bluff. We say the real truth. Therefore it appeals. If I say something humbug, it may act for some time, but it will not endure.”\nReporter: “Your celebration is tomorrow. Of what will that celebration consist?”\nPrabhupāda: “Celebration? It is remembering Kṛṣṇa, or the Lord. He with His brother and sister visited Kurukṣetra, a place in India. So in memory of that visit, we observe this Ratha-yātrā.”\n“So again the same question was raised,” said Prabhupāda. “So reply was all right?”\n“Yes,” said Brahmānanda, “it was very nice.”\nPrabhupāda: “Materially there is distinction. You are differently dressed, I am differently dressed. But spiritually there is no distinction.”\nThe chauffeur glanced to the back seat. “If you want any more air in the back, there is a control over there.”\n“We can put on the air conditioner, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Brahmānanda.\n“Oh, all right,” said Prabhupāda. “But sky condition is better.” They opened the windows.\nPrabhupāda recalled that he had been to Philadelphia twice before. In 1969 he had come from New York City with some devotees to lecture at Temple University. And back in 1965, after leaving Butler, Pennsylvania, he had come to the University of Pennsylvania for a meeting with Professor Norman Brown. Ravīndra Svarūpa told how he had been a student at Temple University and had enrolled in Swami Nikhilananda’s class a year after Śrīla Prabhupāda had spoken there.\nRavīndra Svarūpa: “The students remembered you. They told me you had asked Swami Nikhilananda, ‘So you are studyingVedānta.But whatis Vedānta?’ And no one knew. Then you said thatvedameans ‘knowledge’ andantameans ‘end,’ soVedāntameans the end of knowledge, and that is Kṛṣṇa. They had never heard that before, even though they had so many hours of courses inVedānta.”\nPrabhupāda: “That is the difficulty. Those who are foolish people are taking the leading part. One who has no knowledge is taking the part of a teacher. Just like this – one does not know what isVedānta,and he is readingVedānta.It is a very simple truth.Vedameans ‘knowledge’ andantameans ‘end.’ There must be some ultimate goal. But the modern process is that we go on unlimitedly, but we never come to the end. Is it not like that? What do you think?”\nRavīndra Svarūpa: “Yes, it’s a fact. No conclusion.”\nThey passed a large junkyard filled with scrapped automobiles. “Motorcar,” Prabhupāda said.\nKīrtanānanda: “That is the end of their knowledge – a pile of junk.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. Their time is spent in breaking and building, that’s all. They do not inquire, ‘Why breaking and building? Why not permanent?’ That question does not arise. And they cannot solve it. They think this breaking and building is the nature. But we are giving information of another nature, where there is no breaking and building – permanent. But they cannot believe that there is such a thing. We are giving that information, how you can keep yourself eternal. This is the greatest gift to the human society. He wants to live eternally, but he doesn’t know how to live eternally. His energy is being spoiled by the skyscraper building construction. But he is not very serious to construct his body eternal. We are speaking this in our meetings everywhere, but they have no brain to understand.”\nThey rode around the sharply winding curves alongside the Schuylkill River. Passing Fairmont Park, the devotees pointed out to Prabhupāda that it contained a thousand acres of forest land. Prabhupāda asked Kīrtanānanda Swami how far it was to New Vrindaban, and they began talking. When Prabhupāda asked about thegṛhasthasthere, Kīrtanānanda replied, “We are developing very nice householder couples at New Vrindaban. Very good families.”\n“That is essential,” said Prabhupāda. “The peaceful life of householders, that is required.”\n“Thank you very much for your kind reception,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda from his seat in the temple room. “The press reporters were asking me that why do we make distinction between man and woman and black and white? But we make distinction not in that way.” Śrīla Prabhupāda explained that the attempt to make everyone equal materially would be a failure always, just as the United Nations’ attempt at unity was a failure.Bhagavad-gītāstates that one with equal vision recognizes the differences between the bodies, but sees all beings as one spiritually.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued, “If we make unfair distinction between man and woman or black and white, then how in our temple are we all enjoying together? Because we are actually equal on the spiritual platform. We do not say that you are a woman, so you cannot become my disciple. Or you are black, therefore you cannot become my disciple. No, we welcome everyone. So that people may not misunderstand, you can just issue one statement that we say if you want to see everyone equally, treat everyone equally, then you have to come to the spiritual platform, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Materially it is not possible. But the aim should be one. If artificially you do not make distinction, that will not stay.\n“Just like in your country, the blacks and whites, they have equal rights. But why they fight sometimes, racial fight? Because it is on a material platform. Our point is that you come to the spiritual platform and then this equality will be possible. Practically you can see. Here while you are chanting, dancing, the boy is dancing, the father is dancing, the black is dancing, the white is dancing, the young is dancing, the old is dancing. You can see practically – everyone dancing. And they are not artificially dancing like dog, but by spiritual ecstasy.”\nAfter his talk, Prabhupāda called for questions.\nRavīndra Svarūpa: “What is the best way to deal with skepticism?”\nPrabhupāda: “Skepticism – rascalism. [Devotees laugh] We are not going to deal with rascalism. We are going to deal with sense. Skepticism, they do not believe in anything – everything is false. They are so disappointed, they think everything is false. We are not going to deal with such men. What is the use? Is not that skepticism? What is that skepticism?”\nRavīndra Svarūpa: “Disappointment, that’s all.”\nPrabhupāda: “So why should one be disappointed? We say that you should come to the spiritual platform and you will be happy. We want to deliver him from the platform of his disappointment. Sometimes one being very disappointed commits suicide. We say, ‘Why are you disappointed? You come to the spiritual platform and you will be happy.’ So we are not going to accept his philosophy, skepticism, but we want to deliver him from his fallen condition. That is our mission.\n“The living entity, the spirit soul, is by nature happy. There is no question of disappointment. You see Kṛṣṇa’s picture anywhere. How happy they are. Thegopīsare happy, the cowherd boys are happy, Kṛṣṇa is happy. Simply happiness. Where is disappointment? So you come to that platform, and then you will also be happy. Come to Kṛṣṇa, come and dance with Kṛṣṇa, eat with Kṛṣṇa. That is information we are giving. What is the question of disappointment? Come to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa therefore personally comes to show how happy He is in Vṛndāvana. And He is inviting, ‘Come to Me.’ ”\nPrabhupāda continued his ecstatic description of happiness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then concluded, “Is that all right?” Many voices together answered, “Yes!” There was no disappointment or skepticism in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s presence.\nRavīndra Svarūpa had become temple president just after Prabhupāda’s letter had arrived, and he had resolved to have a real Ratha-yātrā cart for 1972. So the devotees had done it – a small cart, but a cart, pulled in procession down to Washington Square Park. By 1973 they had made a large cart, and devotees from other cities had come to help with the festival. Again Śrīla Prabhupāda responded.\nIn the summer of 1974 Ravīndra Svarūpa had written to Prabhupāda about the preaching activities in Philadelphia and had sent photos of their Jagannātha Deities. Śrīla Prabhupāda had been moved by the pictures.\nIn 1975 Śrīla Prabhupāda had written from Denver, assuring the Philadelphia devotees, “Yes, I am coming to your city on Friday morning, July 11, 1975, from Chicago. I look forward to meeting the professors.” Therefore, when the devotees in Chicago had tried to convince Prabhupāda to stay and attend their festival, scheduled at the same time as Philadelphia’s, he had declined.\nShortly after Śrīla Prabhupāda’s arrival it began to rain, all day Friday and all day Saturday. When time came for Prabhupāda’s morning walk and rain was still pouring, he said, “So today I will take my walk by riding.” Getting into his car along with some of hissannyāsīsand G.B.C. men, he set off in the rain for a ride through Fairmont Park. The rain continued on Saturday right up until the time for the Ratha-yātrā parade.\nThe parade was to start at Independence Mall, head down Walnut Street to Broad, circle City Hall, and end on the grassy slope behind the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Prabhupāda rode into the city, where he was to meet the Ratha-yātrā cart halfway through the procession. The rain had stopped, but dark clouds still hung ominously overhead.\nMajestically the large forty-foot-high cart moved down Walnut Street. By the time it reached Eleventh Street, Śrīla Prabhupāda had gotten out of his car two blocks away and was walking toward Lord Jagannātha. A large group of devotees surrounded Prabhupāda, and the devotees on the cart could see him approaching. The two groups joined, and thekīrtanaswelled. Standing before the cart now, Śrīla Prabhupāda got down on his hands and knees and touched his head to the road in obeisance to Lord Jagannātha.\nThis cart was the best yet, Prabhupāda said. He especially liked the large, strong wheels, ornately decorated with small round and diamond-shaped mirrors. Mounting the cart, he took his seat beneath the Deities, and for the first time in days, the clouds parted and the sun shone through.\nNow people started pouring out of offices and stores. They lined the sidewalks and came out into the road to join the procession. As the cart circled City Hall, the sound of the devotees’ singing became magnified, echoing off the tall buildings. The crowd was the largest ever at any Philadelphia Ratha-yātrā.\nHecklers – Christian fundamentalists with big banners reading “Get smart, get saved!” and “Repent or burn!” – were ineffectual amid the large crowd and the uproariouskīrtana.At one point, when Śrīla Prabhupāda appeared particularly satisfied, a devotee on the cart leaned over and asked Śrīla Prabhupāda what he thought of the festival. Prabhupāda replied that he was thinking the American Vaiṣṇavas were now permanently in the West.\nThe park behind the art museum was crowded with people waiting. Śrīla Prabhupāda took his seat onstage and began lecturing over the public address system: “Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish to thank you, the inhabitants of this great city, Philadelphia. You are so kind and enthusiastic in taking part in this movement. So I am very much obliged to you. I am especially obliged to the American boys and girls who are helping me so much in spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the Western countries.”\nPrabhupāda explained how all living entities are eternal but, having taken material bodies, are subject to the tribulations of birth, death, disease, and old age. In the human form, the soul can choose to go back to the spiritual world or to suffer birth after birth in the material world. “But why should we remain in this material body and undergo repetition, change of body?” Prabhupāda asked. “Let us have our original, spiritual body. That is wanted. That is intelligent.”\nPrabhupāda explained the science of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and invited everyone to try it. “We don’t charge anything for this Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,” he said. “We are chanting everywhere, as you saw in this Ratha-yātrā. Our only means is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. And these thousands of men are following, simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇamantra.So you can understand what is the potency of this Hare Kṛṣṇamantra.We did not pay you ladies and gentlemen anything to follow us, but we simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. So it is very potent. You will never feel tired chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. You see practically. You can go on chanting twenty-four hours, you will never feel tired. Therefore it is said,golokera prema-dhana.This chanting vibration is coming from the spiritual world.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda talked about the inner meaning of Ratha-yātrā: Rādhārāṇi’s meeting Kṛṣṇa at Kurukṣetra and trying to bring Him back to Vṛndāvana. “It is a very ecstatic feeling,” he said. “Those who are advanced devotees, they can enjoy.” Concluding his address, he invited everyone to look at the Kṛṣṇa conscious literature and try to understand.\nThe devotees had prepared twelve hundred pounds ofhalavāand large quantities of vegetables, sweets, and fruit punch, which they very efficiently served to the crowd. Prabhupāda was satisfied with everything and returned to his house, while the devotees continued until sunset, feasting, chanting, and hosting thousands of festival-goers.\nMs. Nixon said she was writing a book on the populargurusand had about fifteen questions to ask Śrīla Prabhupāda. “I am going to ask you questions,” she said, “and most of the time I might be able to answer them myself.” Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed to like her, if only because she wore thejapabeads, but some of the devotees flinched at her remark about already knowing the answers to the questions she was about to ask.\n“How did Kṛṣṇa consciousness develop?” Ms. Nixon asked.\n“Kṛṣṇa consciousness is already there in everyone’s core of heart,” replied Śrīla Prabhupāda. “You have seen how during the whole procession they were chanting and dancing in ecstasy. So do you think that is artificial? No. Artificially nobody can chant and dance for hours together. That means the awakening of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda patiently and carefully answered each question –  about Christ, aboutgurus,about the daily lives of the devotees. While discussing the evils of a godless society, he mentioned the slaughter of cows. “It is an innocent animal,” he said. “It is simply eating grass given by God and supplying milk. And from milk we can live. And the gratefulness is – cut her throat. Is that civilization? What do you say?”\n“I agree a hundred percent,” Ms. Nixon replied. “I want you to say these things instead of me. I am asking the questions for others, of course, who do not understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nAgain, the devotees flinched. That Prabhupāda did not always respond to a person’s attitude or nuance did not mean that he was imperceptive. He sometimes chose not to relate to a certain idiom or react to a certain foolishness, like Ms. Nixon’s claims to be an expert on Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And often he simply ignored a person’s trivial conversation or mundane philosophy. But he was always in touch with whomever he talked to, addressing that person’s true self-interest. He knew Ms. Nixon didn’t know the answers to the questions she asked, and he understood that she was, despite her temporarily donnedjapabeads, not inquiring as a submissive disciple. Nevertheless, he was compassionate, answering to enlighten both her and her readers.\nMs. Nixon plunged onward. “How do you feel about women’s lib?”\nPrabhupāda remained silent, and a devotee repeated, “She wants to know about the women’s liberation. What is your feeling about women’s liberation?”\n“That I don’t want to discuss,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “because …” Śrīla Prabhupāda’s serious expression slowly changed to a smile, and then he laughed. Everyone laughed. His Chicago remarks were famous. On the one hand, he didn’t want to start another controversy, but he did want to clear up the issue.\nHe continued, “As you have asked, so I may explain how the foolish women are being cheated by the intelligent men. In your country they have given you liberty. Liberty means equal rights. Is it not? Man and woman have equal rights.”\nMs. Nixon: “They are trying in this country.”\nPrabhupāda: “All right, trying. But you women, you cannot see that this so-called equal rights means cheating the women. Now I say more clearly that a woman and man meet, now they become lovers, then they have sex, and the woman becomes pregnant, and the man goes away. The simple woman, she has to take charge of the child and beg for government alms, ‘Please give me money.’ This is your independence. So you admit this is independence? Or she tries to kill the child. Do you think it is very good independence? What isyouranswer?” Śrīla Prabhupāda looked challengingly at both women. They had asked their questions, now he was asking.\nMs. Jones: “What is my answer to whether or not I was going to kill a child? Is that the question?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, they are killing now, abortion.”\nMs. Jones: “Well, she has made the choice.”\nPrabhupāda: “You have made your choice to kill your child. Is that a very good choice?”\nMs. Nixon: “It’s the worst crime you could make.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda (to Ms. Jones): “Do you think it is very good business?”\nMs. Jones: “I think it is a very complicated question.”\nPrabhupāda: “Therefore I say they are cheating you in the name of independence. That you do not understand. They are cheating you, and you are thinking you are independent.”\nMs. Nixon: “They forget the responsibility that comes with freedom.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, they [the men] do not take the responsibility. They go away. They enjoy and go away. And the woman has to take the responsibility. Either kill the child or maintain begging. Do you think begging is very good? In India, although they are poverty-stricken, still they do not become independent. They remain under the care of the husband, and he takes all responsibility. She has neither to kill the child nor to beg for maintaining the child.\n“So which is independence? To maintain under a husband is independence, or to become free to be enjoyed by everyone? There is no freedom, but still they think they have freedom. That means under some plea the men are cheating the women, that’s all. So in the name of independence they have agreed to be cheated by another class. That is the situation.”\nPrabhupāda explained that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement had the highest regard for women. “But to protect them from this exploitation by man,” he said, “we teach that you do like this, you do like that. You be married, be settled up. Don’t wander independently. We teach them like that. But so far Kṛṣṇa consciousness is concerned, we equally distribute. There is no such thing that ‘Oh, you are a woman, less intelligent or more intelligent, therefore you cannot come.’ We don’t say that. We welcome woman, man, poor, rich – everyone. Because on that platform there is equality. That is equality.”\nNext Ms. Jones began to question. Ever since Śrīla Prabhupāda’s arrival in Chicago, she had been noting what she thought was Prabhupāda’s excessive material opulence.\n“You have said that you are very small,” she began, “and that you are not God. Yet it appears to me, as an outsider, that the devotees treat you as if you were God.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, that is devotees’ duty. Just like a government officer. Personally he is not very important, but so long as he executes the government order, he should be respected as the government. That is the way. Even if an ordinary policeman comes, you have to respect him –  because he is government man. But that does not meanheis respected. If that man thinks, ‘I have become government. People are respecting me,’ then he is foolish. But the etiquette is that when the government man comes, you should give him respect as the government.”\nMs. Jones: “I wonder about the many beautiful material things that the devotees bring to you. For instance, when you left the airport you left in a big, beautiful, fancy car. I wonder about this.”\nPrabhupāda: “That is teaching them how to respect. If you respect a government man as government, then you must treat him like that. If you respect the spiritual master as God, then you must offer him the facilities of God. Otherwise, how should he treat me as God, simply in his mind? No. In action also.”\nMs. Jones: “I am sorry, what was that you said?”\nPrabhupāda: “If the spiritual master is treated as God, so the devotee must practically show how he is treating him as God. God travels by a golden car, so if the spiritual master is offered an ordinary motorcar, still it is not sufficient, because he has to be treated like God. What is this motorcar for God?”\nThe devotees laughed at Prabhupāda’s bold logic. They had never thought of it quite like that: If theguruis God’s representative, then why quibble if he is offered a mere Cadillac of this material world?\nPrabhupāda: “They are still deficient. If God comes to your home, will you bring Him an ordinary motorcar, or would you arrange for a golden car? So your point is that they offer me a nice motorcar, but I say it is not sufficient. They are still lacking to treat him as God. Be practical.”\nMs. Jones didn’t think it was funny. She had another question. Her questions became more challenging. Prabhupāda explained to her how she must have spiritual vision to see things in their proper perspective. “But if you have no eyes – therefore you are envious because they have offered me a nice motorcar. So you have to make your eyes to see. A blind man cannot see. The eyes are to be treated, how to see.”\nMs. Jones had one more question. One of the most difficult things to understand in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, she said, was the Deities. How could someone brought up in the West accept that the Deities represented God?\nŚrīla Prabhupāda first explained that the spiritual soul within the body was the real self. “Therefore,” he said, “as you cannot see the spirit, so you cannot see the Supreme Spirit, or God. But to show His kindness upon you He has appeared just like wood and stone, so that you can see.”\nThe two reporters were finished with their questions, and they thanked Prabhupāda, who then turned his attention to others in the room. When a father of one of the devotees mentioned that he himself professed no religion, Śrīla Prabhupāda replied indirectly that the father was therefore a fool. The man admitted it. The mother, however, was more spiritually inclined, and Prabhupāda praised her, stating that the son takes on the traits of the mother.\nAnother guest spoke. “I would like to ask, Swami, would you pray for me?”\n“I am praying for everyone,” Prabhupāda replied softly. “That is my business. Otherwise, why have I come here?”\nA woman addressed Prabhupāda: “As a mother, I too wish to thank you. My daughter Joy has found Kṛṣṇa consciousness. She has been recommended for initiation tomorrow.”\nPrabhupāda: “So we recommend everyone. Every American should be initiated. That is our recommendation. The sooner you accept this proposal, it is good for you. To know God and love Him. Is there any difficulty? Some have become interested, why not others?”\nPrabhupāda again glanced at the father who claimed to have no religion. “Your son is interested,” he said. “Why the father is not interested? What is the reason?”\nThus the eveningdarśanacontinued, until after a few hours Prabhupāda ended it and distributedprasādam.\nWhen the last guest had left, several of the women devotees asked Prabhupāda about the actual position of his women disciples. He smiled. “When a woman becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious,” he said, “her brain is automatically bigger.” The devotees laughed.\nAs he smiled, his devotees understood him perfectly: whoever became a devotee, man or woman, became more intelligent. Being transcendental to the issue of men’s or women’s rights, Prabhupāda saw beyond the designation of the body. He saw that the criterion for intelligence wasn’t material – one’s sex, race, or nationality – but was one’s desire for spiritual life.\nA woman devotee asked Prabhupāda a further question about the position of women, and he replied, “Of course you are not a woman. You are a devotee.”\nWhile in Philadelphia Śrīla Prabhupāda had spoken out against the process of inductive reasoning. On one morning walk Ravīndra Svarūpa had said, “Prabhupāda, the same criticism that you just made of induction was also made by John Stewart Mill and Bertrand Russell, but they became skeptics. They say, therefore, there is no knowledge at all.”\n“That is another nonsense,” Śrīla Prabhupāda had replied. “That is also speculation – ‘Because I have failed, therefore there is no knowledge.’ ”\nDr. Yogesh Patel, a Western-educated, Indian-born scholar of Buddhism and Māyāvāda Hinduism, taught in the religion department at Temple University. Accompanied by two graduate students, Dr. Patel dropped by one afternoon while Śrīla Prabhupāda was talking in his room with several of his disciples. Ravīndra Svarūpa made the introductions.\nPrabhupāda: “So you are teaching Hinduism?”\nDr. Patel: “Yes.”\nPrabhupāda: “What is that Hinduism?”\nDr. Patel: “I don’t know. You tell me what Hinduism is.”\nPrabhupāda: “You don’t know? You are teaching Hinduism but you don’t know what it is? This is our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara. He is also a Ph.D. Let us get his opinion on this. [Turning to Svarūpa Dāmodara.] What do you think of that? He is teaching, but he does not know.”\nSvarūpa Dāmodara: “Cheater, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That is called cheater.”\nPrabhupāda: “So you have heard his judgment that you are a cheater?” Dr. Patel became angry and raised his voice at Śrīla Prabhupāda. The professor and Śrīla Prabhupāda were immediately into a battle.\nDr. Patel: “You teach me! If I say I don’t know what is religion, then you teach me.”\nPrabhupāda: “A spiritual master is not your servant. First you become shaven-headed like my students, then I will teach you. You have to offer your obeisances and surrender to the spiritual master. Then he will reveal the truth.”\nDr. Patel replied that hedidoffer his obeisances to Prabhupāda when he first entered the room.\nPrabhupāda: “Then my first instruction to you is to stop this cheating.” By now both Śrīla Prabhupāda and Dr. Patel were speaking with raised voices. Most of the devotees were shocked speechless. Some of them, like Brahmānanda Swami, felt compelled to somehow end the meeting.\nPrabhupāda: “You ask me what is religion. My reply is,sarva-dharmān parityajya.Kṛṣṇa says religion meansśaraṇaṁ vraja –fully surrender.”\nDr. Patel: “What do you mean by surrender?”\nPrabhupāda: “You don’t know the meaning of surrender? Give me a dictionary. Let us see.”\nDr. Patel (yelling): “No! I want theSanskritetymological meaning ofsurrender!”\nPrabhupāda: “You don’t want a spiritual master. You want a Sanskrit teacher. We cannot waste our time anymore.” Brahmānanda Swami saw this as his cue. He leaned over to Dr. Patel and asked him to leave, “before you get offensive.” Dr. Patel and Brahmānanda Swami then rose and left the room together.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda remained shaking with anger. The senior devotees looked over at Ravīndra Svarūpa reproachfully. How could he bring such a man to see Prabhupāda? Ravīndra Svarūpa was appalled and frightened. Never before had anyone seen Prabhupāda explode with such anger.\nAfter staying up all night, Ravīndra Svarūpa approached Prabhupāda the next morning with a prepared apology. “Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he began, “I am really sorry that I brought that professor to see you last night. I had no idea he was such a rascal.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda looked up in surprise. “Oh,” he said, “that is all right.” He paused, and then added with quiet satisfaction, “At least he was chastised.”\nDr. Hopkins: “If someone was going to collect a very small section of your work, say one or two verses, what would you want them to collect?”\n“That is stated in two verses,” Prabhupāda replied.“Dharmasya hy āpavargasya…”And he had the translation read: “All occupational engagements,dharmas,are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should never be performed for material gain. Furthermore, one who is engaged in the ultimate occupational service,dharma,should never use material gain to cultivate sense gratification.”\nPrabhupāda had the purport read, and he expanded on it further, explaining how people are only after material gain, neglecting the real purpose of life.\nDr. Hopkins: “Do you think, then, that this message is the most important message that you have to convey?”\nPrabhupāda: “That is the most important message, because you are not this material body. Suppose you have got this shirt. So if you simply try to maintain this shirt, is that a very good intelligence? Without taking care of your person? Similarly, we are spirit soul, and the body is just like dress. So in the whole material world everyone is engaged to take care of the body. Nobody knows what is spirit soul, what is his need.”\nDr. Hopkins seemed pleased to hear such a broad explanation of Vaiṣṇavism. When he asked about Śiva, Prabhupāda explained that although Lord Śiva should not be considered equal to Lord Viṣṇu, he was the best Vaiṣṇava, the chief devotee of Viṣṇu, and he could be worshiped as such.\nAnd Lord Rāma?\nŚrīla Prabhupāda explained that Rāma was an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. Professor Hopkins was pleased to hear this. Prabhupāda explained that Madhva, Rāmānuja, and Viṣṇu Svāmī were all “big, bigācāryas.” Dr. Hopkins then asked about Tukarāma, the saint of Mahārāṣṭra.\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, Tukarāma accepted Viṣṇu as Supreme. He accepted the process of Caitanya Mahāprabhu,saṅkīrtana.And he accepted Caitanya Mahāprabhu as hisguru.So there is no difference between Tukarāma and Caitanya.”\nDr. Hopkins: “So Lord Viṭṭhala and Kṛṣṇa are the same?”\nPrabhupāda: “Lord Viṭṭhala is Viṣṇu.”\nDr. Hopkins: “And the Alvars of Tamil Nadu, Ādivāsī – you accept their teachings also? So the real question is between Vaiṣṇava and others.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, that is the question – Vaiṣṇava and non-Vaiṣṇava. The actual difference is personalist and impersonalist.”\nDr. Hopkins: “You would see the worshipers of Śiva as impersonalists?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, impersonalists. Śaṅkarācārya said that ultimately the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and one can imagine a personal form for the benefit of the worshiper.”\nWhen Dr. Hopkins pointed out that some of the Śiva worshipers seemed to be personalists, Prabhupāda explained the real mentality of the Śaivites, according to Śaṅkara. “ ‘Now I am a devotee,’ ” said Prabhupāda, “ ‘but as soon as I become perfect, I become One.’ That is their theory. ‘In the preliminary state, when I am not perfect, I am worshiping some imaginary form of God. But when I become perfect, there is no need of worshiping. I become One.’ ”\nAs a scholar, Dr. Hopkins was visibly pleased to hear the authentic philosophy of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When Prabhupāda mentioned thesmārta-brāhmaṇasas also being impersonalists, Dr. Hopkins was surprised.\n“It would be very difficult to pick them out,” said Prabhupāda. “Most of the so-called Vaiṣṇavas are impersonalists.”\nDr. Hopkins: “So the deciding test as to whether one is a serious devotee or not is not only whether one is devoted now, but that he sees the goal as perpetual devotion.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, he isnitya-yukta.That means perpetually.”\nDr. Hopkins, considering this criterion, inquired about the position of Sri Aurobindo, who seemed to be beyond impersonalism. Prabhupāda agreed.\n“He says that above the Māyāvāda philosophy there is something else,” Prabhupāda explained. “That isbhakti.But Aurobindo could not understand, because he did not take education from realized persons. He wanted to realize by himself.”\nDr. Hopkins: “So his problem was the effort to do this on his own?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. He did not go through theguru-paramparā.Therefore it will take a long time.”\nDr. Hopkins finally had to leave and thanked Prabhupāda for his time and wisdom. “Why don’t you join us also?” asked Prabhupāda. “The whole human society should join us.” Dr. Hopkins replied that he had been a friend of the devotees for many years and suspected that in the end he might end up as asannyāsī.Prabhupāda pointed out thatsannyāsadidn’t mean a change of dress but rather giving everything to Kṛṣṇa.\nJuly 15, I975Śrīla Prabhupāda had a direct flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco. He and Upendra sat in the first-class section, while Brahmānanda Swami, Harikeśa, and Pradyumna traveled economy class. Viśākhā-devī dāsī had also come, to photograph Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nAfter the plane had reached cruising altitude, a uniformed gentleman emerged from the cabin. Immediately he caught sight of Śrīla Prabhupāda sitting by the window and walked over. When he leaned over and asked Prabhupāda how he was, Prabhupāda saw that the man wanted to talk, so he asked Upendra to get up and give the gentleman his seat.\n“You are the captain?” Prabhupāda surmised.\n“No,” the man replied. “I am a flight supervisor, come to overlook the pilot and the crew. Would it be all right if I asked you a philosophical question?”\nPrabhupāda nodded, apparently pleased.\n“Is everything created by God?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said yes and quoted theVedānta-sūtra: janmādy asya yataḥ.Everything in existence, Prabhupāda said, has its origin in God.\n“Then what is evil?” the flight supervisor asked. “Is evil also God’s creation?”\n“For God there is not good or evil,” Prabhupāda explained. “Everything is good. Goodness is God’s frontage, and evil is God’s back portion. Taking this example, the chest or the back of the body are equal. It is not that when there is some pain in the back side I don’t care for it, I simply take care of it when there is pain in the chest. No. Although it is the back side, it is as important as the front side.\n“So evil and good are also of the same importance? No. For God there is nothing evil. Just like for the sun there is no darkness. But for us there is light and darkness. If you keep your back to the sun, you will find darkness. And if you face the sun, then there is no darkness.\n“We create darkness as soon as we change our position. If instead of remaining in front of God I keep God on the back, then there is darkness. Otherwise, there is no question of darkness. But in the sun as it is, there is no such darkness. Therefore God is all-good. But for us, when we forget God, that is evil. And when we are in God consciousness always, then everything is good. Is that all right?”\nThe man seemed to understand and respectfully accepted the answer. He was about to ask another question when a well-dressed but somewhat drunken passenger came up to them and spoke. Śrīla Prabhupāda looked up at the man and asked, “Are you afraid of death?” The intoxicated man stammered, sobered, and walked away.\nThe flight supervisor inquired again, taking his meeting with Śrīla Prabhupāda as a rare opportunity. “Can you tell me how one can become peaceful?” he asked.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda began quotingBhagavad-gītā, bhoktāraṁ yajña tapasām, and, signaling Viśākhā, asked for a copy of theGītā.The devotees quickly consulted, but no one had aBhagavad-gītā.\nWhen Prabhupāda heard this he became angry, although containing his feelings in the presence of his guest. He then explained to the man that one had to have knowledge of God as the supreme controller, the supreme enjoyer, and the best friend of everyone; only then could one have peace. “Out of foolishness,” Prabhupāda said, “we are claiming the land is our property. Therefore there is no peace. But actually, God is the proprietor.”\nBoth Śrīla Prabhupāda and the flight supervisor enjoyed their talk, and as the fight supervisor excused himself, he heartily shook Prabhupāda’s hand.\nPrabhupāda called for Pradyumna. His eyes glowing in transcendental anger, he reprimanded Upendra and Pradyumna for not having a copy ofBhagavad-gītā;they should have one with them at all times. Pradyumna offered that although he didn’t have Prabhupāda’sBhagavad-gītāAs It Is,he just happened to be carrying an edition by another author. This infuriated Prabhupāda even more. He then ordered Upendra never to travel again without carrying three books:Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is,and the first volume ofCaitanya-caritāmṛtaandŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nBerkeleyJuly 15, 1975Within less than two weeks Prabhupāda had traveled from west coast to east coast and back. This was his first visit to ISKCON Berkeley’s recently acquired headquarters, a large church complex, and as usual, hundreds of devotees from many Western centers had converged to meet him.\nHis arrival address specifically dealt with the position of theguru.Only unto one with unflinching faith in Kṛṣṇa andguru,he explained, is the essence of Vedic wisdom revealed. “Outsiders may think that theguruis very puffed up,” said Prabhupāda, “and he is sitting and taking respect from the disciple. But the fact is that they are to be taught like that, how to offer respect to the spiritual master.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda repeatedly encountered this misunderstanding. A year ago in Paris he had been heckled by radical students who envied his sitting on an elevated seat. And in America the reporters often portrayed him as enjoying material comforts provided by his disciples. But Prabhupāda maintained that despite a plethora of charlatans bringing disrepute to the wordguru,anyone sincerely desiring to learn transcendental science had to go to a bona fideguru,the representative of God.\n“Aguru’sbusiness,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “is to protect the subordinate disciples from falldown. Just like I am traveling all over the world, twice, thrice in a year. My duty is to see that my disciples, who have accepted me asguru,may not fall down. That is my anxiety.\n“Now how can one becomeguruand representative of Kṛṣṇa? Everyone will say, ‘I am representative of Kṛṣṇa. I amguru.’ No. The real thing is enunciated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who says,āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa:‘You just becomeguruon My order.’ Sogurumeans he who is carrying out the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu – not self-madeguru.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that sometimes people gave him much credit for having done a wonderful thing for the whole world. “But,” he confessed, “I do not know that I am a wonderful man. But I know one thing: that I am speaking what Kṛṣṇa has spoken – that’s all. I am not making any addition or alteration. I am presentingBhagavad-gītāas it is. This credit I can take.”\nPrabhupāda continued to stress that thegurumust repeat the message of Kṛṣṇa. If a so-calledguruwanted to be a cheater, that was a different thing. There would always be cheaters and people who wanted to be cheated. Usually such “gurus”cheated by accepting disciples without ordering them to stop sinful acts. “If I say that you can do all nonsense,” Prabhupāda said, “simply take thismantraand give me $125, they will like. So I would have collected millions of dollars if I would have cheated like that. But I do not want that. I want one student who follows my instructions. I don’t want millions.Ekaś candras tamo hanti na ca tārāḥ sahasraśaḥ.If there is one moon in the sky, that is sufficient for illumination. There is no need of millions of stars. My position is that I want to see that at least one disciple has become a pure devotee. Of course, I have got many sincere and pure devotees. That is my good luck. But I would have been satisfied if I could find out only one. There is no need of millions of stars.”\nBut on the first night, at two A.M., the police came by to check. Śrīla Prabhupāda was already up, working at hisBhāgavatamtranslation, when the police knocked loudly on the outside door near his room. Young Mike, who was to receive initiation in a few days, had been posted as a guard. He opened the door, and three flashlights shone into his face. The officers entered and showed their credentials. “You’re not supposed to be sleeping in here,” one of them said roughly.\n“I wasn’t,” said Mike.\n“Come on, we saw you in your sleeping bag.”\n“No,” Mike protested. “I was just lying there because I’m guarding my spiritual master.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda could easily hear the disturbance just outside his room. Other devotees who were spending the night in the building with Prabhupāda came out of their rooms and tried reasoning with the officers about the special occasion of the spiritual master’s visit. One of the policemen began roaming around, checking in corners with his flashlight, opening doors. Now all the devotees in the building, about half a dozen, were standing with the policemen in the hall outside Prabhupāda’s room.\n“Where’s the old man?” one of the policemen asked.\nBahulāśva, the temple president, requested them not to disturb Śrīla Prabhupāda. But the policemen made no attempt at politeness; they were, in fact, overtly nasty. One policeman banged on the window to Prabhupāda’s room.\n“Don’t disturb him,” Bahulāśva requested. “He’s a very elderly man. He’s not sleeping. These are the hours in which he writes, and all these men are his personal entourage. They’re staying here to help him. We are not violating the rules.”\nSuddenly one of the policemen opened Prabhupāda’s door and shone his light in on Prabhupāda’s face. All three policemen peered in, while Śrīla Prabhupāda looked up at them, concerned, yet detached. The policeman shone his flashlight into the corners of Prabhupāda’s simple, dimly lit room. No one said anything, and after about ten seconds they shut the door.\nThe police officers and the devotees continued arguing, the devotees contending that they were not using the building as a residence, the police citing infractions and taking down notes. Warning that they would be back, they finally left.\nThe incident had constituted about a half-hour interruption of Prabhupāda’s work. But as the building became quiet again, Prabhupāda continued translating the verses ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamand speaking his purports into the dictating machine.\nThe reporters, however, seemed to have a fascination for the trivial. In 1968, a reporter in Montreal had dwelt on Prabhupāda’s casual shoes – “Hush-Puppied High Priest.” Nevertheless, for Prabhupāda, press interviews and press conferences were a way of preaching.\nThe press conference was held in the temple and was attended by about a dozen reporters and photographers. Brahmānanda Swami had the reporters write their questions on a piece of paper, so that one of the devotees could read them to Prabhupāda. Prabhupāda asked the photographers not to take pictures during the conference, since it would divert people’s attention.\nDevotee: “Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you comment on opposition to the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in this country?”\nPrabhupāda: “Why should they oppose? What is the reason? If they are Christian or Jewish religious men, so we are advocating you chant the holy name of God. So why should there be objection? Is there any reason for such objection? What is the objection?”\nDevotee: “Some of the objections are that the followers of the Hare Kṛṣṇa sect are on the streets or in the airports bothering people.”\nPrabhupāda: “The airport itself is a botheration. So much sound, so much accident. So why this little botheration they cannot tolerate? That means intolerance. It is full of botheration, and because we are chanting they are very much disturbed. We don’t chant in the airport, but we ask people that, ‘Here is a very good book – you will benefit. If you like, you can take.’ So what is the wrong there? Tell me, what is the wrong? If I give you something very nice, is that wrong? You read any book – we have got fifty books – and you find out any fault in that. If we are distributing some bad literature which is against the social welfare, then you can object. But you see. Bring all our books here and you will see. Any page you open you will find something good. Why are you denying to distribute such literature for the benefit of the people in general? What is the wrong there?”\nDevotee: “One of the things that people say is that the devotees are asking for donations, not just distributing books but asking for money. That’s a bother.”\nPrabhupāda: “But he pays. If he feels botheration, why does he pay? One who feels botheration does not pay. But one who thinks that here is a nice book, then he says, ‘All right, let me take it.’ Why you take this botheration? If it is botheration, how they are purchasing? They are paying their money, hard-earned money. Do you think they are bothered and at the same time they pay?”\nPrabhupāda’s sensible remark made the reporters laugh. Now they began questioning him directly.\nReporter: “What will happen to the movement in the United States when you die?”\nPrabhupāda: “I will never die.”\nDevotees: “Jaya!Haribol!”\nPrabhupāda: “I shall live from my books, and you will utilize.”\nReporter: “Why does the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement not engage in social protest?”\nPrabhupāda: “We are the best social workers. People are fools and rascals, and we are teaching them nice idea of God consciousness. We are the best social workers. We will stop all crimes. What is your social work? Producing hippies and criminals – that is not social work. Social work means the population must be very peaceful, wise, intelligent, and God conscious – first-class men. That is social work. If you produce some fourth-class, fifth-class, tenth-class of men, what is social work? We are not producing that. Just see, here is a first-class man. They do not have any bad habit – illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. They are all young men. They are not addicted to all these things. This is social work.”\nWhen a reporter asked about the political effects of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, Prabhupāda said, “If this God consciousness is spread, then everyone will be brilliantly qualified.” Recalling a discussion from his morning walk on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, he added, “The students are studying psychology, but the result is that they are falling down from the tower in disappointment. And they have protected with glass.”\nBahulāśva explained further what Prabhupāda meant: “In the bell tower on the Berkeley campus, students in the sixties would jump from that tower to kill themselves. So they put glass there to stop the students from jumping. So Prabhupāda was explaining that this is their education, that after getting their education they have to commit suicide.”\nBrahmānanda: “Śrīla Prabhupāda, one press man wanted to know what is this Ratha-yātrā festival. Why is it going on over here in the Western world?”\nPrabhupāda: “If God is the proprietor of everything, He is also the proprietor of the Western world. Is there any dispute? If you say God is the proprietor of the Western world, what is wrong there? So if the Western world has forgotten God, and He comes to remind them, what is the wrong?”\nReporter: “But what is the purpose of the large carts and other things you use?”\nPrabhupāda: “Large cart means God is very great. He requires very great car. [The devotees laugh.] Why should He go in a small car?”\nPrabhupāda continued speaking until all questions were answered. Now whatever the reporters would write was up to them, but Prabhupāda had used the occasion for glorifying Lord Kṛṣṇa and explaining His movement. Whether press conference, public festival, private conversation, or translating, his purpose was the same.\nPrabhupāda: “Everyone now. India also.”\nDevotee: “They are all afraid of using them.”\nPrabhupāda: “Theymustuse it. That is nature’s arrangement. [Chuckling.] That you all die – that is nature’s arrangement.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami: “When someone gets some power, he wants to try it out. Just like there was that demon, Lord Śiva gave him power so that anyone’s head he touched would fall off.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, just like in your country there are so many cars, so that a poor man like me has car always – not an inch move on leg. But because there are so many cars, naturally they must be used. Similarly, there are so many weapons now that must be used. That is the natural sequence. They must use it.”\nBahulāśva: “That is why they have wars, just to use up the weapons.”\nPrabhupāda: “Oh, yes.”\nDevotee: “The only difficulty is that for one person to use the atomic weapon, that means it would be the entire waste of mankind. So everyone is afraid of using the ultimate.”\nPrabhupāda: “Anyway, they must be used. There’s no doubt about it. Therefore we can say there will be war. This is no astrology. It is a natural conclusion.”\nDevotee: “That will be total destruction.”\nPrabhupāda: “Well, total or partial, that we shall see. But they must be used.”\nDevotee: “Under the threat of nuclear war, wouldn’t Kṛṣṇa consciousness be more easy to spread?”\nPrabhupāda: “No. Threat is already there. But they are such fools that they are not afraid of the threat. Threat is already there. Everyone will die – that is the problem. But who is caring for this? They are avoiding this. They cannot take any antimeasures.”\nYadubara: “So it will take a war to bring them to their senses a bit?”\nPrabhupāda: “No, war is already going on. But they are so senseless that they will not come to this. They are so rascal. Therefore they are described asmūḍha –all rascals.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa: “It is very hard to preach to these fools, Prabhupāda.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will be sufficient.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had rarely been so conclusive about nuclear war. Earlier in the year, on a walk in Māyāpur, he had discussed how there would be a World War III, and that talk had become a sensation throughout ISKCON. But before, he had always offered the alternative: if the people of the world could take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the cumulativekarmacould be reversed. But now he said it was inevitable.\nIn Hawaii Yogi Bhajan had also visited Śrīla Prabhupāda to invite him to his Unity of Man Conference, which manysādhuswere already scheduled to attend. Śrīla Prabhupāda had spoken sternly, pointing out that simply gathering people at a meeting was not unity. Real unity could be achieved only if the participants of the meeting agreed to accept the authorized science of God in the revealed scriptures. Now they had come to invite him to a second Unity of Man conference.\nSwami Sushill and Swami Chidananda were particularly enthusiastic in praising Śrīla Prabhupāda and his ISKCON. “Your movement is something different,” said Swami Chidananda. “It’s all over the world, and you have so many thousands of people all over the world. We can’t describe it. It’s so amazing, and in this age how wonderfully it has been done! Without God’s mercy nothing could have been done. That six lakhs of magazines have come out and been distributed in one month – it’s amazing!”\nSwami Sushill added, “You have established the same principles without any change here in a modern way. In Bengal, without yourāśramawe couldn’t have done anything. When we know there is anāśramaof Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we don’t need to worry about anything, where to stay. What strikes me is that you don’t compromise anywhere.”\nThey mentioned the horrible sin of cow slaughter, and Śrīla Prabhupāda told how his movement was protecting cows in New Vrindaban. When Swami Sushill asked how Prabhupāda interested the young people in God, Prabhupāda gave the example that the most popular sweet shop in Delhi was the one where everything was made with pure ghee. “If the thing is good,” Prabhupāda said, “then there won’t be a shortage of customers.” He further pointed out that his teachings were based purely onBhagavad-gītā,surrender to Kṛṣṇa.\nWhen Swami Sushill asked how Prabhupāda got his followers to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, Prabhupāda replied, “It’s God who did it. God says,mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.So that is our duty – just to take shelter of Him. Lord Caitanya says,yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.That is, whoever you meet, just preach the teachings of Kṛṣṇa as in theBhagavad-gītā.I don’t have anyupadeśa[instructions]. It’s just Kṛṣṇa’supadeśa.We are all foolish. We can’t have anyupadeśa.So what are the teachings of Kṛṣṇa? We just keep on saying them. Kṛṣṇa says do like that, and that’s what we do. So this is our secret. I do this, and that’s what I teach to all these people. I am totally against manufactured religion.Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam –just as Kṛṣṇa says.”\nIn reply to Swami Sushill’s question of how people could be brought together, Prabhupāda quoted a verse fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamthat lists many races of the world and explains that all of them can be purified by taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa’s pure devotee.\nPrabhupāda’s guests again invited him to their conference, and Swami Sushill added, “We were very glad to meet you today. We would like to call you sometime in our meeting ofyoga-dharma.”\n“We’ll come,” said Prabhupāda. “What about your fellowship?”\n“It’s called World Fellowship of Religion,” said Swami Chidananda. “Yogiji has made this Unity of Man Conference.”\n“But we invited him,” said Yogi Bhajan, referring to the previous invitation.\nSwami Chidananda: “But now you are having the second one.”\nYogi Bhajan: “Yes, the second meeting is in Mexico. We will call him then as well.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda smiled and said, “I told you before, there is not going to be any unity.” This candid remark made them laugh.\n“You say,” said Swami Chidananda, remembering Prabhupāda’s analysis, “that until everyone is God-minded, until then… ”\n“When God will desire,” said Yogi Bhajan, “then everyone will become God-minded. What’s the great deal about it?”\n“God Himself says,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam –there is suffering. You cannot stay in this world. You have to leave. The main problem is birth, old age, disease, and death. So we are not anxious to adjust these things here, but these are the real problems.”\n“What can we do about birth, old age, disease, and death?” asked Swami Chidananda.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued preachingBhagavad-gītā.Without overtly disagreeing, Prabhupāda’s guests inquired and listened with respect, considering him a great spiritual leader, potent in spreading Hindudharma.\n“He is great,” said Yogi Bhajan. “That’s what I want to learn – how he can do that.”\nThe conversation turned, and Prabhupāda mentioned that Yogi Bhajan was from the Sikh community, which is famous for its brave fighters. “When the British people were defeated,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “it was by the Sikh people. I have seen it. It is due to the Sikhs only. The Sikhs arekṣatriyas.Some of them arebrāhmaṇas,brāhmaṇa-kṣatriyas.”\nSwami Sushill: “Yes, I said to some of my students that you go to Prabhupādajī, and he’ll make youbrāhmaṇa-kṣatriyas.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, let us cooperate like that. You take the work ofkṣatriyas,and we take the work ofbrāhmaṇas.Forbrāhmaṇaswe need brain, and forkṣatriyaswe need strength.”\nAs they spoke about nonviolence, Śrīla Prabhupāda argued that if one does not become God conscious, then he will undoubtedly be committinghiṁsā,or violence.\nYogi Bhajan: “Yes, when they come to their senses, then they remember God.”\nPrabhupāda (laughing): “Here in the West there is onlyhiṁsā,nothing else.” Prabhupāda’s guests laughed with him.\nAfterward, they took some photographs, and Śrīla Prabhupāda invited them, along with some of his disciples, to sit and takekṛṣṇa-prasādamtogether. Śrīla Prabhupāda requested his guests to attend the San Francisco Ratha-yātrā, to be held the next day, and they agreed.\nJuly 20, 1975This was not only the largest ISKCON Ratha-yātrā ever but also the largest gathering of devotees to date, larger even than the international gathering at Māyāpur earlier that year. Preparations at the festival site had expanded to includeprasādambooths, Deity paraphernalia displays, souvenirs, and Prabhupāda’s books. Thousands joined the more than eight hundred devotees in the procession through Golden Gate Park.\nBecause the builders of the carts had decided to make steel wheels instead of the usual wooden ones, difficulty arose. Śrīla Prabhupāda had warned them, “This is your American disease – always changing. Do not change the old design.” But they had already done it. Riding in Subhadrā’s cart, which had wooden wheels, Śrīla Prabhupāda experienced no personal inconvenience. The other two carts, however, did not fare so well; they began to vibrate so severely that support beams had to be added to the spokes during the procession. Soon the wheels became misshapen, and they creaked and rattled as though about to collapse. But somehow, after much difficulty, all three carts completed the course.\nIn the midst of the Ratha-yātrā activities, one of the devotees asked Śrīla Prabhupāda if he had ever attended the Ratha-yātrā festival in Jagannātha Purī. “No,” Prabhupāda replied, “I was having my own Ratha-yātrā.”"

Now Rāmeśvara and Rādhāvallabha reported that work was going on around the clock in all departments and that devotees were determined to meet their deadlines. Most Press workers attendedmaṅgala-āratiat four-thirty A.M., chanted their prescribed rounds ofjapa,and worked all day until late at night, sometimes taking only one meal.\nAdditional editors, painters, photographers, indexers, typists, proofreaders, and layout men had been called in from other ISKCON departments. Everyone was cooperating to fulfill Śrīla Prabhupāda’s desire. It was as though nothing else existed except the task before them.\nKingsport Press, one of the largest printers in the country, had taken the job of printing, agreeing to push back all other assignments to free their presses and bindery for work twenty-four hours a day until all seventeen volumes were printed. A paper company in New York had agreed to supply paper at affordable terms to meet all the deadlines. The BBT’s top photographer was in India photographing places ofcaitanya-līlā,especially in Bengal and Orissa.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda freely gave his time to the artists and the Bengali editors, answering their questions. Several times a day his disciples would come to him about the exact use of Sanskrit and Bengali words. This was not merely a matter of lingual scholarship, since each word had to be translated in light of the previousācāryas’explanations and Prabhupāda’s own Kṛṣṇa conscious realization. Prabhupāda had cautioned disciple editors not to change but to ask.\nThe artists had their usual questions about how things should look according to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s transcendental vision. In their desire to have the paintings completely accurate, they were greedy to ask him almost endless questions. Prabhupāda had said the transcendental paintings of his disciples were windows to the spiritual world; the artists didn’t want their imaginations to obscure the view.\nOne day, Rāmeśvara came into Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room carrying canvases by one of the artists whose proficiency the more experienced artists questioned. The artist in question, Gaurī-devī dāsī, was a book distributor with artistic talent, pressed into emergency service for the book production marathon. Rāmeśvara showed Śrīla Prabhupāda her painting of the Guṇḍicā temple. Prabhupāda’s verdict: “Oh, this is very nice.” One of the senior artists was present and pointed out several technical errors, but Prabhupāda replied, “A blind uncle is better than none.” Besides, he said, the painting showed a devotional spirit the readers of the book would appreciate.\nDue to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s presence in Los Angeles, the book production marathon intensified. Even without attending Prabhupāda’s morning walks or classes or evening readings in the garden, the Press workers felt ecstasy. All day they worked at what Prabhupāda wanted most, and to take time off to go see him, they reasoned, would be selfish. Giving all their energy for Kṛṣṇa, they felt blissful.\nThe Press was busy day and night. To see devotees slumped over their desks or typewriters or lying beside their easels at two or three in the morning was not unusual. Proofreaders saw manuscripts come into and out of their hands so quickly they could hardly bear it. An artist might fall asleep before an uncompleted painting and awaken to find it being finished at another artist’s easel.\nRāmeśvara, running on very little sleep, orchestrated everything, including the photographer in India, the printer, and the paper company. Sometimes he would work directly with Rādhāvallabha on various aspects of the production.\nRādhāvallabha had set the deadlines, and he kept to them at all costs. To the Press workers, he seemed to be present everywhere – encouraging them, bringing them supplies, seeing to their needs, begging and coercing them to complete their quotas. But one night he took a break and entered Prabhupāda’s room during an informal gathering of devotees. Prabhupāda, his eyes closed, his head gently rocking, was listening to a tape of himself singingbhajanas.Opening his eyes and seeing Rādhāvallabha seated among the others, he said, “I am keeping you,” and again closed his eyes.\nOne of the devotees spoke up and said, “Oh, no, no, Prabhupāda. You’re not bothering us.” But another devotee turned to Rādhāvallabha and said, “I think Prabhupāda was talking to you.” Rādhāvallabha realized what Prabhupāda meant; he was telling him to go back to work. It was as if Prabhupāda were actually saying, “Why are you sitting here looking at me? Get back to work.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was pleased with the sincerity of his disciples. Seventeen books in two months he had asked them to produce, and they, rather than try to explain to him why this was impossible, had taken the order so seriously that they could not conceive of rejecting or changing or modifying it. Instead of modifying the order, they had modified their lives. They had gone beyond the realm of routine work into the realm of extraordinary effort. As a result, both they and Prabhupāda felt great satisfaction. As Prabhupāda said, it was all an arrangement for the satisfaction of Lord Caitanya and the previousācāryas.\nFrom Prabhupāda’s point of view, his touring was imperative for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As he had said in his arrival address at Berkeley, “I am traveling all over the world, twice, thrice in a year. My duty is to see that my disciples, who have accepted me asguru,may not fall down. That is my anxiety.”\nPrabhupāda’s concern was for his disciples, but also for all people. Distressed by the fallen and ignorant state of humanity, especially in the West, he wanted to help the English-speaking world, as his spiritual master had ordered. This had been his spirit two years ago in Calcutta, when he had risen from his sickbed and flown to London to take part in the Ratha-yātrā. This was his great desire: to preach in the West, where people were so strongly under the grip of speculative philosophies, denying God and glorifying sense enjoyment. The mass of people would not easily change their ignorant ways, but if he could make only one person a pure devotee, he said, then his work would be successful.\nPrabhupāda would work intensively with his important India projects for a few months, but then would always return to the West to again tour and preach. Both were required – developing his projects in India and touring the West. When Yogi Bhajan and company in Berkeley had expressed their amazement at how Prabhupāda was personally maintaining his disciples by traveling all over the world, Prabhupāda had admitted that it was difficult and that he was trying to train his G.B.C. secretaries to lead his movement. But so far, it seemed that as long as he had the power to do so, he would continue to travel.\nLaguna BeachJuly 25, 1975Laguna Beach was about a two-hour drive south of Los Angeles. The temple, a house near the beach, was crowded with guests and visiting devotees. After Prabhupāda had taken his seat upon the newly upholsteredvyāsāsana,some of the temple leaders came forward one at a time and bathed his feet.\nIn the course of his lecture, Prabhupāda spoke against taking intoxicating drugs: “Is there anyone here who can say, ‘I am the controller’? Is there anyone who will answer this? You may think that you are the controller, but you are controlled by drugs.” The city of Laguna Beach was notorious as an illicit drug center. Prabhupāda had come not to flatter anyone with sentimental spirituality but to cut through their illusion. Bathing the feet of the spiritual master was good, but to be a genuine devotee one had to strictly follow the regulations. One had to choose whether to be controlled by drugs or by Kṛṣṇa.\nPrabhupāda stayed next door to the temple in a neighbor’s house. His first visitor was Ṛṣi dāsa, who had given up his initiation vows and fallen away from Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sporting long, curly hair and a beard, he had casually dropped by to pay a little visit to his former spiritual master. Prabhupāda received Ṛṣi warmly, and they both exchanged smiles and laughed. Ṛṣi’s demeanor, however, was brazen, almost defiant, and he showed no contrition. Prabhupāda was not very happy to see the state of this boy to whom he had awarded thesannyāsaorder a few years before.\nIn earlier years, Prabhupāda had cried when a dear disciple had left him. In those days, the fall of a disciple had been rare, almost unheard of. But over the years Prabhupāda had seen more casualties, even among his G.B.C. leaders andsannyāsīs.In 1967, when one of his first disciples, Kṛṣṇā-devī dāsī, had left her husband, Subala, and gone off with a boyfriend, Prabhupāda had consoled Subala by reminding him how rare it was that one could become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. “The wonderful thing is not that Kṛṣṇā dāsī has left,” Śrīla Prabhupāda had said, “but that we can stay in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nAlthough devotees left Kṛṣṇa consciousness for various reasons, Śrīla Prabhupāda saw them all as having been tricked by illusion. The result was almost always the same, whether the defector left on the plea of a new religion, or new economic opportunities, or whatever; usually he or she would take up a life of sense gratification, abandoning the strict path of self-realization.\nThis was certainly true of Ṛṣi. When Prabhupāda asked him what he was doing with his life, he laughed and said he was playing saxophone. There was no need to ask him whether he was chanting sixteen rounds or following the four rules. But Ṛṣi wanted to assure Śrīla Prabhupāda that he was doing fine. “I think I have more freedom now,” said Ṛṣi.\n“Do you think you have freedom?” Prabhupāda challenged.\n“Some,” Ṛṣi replied. “By studying and working.”\n“What is your age?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“Twenty-nine.”\n“Are you free not to become older?” Śrīla Prabhupāda persisted.\n“No.”\n“Then what is your freedom?”\nṚṣi gave a short laugh. “I don’t care.”\n“That’s all right,” Prabhupāda replied, “but I am researching. I am now seventy-eight. I don’t wish to die, but I am forced. But you too are forced to become old. No one wants to be old.”\nRecalling some of the Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy, Ṛṣi tried to argue against Prabhupāda, saying that although he was forced to grow old, according to transmigration of the soul he would be free after death. And anyway, there were other freedoms.\nPrabhupāda stuck to his original point and said, “Death is inevitable. Old age, no one wants. Everyone wants youth. Even an old man goes to the beach for health. I want youth, but I cannot have it. So where is the freedom?”\nPrabhupāda then spoke at length, for Ṛṣi’s benefit as well as for the benefit of the other devotees in the room. Persons under the influence ofmāyā,he said, declare that they are free. The drug addict or the drunkard thinks he is free – to lie down on the street. Yet his actions involve him in the strict laws of material nature. The outlaw declares himself free from the laws of the state, but he is put into jail. What is the use of his saying he is free? “Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,” Prabhupāda explained, “that ‘Whatever little freedom you have got, just surrender that freedom to Me.’ ”\nPrabhupāda’s comments on false freedom were to the point. Within two hours of his arrival, he had already exposed the Laguna Beach mystique. Ṛṣi continued to smile and argue, but before Prabhupāda he was just another youth with no real answers. Prabhupāda was not interested in debating; he wanted to help his disciple. Ṛṣi, however, was using whatever freedom he had to defy Kṛṣṇa’s representative, trusting instead in his youth, his intoxication, and his music.\nThe door opened. “These are some professors, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” announced a devotee, “who form part of our congregation.” Prabhupāda greeted the new guests and asked that they sit up front on cushions.\n“I was talking with this boy about freedom,” said Prabhupāda. “So I say there is no freedom for us. We are always dependent. What is your opinion about it?” One of the professors said he agreed, and Prabhupāda continued speaking. He talked with the professors for more than an hour.\nNear the end, Upendra’s three-year-old son, Saumya, walked up to Prabhupāda from the back of the room. Prabhupāda gave him some money that was on the desk, and the boy ran back to his mother and gave her the money. “Yes. When I was young,” Prabhupāda reminisced, “if I got money I would take it to my mother. But then when I would become angry at her, I would demand it back. Sometimes I would steal money from my mother’s purse and go watch Charlie Chaplin movies.” His favorite scene was in a film calledHard Times,he said, when Charlie Chaplin sat down at a table with a knife and fork to eat a boot.\nSan DiegoJuly 27, 1975Śrīla Prabhupāda rode down the San Diego Freeway in the predawn darkness, on his way to San Diego to attend a festival in Balboa Park. On the way he passed through San Clemente, where former president Richard Nixon was staying. Prabhupāda had followed Nixon’s exposure and resignation and had often mentioned it in his lectures, sometimes as an example of how even the most powerful men are subject to anxiety and loss, sometimes to illustrate the need for proper training in the four natural social orders.\nA devotee mentioned that Mr. Nixon lived here with no position, scorned by his countrymen. “Then you should go and preach to him,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. Since the man had lost everything and was lamenting, he said, he might be receptive to hearing about the Absolute Truth. Prabhupāda had attempted a similar approach to Mahatma Gandhi.\nAt Balboa Park Prabhupāda was pleased with the devotees’ booths and colorful tents and the stage they had erected in the meadow. He had just begun addressing the large crowd when a man in the audience began shouting. Prabhupāda asked what he was saying, and a devotee explained, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, the man says he wants to have sex more than once a month.”\n“He is creating disturbance,” said Prabhupāda into the microphone.\nAfter a tense moment, Prabhupāda continued his lecture. “So, as this man is talking about sex, so this whole material world is enchanted by sex.” Taking the shouted protest as a new focus for his speech, Śrīla Prabhupāda quoted Prahlāda Mahārāja’s statement that all material entanglement begins from sexual enjoyment, which in comparison to transcendental pleasure is paltry and abominable. “But real happiness,” Prabhupāda asserted, “is above the senses. Whatever we enjoy with the gross senses is temporary, but permanent enjoyment is transcendental.\n“So this man,” he continued, “was suggesting he wants sex at least once in a month. Yes, that is allowed. Five days after the wife’s menstrual period the husband and wife can have sex for begetting rightful children.” Prabhupāda used the Vedic technical term,garbhādhāna-saṁskāra,to describe the process of purifying sex within marriage. The devotees were astonished that before a crowd of sexually liberated Southern Californians Prabhupāda was espousing responsible, legitimate sex. Usually he discussed such matters, if at all, in letters to householders. But if the Americans were intent on sex, then Prabhupāda would let them have it. But he stressed responsible, restricted sex. Otherwise, by irresponsible sex, one has to suffer.\n“Sex life is not denied,” Prabhupāda said, “but one must take responsibility for sex life. Otherwise he becomes entangled in so many sinful activities. You can have sex life once in a month. That is prescribed. Because a woman has once in a month menstrual period. So sex life is meant for simply begetting nice children, not for sense gratification. If it is in regulative form, the world may not become hell. If it is in irregulative form, then the whole world will be hell. Sex life is not denied. Sex life is not denied, but in a regulated form, so that you can get nice population and live very happily.\n“Especially at the present moment, if you can produce children to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, that would be a great service to the Lord, because we want a Kṛṣṇa conscious population. Otherwise this world is going to hell. There were great empires like the Roman, Greek, and later on the Mogul empire, the British empire. Then there was Napoleon, Hitler, Mussolini. So all these powerful empires and men have come and gone. Only a name is there now. Nothing is remaining. So I came to your country, America. I decided to come here because I heard your country is very nice, and when I came here I saw actually that your country is very nice – your cities, your buildings. Your men also – because mostly my students are Americans, and they help me very kindly to push on this movement.\n“So I have studied the American life very nicely. They have a good heart. The only thing that is wanting is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For want of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, despite all your opulences, you are becoming confused and frustrated. I hear that out of three, one man is a patient of a psychiatrist. Why? Why are you unhappy? Why should you be unhappy? You have got everything – enough food, land, money, intelligence. Why should you be unhappy? The cause of this you should try to find out. The cause is that without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, without God consciousness, nobody can be happy.”\nThe outdoor audience was now quiet and attentive. Prabhupāda spoke for about forty minutes, ranging over different areas of Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy, and concluded with a request to the American men and women to seriously cooperate in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thereby find happiness. His talk was greeted with cheers, and the devotees continued to host the crowd throughout the afternoon, chanting and dancing and distributingprasādam.\nIn the newspapers also had been much coverage of a U.S. merchant ship, theMayaquez,which, when sailing within the twelve-mile limit of Cambodia, had been seized without warning. President Ford had taken a strong stand, sending in the U.S. Marines. Fifteen Marines had been killed and fifty wounded in recovering the vessel, and the U.S. had bombed Cambodia. It was proper, Prabhupāda said, for the U.S. to take a strong stand in defending its citizens abroad. “Yes, America should be strong,” he asserted. “But first of all they should become Kṛṣṇa conscious. If they were actually a Kṛṣṇa conscious nation, they should declare, ‘If you touch the hair of one of our men, there will be a fight.’ ”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda spoke strongly, giving the devotees a vision of a powerful America leading the world in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And this stirred within them hopes for a pure patriotism, such as in the ancient Vedic culture, when the world had been ruled by God conscious leaders.\nRāmeśvara: “But when we tell people that they may take their next birth as an animal or bird, they say that’s all right, because these creatures are happier than the humans.”\nPrabhupāda: “But because you are rascal, you do not know that you can becomemorehappy – go back home, back to Godhead. That you do not know.”\nDevotees liked to bring before Śrīla Prabhupāda all kinds of topics for his comment. Conversations would jump from one thing to another as devotees sometimes brought up horrendous examples of contemporary degradation or sometimes tested their own doubts by posing as agnostics. Or sometimes they would simply bring to Prabhupāda’s attention ordinary sights and sounds. Whatever the topic, Prabhupāda showed the devotees how to see things from the transcendental perspective. And thus he also showed to them his own purity and humanness. When a devotee told Prabhupāda that Balboa was the first man to see the Pacific, Prabhupāda at first seemed impressed, but a moment later he scoffed, “Everyone was already there. That they do not know. The Pacific and Atlantic oceans are mentioned in Kalidāsa Kavi’s bookKumāra-sambhava.They are all mentioned – Pacific, Atlantic oceans. These fools do not know anything. They say, ‘I am the first man to come,’ as if before him there was no man. Just see!”\nPrabhupāda complimented the devotees on the previous day’s festival in the park and advised them to hold such festivals every day. “You are so rich,” he said laughingly, “you can do it. Continual festival. Tell them, ‘Come on. Takeprasādam.Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.’ Just like – what is that? Who told me? – continual massage.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami: “Yes, they have twenty-four-hour massage parlors.”\n“Twenty-four hours,” Prabhupāda said, laughing. “Similarly, twenty-four-hours freeprasādam –come on. But they are not hungry. Not for that.”\nWhile walking to a meadow, they came upon a man standing on his head. “Is this our man?” Prabhupāda asked.\nThe devotees laughed and replied, “No,yoga.”\n“He wants to be immortal,” said Rāmeśvara.\n“No,” said Prabhupāda. “This keeps them healthy.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa: “It’s good for the body?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes,śīrṣāsanait is called, sitting on the head.Śīrṣāsana, padmāsana, yogāsana –there are so manyāsanas.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa: “We don’t practice those.”\n“Yes, we have no time from sleeping,” said Prabhupāda sarcastically. The devotees laughed at his cutting remark. “Otherwise,” Prabhupāda continued, “this is not bad. This is not bad. It keeps good health, thisyoga-āsana.”\nHearing Prabhupāda’s surprising praise ofhaṭha-yoga,a devotee asked the inevitable – “So if we have time, can we do that?”\nBy now they had finished their walk and had arrived back at the cars. Śrīla Prabhupāda chuckled, as if aware that he was being baited with a controversial question. “Hare Kṛṣṇa,” he said. On getting into the car, he added, “Not required.”\nDallasJuly 28, 1975“Swami, why are you here?” asked a reporter at the Dallas – Forth Worth Airport.\n“This is my home,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. The reply delighted his disciples. “I have got so many children, grandchildren. So I have come to see them.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had written about Dallas Gurukula in his commentary on theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, he had written, was training a new generation of Vaiṣṇavas in its own school in Dallas, Texas.\nMore than a hundred boys and girls were now enrolled, and Śrīla Prabhupāda liked to visit here whenever he toured the United States. Here, as in other ISKCON projects in the U.S., he involved himself little in the management; but he visited, making himself available to the teachers, who were always ready with questions. Since there was no precedent in the West for Kṛṣṇa conscious education, and since the devotees wanted to develop the school just as Prabhupāda desired, they felt they had to ask him about curriculum, teaching methods, hygiene, recreation, and so on.\nIn the one-hundred-degree weather, the schoolboys wore no shirts, and Śrīla Prabhupāda ran the electric fan in his room. As soon as he arrived in his quarters, he asked that all the children and adults come into his room, and one by one they entered his room, held out a hand, and Prabhupāda gave them a largerasagullā.That evening he sat in a rocking chair on the lawn behind the temple, while devotees fanned him with a large peacock fan and locusts droned loudly in the trees. He sat there with his disciples amid many thrivingtulasīplants, listening to a reading from theKṛṣṇabook. This was as much a lesson in how to conduct agurukulaas were his answers to the teachers’ intricate questions. At Gurukula, everything should be based on chanting and hearing about Kṛṣṇa.\nBrahmānanda Swami was reading about Kṛṣṇa’s rescuing His beloved Rukmiṇī, when suddenly Śrīla Prabhupāda interrupted and said that when they had been escaping on Kṛṣṇa’s chariot and the other princes had been attacking, Rukmiṇī had taken the reins and had driven the chariot. Kṛṣṇa had then taken His bow and arrows and had defeated His opponents. The devotees were amazed. Many of them were keen students ofKṛṣṇabook, and nowhere was that particular detail mentioned. Never before had any of them heard of Rukmiṇī’s taking the reins, nor had they ever thought of her in that way. But Prabhupāda assured them that she had fearlessly driven Kṛṣṇa’s chariot during the fight.\nWhile Prabhupāda was speaking, Dayānanda, the Gurukula headmaster, stretched out his leg to find a more comfortable position, and Prabhupāda turned to him and said sternly, “Do not put your feet near Tulasī. She is a pure devotee.”\nWhen Brahmānanda read a prayer in theKṛṣṇabook describing Kṛṣṇa as the creator of the material elements, Prabhupāda spoke up. “If we do not accept that Kṛṣṇa made the sky,” he challenged, “then who made it?” The blue of the Texas sky was now fading into twilight, and guests and devotees alike looked up at the sky and then back to Prabhupāda.\n“According toBhagavad-gītā,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “Kṛṣṇa made the sky– bhūmir āpo ’nalo vāyuḥ kham.So we should study like this –ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ.The sky is the greatest material thing, but He created it. In this way, study Kṛṣṇa. Not just studying Kṛṣṇa with thegopīs –then you will misunderstand. But the more you understand Kṛṣṇa, the more you will become His staunch follower. Unauthorized persons never paint Kṛṣṇa creating the sky. They always want to see Kṛṣṇa dancing with thegopīs,and in this way they try to support their own lusty activities.”\nAside from claiming that Śrīla Prabhupāda was barefoot (actually he had worn shoes but had removed them when sitting cross-legged), the article pointed out a controversy around the Kṛṣṇa devotees in Dallas. The article cited ISKCON’s injunction against officials of the Dallas – Fort Worth Airport, who had forbidden them to distribute literature and take donations.\nOn hearing the article, Śrīla Prabhupāda had commented, “This is good literature. It should be encouraged.” By reading it, people would become sane, and they would understand their constitutional position. Otherwise the people would go on being perturbed by crime and wondering what to do.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was particularly interested in the newspaper’s version of his reply to the question about Indian politics.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was repeatedly being asked about Indira Gandhi. The U.S. government was critical of her newly instituted emergency rule, and particularly in Chicago, the reporters had tried to construe Prabhupāda’s comments about women as criticism of Prime Minister Gandhi. Both in Chicago and Dallas Śrīla Prabhupāda had stressed that he was not much concerned with politics, although he indicated that politics were useless without Kṛṣṇa.\nEager to keep good relations with the Indian government, Prabhupāda did not like to speak publicly against India’s leaders. He had often expressed a desire to meet with the Prime Minister to assure her of the good work the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was doing for the benefit of India and the whole world, and to request her assistance. In India, visas had always been a problem for the devotees. They had to continually leave the country and their service to renew their visas and then reenter, at great cost. Now some devotees, especially in the Māyāpur area, were being asked to leave the country because of America’s stance against Indira Gandhi’s political actions. Recently Prabhupāda had received word from the devotees in Delhi that they were trying to arrange such a meeting. So he liked the favorable statements on Indira Gandhi in theDallas Times Heraldand asked that the article be saved.\n“Is it due to the heat, Śrīla Prabhupāda?”\n“I do not know why, but now I am feeling headache and some spasm.”\n“Should we cancel the trip this morning?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda didn’t answer. He admitted, however, the heat may have weakened his digestion. When asked if the food was to his liking, he replied, “Not very all right. Constantly change of hand is not good.” Brahmānanda Swami suggested that another difficulty for health was the constant flying, but when he again suggested postponing the flight to New Orleans, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “No, no,” and continued forward.\nJuly 31The weather was stormy en route to New Orleans. Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the first-class section with Upendra, was looking out the window when the “Fasten Your Seat Belt” announcement came, just ten minutes before the scheduled landing.\nSuddenly the plane dropped violently. Passengers screamed and clutched their armrests, bracing themselves. Upendra, frightened speechless, thought,If I have to die, it’s all right, because Prabhupāda is here.The downward plunge stopped abruptly, but then the plane began to lurch and roll, tossed by turbulent air currents. Overhead bins snapped open, and articles fell out, bouncing off passengers and onto the floor. Śrīla Prabhupāda turned to Upendra. “Why is it rocking?” he asked.\n“It’s a storm,” replied Upendra. He could see that Śrīla Prabhupāda was calm. His expression was one of irritation, like over some minor incident, as when his lunch would be served late.\nIn wind and downpour, the pilot finally touched the wheels onto the runway, landing without mishap. A sigh rose from the passengers, then cheering and applause. Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed unaffected. He asked Upendra how long a drive it would be to the temple.\nA wide marble staircase led up to the entrance, and Prabhupāda, leaning on his cane, climbed it slowly, as devotees threw flower petals down from the third floor. The entire distance from the car to the house, about 250 feet, was covered with a three-foot-wide white cloth, leading up to thevyāsāsana.Prabhupāda bowed down before the Deities of Gaura-Nitāi, Rādhā-Rādhākānta, and Lord Jagannātha, sat down, but then decided it was too late in the morning to speak. Instead, he went at once to his quarters in the building next door.\nAs soon as Śrīla Prabhupāda reached his room, he was introduced to an official from City Hall who had come from the mayor’s office to present him with an honorary welcome to New Orleans. Prabhupāda graciously accepted a symbolic key to the city and a scroll welcoming and praising him as an honorable visitor. Seizing the opportunity, he began preaching to the man, treating his guest not as a city official but as any other conditioned soul.\nWhen the welcoming flurry had abated and Śrīla Prabhupāda had bathed, takenprasādam,and rested, he called for Nityānanda. When Nityānanda entered, Prabhupāda had sandalwood pulp on his forehead and wore a fresh garland. Nityānanda offered obeisances. Alone in the room with his spiritual master, he felt embarrassed and fearful. Prabhupāda picked up a photo album from his desk containing pictures of the farm in Mississippi. “You know,” he said, “I have come especially to see your farm.”\nThe rain had stopped in Carriere, Mississippi, and Śrīla Prabhupāda looked out across the gently rolling land. The ISKCON farm – cleared land, surrounded by a pine forest – was situated on a ridge. The previous owner had used the property as a horse ranch, and the modern fourteen-room brick house, the large barn, and several sheds were all in good condition. Prabhupāda liked the land. He said it looked just like Bengal.\nMost of the devotees from New Orleans had raced to the farm to be with Prabhupāda, and they crowded into the temple room, waiting for him to give the morningBhāgavatamclass. As soon as he began to speak, however, many flies came, buzzing, landing on his head and body. A devotee began fanning him with acāmarawhisk, but to no avail.\n“Come near,” Prabhupāda said. “Thiscāmarais especially meant for driving away the flies. Even it is touching the body, there is no harm.”\nToward the end of the lecture, Śrīla Prabhupāda began speaking of the farm. “Now this place, I see, although I have not seen all, it is a nice place. Thegṛhasthasmay come here, have some small cottage, grow your own food grains and vegetables, and have your own cow’s milk. Get nice foodstuff, and save time. Why should you go into the city hundreds of miles in a car and again hundreds of miles back and take unnecessary trouble? Stick to this spot and grow your own food, make your own cloth, and live peacefully. Save time and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is actual life.\n“What is this nonsense life – big, big cities, and all these people busy? To see a friend he has to go thirty miles. If he has to see a physician, he has to go fifty miles. If he has to go to work, another hundred miles. So what is this life? This is not life. Be satisfied. A devotee’s life should beprayojana.We require material necessities – as much as is required. No artificial life.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda went on to deprecate the life of “simply machine, machine, machine, machine.” He asked the devotees to show by practical example how to live simply and advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If they could show the example, people would try to follow.\nAlthough Nityānanda and the others had been living on the land for many months, Prabhupāda’s words gave them the real direction and purpose for the project. It was as if he were now breathing life into his project.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda went to his room and sat with Brahmānanda Swami, Satsvarūpa dāsa Goswami, Harikeśa, Jagadīśa, and Upendra. When he began speaking aboutvarṇāśrama,he called for Nityānanda. They should try not to use machines, he said. The men and animals should do the work.\nNityānanda asked whether the householders should produce food cooperatively or as individual families. “They should work together,” said Prabhupāda, “or what’s the use of living in a community center?”\nWhen Upendra asked how the milk should be used, Śrīla Prabhupāda explained what he called the Indian village system. “As Nanda Mahārāja was keeping cows,” he said, “similarly there are many villages. They have a big pan, and whatever milk is collected they put into that pan. It is kept on a fire and is warm. So the whole family can drink milk whenever they like. Then whatever milk remains at night, they have to convert it into yogurt. The next day they use milk and yogurt also as they like. Then after converting the milk into yogurt, whatever remains is stored. If there is sufficient old yogurt, they churn, and then butter comes out. They take that butter, and the water separated from the butter is called whey. So instead ofdāl,they use this whey for eating withcapātīs.It will be very healthy and tasty. Meanwhile, the butter they turn intoghee.There is not a single drop of waste.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that everyone could take as much milk as necessary and that thegheecould be used in ISKCON restaurants in the cities. Curd could also be used in the restaurants for makingsandeśa, rasagullā,and other dishes.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda stressed that the farm be well organized, engaging all classes of men –brāhmaṇas,kṣatriyas,vaiśyas,andśūdras.No laziness or unemployment. “Otherwise,” he said, “people will criticize that we are simply eating and sleeping and escaping.”\nNityānanda asked whether they should immediately stop using farm machinery.\n“We are not against the machine,” Prabhupāda explained. “You can utilize machine. But we should not allow others to be unemployed while we use the machine. This is the point. You can use the machine, but the first thing is that everyone should be employed. If you have got many men, then why should you engage the machine?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda also explained that in Vedic culture, thekṣatriyascollected taxes and protected the citizens while theśūdrasworked in the fields or at trade. The women would cook, spin, weave, and take care of the milk products. The low-class men, such as cobblers, who used the skin of dead cows, were allowed to eat meat. “But not that one is Professor Such-and-such and yet he is eating meat,” Prabhupāda said. “This is the way of the degraded modern society. Teacher meansbrāhmaṇa,and yet he is eating meat. How horrible! So do these things and organize. I can give you the idea, but I will not live very long. If you can carry it out, you can change the whole world. Especially if you can change America, then the whole world will change.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda became emotional, and tears came to his eyes. “It is the duty!” he said. “Caitanya Mahāprabhu has explainedpara-upakāra:Save them! If it is not possible to save everyone – as many as possible. This is human life. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness – to save those who are in the darkness.\n“Don’t think,” he said, “ ‘Kṛṣṇa consciousness is my profession. I am getting a living, food, and shelter.’ That is just what the Indians are doing. Not like that. It ispara-upakāra.That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then Kṛṣṇa will be very much pleased. Kṛṣṇa personally comes for giving this benefit to the people, and if you do, then how much Kṛṣṇa will be pleased. Just like I am traveling to my centers, and if I see that my students, my men, are doing very nice, everything is going nice, how much pleased I will be. Then I can save my labors and now write books for the rest of my life. Similarly, if Kṛṣṇa sees that you are, on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, trying to save these rascals, then you will very much please Kṛṣṇa. The Vaiṣṇava’s qualification ispara-duḥkha-duḥkhī.He is unhappy seeing others’ distress. This is a Vaiṣṇava.” Śrīla Prabhupāda ended the intimate meeting by rising and leaving the room.\n“One hour?” said Harikeśa, almost in disbelief. “This is amazing!”\nPrabhupāda then took off his shirt and entered the little kitchen of the Mississippi farm. While a crowd of devotees peered in through the open door, Prabhupāda looked at his wristwatch and announced, “It is now twelve o’clock.”\nHe used the same three-tiered brass cooker he had brought to America in 1965. In the bottom section he put mung beans and water, in the middle section he put rice, and in the top he arranged various cut vegetables –  squash, peas, potatoes, and cauliflower. Putting the cooker over a low flame, he then poured an inch ofgheeinto a frying pan and placed it over a flame. Next he cut up an eggplant, dipped the pieces into turmeric and salt, and began to fry them in the hotghee.He mixed and kneaded dough and began rolling outcapātīs.Periodically he checked his wristwatch, and when forty-five minutes had passed, he took the cooker’s top off and turned it upside down to use as a small frying pan. He put ingheeand cooked some bitter melon, then deftly added cumin, anise, chili, and asafoetida. He squeezed lemon on the steamed vegetables and, within a few minutes, had finished.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda looked at his watch. “One hour,” he said. “We have cooked nine preparations.” He then left the kitchen while his servant prepared his plate. Prabhupāda said that everyone who had watched him cook should be given some of theprasādam.\n“How are you using the bulls?” he asked.\nLike a hesitant student, Nityānanda replied, “To plow?”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “to plow and transport. You have to engage more men for plowing. Two bulls may be used for each plow.”\nPassing by a hayfield, Prabhupāda asked why the cut hay still lay in the field. Nityānanda explained that he had to wait for it to dry after the rain. Prabhupāda warned that rain could spoil the hay; it should be harvested soon. Coming upon a three-acre plot of sugarcane, they walked up one row and entered deep into the cane patch, which stood several feet above their heads. Emerging on the other side, they came to the edge of a forest of pine.\n“These jungles are natural arrangement,” said Prabhupāda. “You cut the trees, make your home, and the balance of it you can make for fuel. Then the ground you can plow and grow your own food. That’s all. It’s natural.” Prabhupāda lamented modern society’s waste of trees by printing heaps of useless newspapers. He saw the two acres of fruit trees the devotees had planted – satsumas, peaches, pears, and figs – as well as the twenty-five large pecan trees.\nBut he discovered discrepancies. Nityānanda had lined up for Prabhupāda’s inspection two tractors, a large forage harvester, a hay conditioner, hay mowers, rakes, a blower, and a wagon. But when Prabhupāda saw the machines standing in the open, he asked why they were not being kept under cover. Nityānanda replied that they were still building a shed.\n“In the meantime it will be finished,” said Prabhupāda. “By the time you finish your shed, they will be rusty and gradually become useless.” He quoted a Hindi proverb and translated. “ ‘A woman was dressing to go to a fair, but when she was finally dressed, the fair was already finished.’ ” The devotees laughed, but Nityānanda was grave.\nPrabhupāda continued: “Utilize these machines, otherwise, while they are in working order, sell them. But don’t keep idle in this neglected way.”\nNityānanda showed Prabhupāda where twenty-five acres of sorghum was growing. This grain was for the animals and when harvested would go into the silos.\n“So everything is for the animals?” asked Prabhupāda. “Nothing for man?”\n“The cows give us milk,” explained Nityānanda.\n“That’s all?” asked Prabhupāda. “And you are not growing any food grains? Why?” Prabhupāda’s instruction was clear. Just before the walk was over, he again asked Nityānanda, “What the oxen will do?”\n“Plow the fields,” Nityānanda replied, like a student having learned his lesson.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “that is wanted. Transport and plowing the fields. And unless our men are trained up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they will think, ‘What is the use of taking care of the cow? Better go to the city, earn money, and eat them.’ ”\nThis statement was similar to an instruction Prabhupāda had given in various temples after installing the Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. If the devotees were not enthusiastic, he had warned, the Deity worship would deteriorate into mere ritual, until finally the devotees would resent the spiritual master’s giving them such a burden. Likewise on the farms, if the devotees did not utilize the bulls in the natural way and if they did not use the milk properly, then eventually they would want to get rid of the animals. By conducting things as Prabhupāda had taught, however, the devotees, the cows, and the bulls would live cooperatively and happily and Kṛṣṇa would be pleased.\nAlthough for years Śrīla Prabhupāda had given many practical instructions in other areas of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, this was one of the first times he had given so many practical directions on conductingvarṇāśramasociety. He felt satisfied and pleased to have seen such a promising Kṛṣṇa conscious farm community and, reentering the house, said he was ready to return to New Orleans. It had been a busy, productive day in the service of Kṛṣṇa, and tomorrow would be another.\nDetroitAugust 2, 1975Alfred Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, had become attracted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness through meeting some of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disciples in Detroit and through readingBhagavad-gītā As It Is.He had adopted the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, begun regularly chanting sixteen rounds, and was now Śrīla Prabhupāda’s initiated disciple, Ambarīṣa. Today Ambarīṣa was at the airport, behind the wheel of a white Lincoln Continental limousine, waiting to meet Śrīla Prabhupāda. On seeing Śrīla Prabhupāda approach, Ambarīṣa got out of the driver’s seat and offered obeisances. He opened the back door of the limousine for Śrīla Prabhupāda, shut it, and returned to his seat, just like a menial chauffeur.\n“We devotees also have a car,” said Prabhupāda as they drove away, “but we are going to the temple and distributing books with it. Anything can be used for Kṛṣṇa. Here is a rich man’s son, Alfred Ford. We are giving him a little spiritual teaching, and he is happy.”\nAnother of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Detroit disciples was Elisabeth Reuther, now Lekhaśravantī-devī dāsī, the daughter of labor leader Walter Reuther. Ambarīṣa told Prabhupāda that the Fords and the Reuthers had been enemies, but now two of their descendants were peacefully working together in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrīla Prabhupāda was pleased with the humility of these two disciples, and while he gave them some special status, he did not dote on the fact that they were from such famous families. Ambarīṣa and Lekhaśravantī saw themselves as humble servants of the Vaiṣṇavas.\nOn the way to the temple, Prabhupāda’s car passed a large, modern building displaying flags of many nations and a large sign: “World Headquarters, Ford.” One of the devotees turned to Ambarīṣa and asked, “Is this where you work?”\nFrom the back seat, Prabhupāda spoke up. “No, he is the proprietor.”\nAs they passed by a big urban redevelopment project, Prabhupāda asked, “What is this?”\n“This is known as Detroit’s Renaissance Center,” said Ambarīṣa.\n“They will never have a Renaissance,” Prabhupāda replied.\nBut Prabhupāda was interested. In fact, whatever the devotees cited as bad about the mansion, Prabhupāda would say was actually good, or at least could be easily rectified. As for the high crime rate in the area, he said, “You’ll have nothing to fear. Just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and distributeprasādam.Invite all the neighborhood people, thieves, and rascals, to takeprasādamand chant, and you won’t have any thefts.”\nDevotees emphasized that Detroit was the crime capital of the U.S. and that the poor slum area where the mansion was located was known for drug trafficking, robberies, and murders. But Śrīla Prabhupāda repeated that they should not be afraid. “I lived in the Bowery,” he said, and he described how the bums used to urinate on his front door and lie across the doorway. But when he would come to enter the building, they would get up and say, “Yes, sir. Come on, sir.”\n“Get the place,” Prabhupāda said, “and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa there twenty-four hours a day. If a thief comes, we will say, ‘Yes, first takeprasādam,and then take whatever you want.’ What do we have?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda went to see the mansion with Govardhana, Ambarīṣa, and several G.B.C. men. They were met by the owner and a lady who introduced herself as a real estate agent.\nAs the owner guided them on a tour, Prabhupāda came to like the estate even more. The palatial building was situated on four acres surrounded by a high stone wall. There were gardens and walkways, now in disrepair, as well as fountains and a swimming pool. Some of the devotees thought the place gaudy, with its extravagant 1920s decor, but Śrīla Prabhupāda saw the great potential.\nAs soon as he entered the vestibule and saw the ornate Italian tiles and marble archways, he began to smile. The group entered the lobby, its high ceiling covered with classically sculptured leaves, rosettes, and hand-painted plaster flowers. Next they entered the ballroom, with its marble floor and high, vaulted ceiling painted to resemble an early-evening blue sky with clouds and stars. Special lighting gave the effect of natural starlight. At one end of the hall, three marble arches exactly resembled the design Prabhupāda had given for the Deity altars in his temples. Three altars could be installed there and the ballroom made into a temple with very little renovation. Prabhupāda did not comment to the owner on the ballroom’s suitability, but to the devotees it was obvious.\nThe tour then proceeded to the boat well, an indoor water garage capable of holding several yachts. The boat well opened into a channel, which opened into the nearby Detroit River. Prabhupāda mentioned that the devotees could get a boat for their preaching.\nAs Prabhupāda and his entourage entered one gorgeous room after another, they saw the many carved stone columns, hand-painted floor and wall tiles from Italy and Greece, and ceilings ornamented with gold-leafed figures. Rare antique crystal chandeliers adorned many of the rooms. There were living rooms, library rooms, a dining room, a billiard room, a music room, two master bedrooms, other bedrooms – all extravaganzas. “Each room is worth the entire price,” said Prabhupāda privately to the devotees.\nThe owner spoke of Mayan, Moorish, Spanish, Greek, and Italian influences, and pointed out that the two hand-carved spiral columns in the dining room were salvaged from an ancient European palace. Wherever Śrīla Prabhupāda looked, he saw opulence: an indoor marble fountain, a wall of iridescent tiles, hand-painted cornices. Even the large bathrooms were extraordinary, with glamorous imported tiles and gold-plated accents.\nThe introductory tour completed, Prabhupāda, his followers, the owner, and the real estate agent sat together at an umbrella-covered patio table by the swimming pool. Already Śrīla Prabhupāda had mentioned to his disciples that the owner should donate the building for ISKCON’s missionary purposes, and he had told Brahmānanda Swami to make the request. Since the owner had not mentioned the price, Prabhupāda spoke up.\n“So, we are beggars,” he began. He was serious, and yet he spoke with an air of humor. Ambarīṣa and Upendra hid their faces in embarrassment. “We have no money,” Prabhupāda continued boldly. “Therefore, we are asking you, please give us this building.”\nThe owner glanced incredulously at his real estate agent and then laughed nervously. “It’s out of the question,” he said. “I can’t do that.”\nThe agent was also taken aback and upset. “He can’t do that,” she whispered.\n“I can’t give it to you,” explained the owner, “because I have taken a loss in maintaining this property. So I have to make my money back. This property represents a major part of my income.”\n“Then,” said Prabhupāda, “how much do you want?”\n“Well,” the man replied, “I have to get at least $350,000.”\nNone of the devotees dared say anything. Prabhupāda thought for a moment and then said, “We will give you $300,000 cash.”\n“I’ll have to think about it,” the man replied.\nThe real estate agent got to her feet, saying that a transaction like this is usually not done straight to the owner. But Prabhupāda ignored her and spoke with the owner about how lovely the mansion was. Prabhupāda then got up and took a short walk in the garden with his men.\nGovardhana asked Prabhupāda if he’d liked it, and Prabhupāda said, “Yes, who would not like such a building?”\n“Ambarīṣa doesn’t like it,” said Govardhana.\n“Oh?”\nAmbarīṣa said he thought the mansion wasmāyā.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “butmāyāis also Kṛṣṇa. We can use anything in Kṛṣṇa’s service.”\nLeaving the garden path and returning to their cars, Prabhupāda asked Ambarīṣa, “So, is this possible?”\n“Yes, Prabhupāda. This is possible.”\nAs soon as they returned to the temple, Ambarīṣa and Lekhaśravantī conferred. Her inheritance was limited, but she was able to give $125,000. Ambarīṣa had to come up with the balance.\nThe next day the owner came to see Śrīla Prabhupāda. The man was accompanied by two women, and they all appeared a little intoxicated. He had come to say that he accepted the offer. Prabhupāda smiled and reaffirmed his intention to buy.\nAfterward, Śrīla Prabhupāda openly showed his blissfulness about the purchase. “Just see,” he said, “I didn’t have one penny, and yet I offered him $300,000 cash. And now Kṛṣṇa has provided the money.”\nAs Prabhupāda had told the estate owner, “I am asannyāsī.I have no money.” And after collecting $300,000 from his disciples, he still had no money. Within a few days he left for Toronto, taking nothing for himself. Everything was Kṛṣṇa’s, to be used in Kṛṣṇa’s service.\nTorontoAugust 7, 1975Despite a severe toothache and swollen jaw, Śrīla Prabhupāda continued with lectures, interviews, and his usual activities. He could not chew and took only puréed fruit. When asked if he would see a dentist, he told the devotees not to worry; he was used to difficulties.\nThe Toronto temple was a small, run-down building, and Prabhupāda was interested in helping the devotees relocate. All the real estate brokers they had approached had told them about a fabulous church for sale downtown. The temple president, Viśvakarmā, had looked at the building, but the owners were asking almost half a million dollars, with a large down payment. When Prabhupāda went to see the church, he decided that somehow they must get it. If necessary he could send the total BBT collections for two months as a loan to the Toronto temple. Prabhupāda told them to offer $300,000 cash, but when Uttamaśloka went, the church directors rejected the offer, saying they had already rejected an offer for much more.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda did not give up the idea of getting the church, however, and he mentioned it before a meeting of Indians. Near the end of the program, when the host begged Prabhupāda to return again to bless them, Prabhupāda took the opportunity to request all present to please help the devotees raise money to purchase the church. Once they had actually purchased it, he said, he would return to Toronto. Many of the gentlemen present promised to help.\nSuddenly, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s North American tour was interrupted. A telegram from Tejās in New Delhi announced that if Prabhupāda wanted an interview with Indira Gandhi, he would have to come at once. The telegram contained no details, and his secretary was unable to reach the Delhi temple by phone. But Prabhupāda didn’t need to hear anything more. When an auspicious opportunity arose, he said, a devotee should act at once.\nHarikeśa planned the trip so they could stop in Montreal overnight. From Montreal they would fly to Paris, where Prabhupāda could rest before going on to Delhi. As word of Prabhupāda’s imminent departure spread, several devotees in Toronto tried to see Prabhupāda for last instructions about their projects. Rāmeśvara also phoned from Los Angeles, pressing Harikeśa to ask Prabhupāda a list of last-minute editorial questions regarding the Fifth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.The questions, however, concerning theBhāgavatam’sexplanation of the structure of the universe, Prabhupāda rejected as unintelligent. He ordered the BBT to simply print the books as they were.\nNot only was the prospect of meeting with Prime Minister Gandhi prompting Prabhupāda’s return to India, but so were his uncompleted projects, especially Hare Krishna Land in Bombay. Brahmānanda Swami said he thought Prabhupāda had been looking for such a chance to end his Western tour and get back into personally managing the projects in India. Prabhupāda had just dictated a letter to Surabhi in Vṛndāvana, expressing disappointment that things could not get done without him.\nDevotees in Boston, New Vrindaban, and New York received the news of Prabhupāda’s sudden departure with shock – he would not be visiting their temples! And they felt the impact of the stark realization that Śrīla Prabhupāda could leave them at any moment. He was not obliged to stay with them, and they should not take his presence for granted. They had his instructions; this was sufficient. Of course, important decisions still had to be made. In Boston the devotees had expected Prabhupāda to look at a new building with them; but based on his instruction, they could become responsible and carry out his will, even in his absence.\nThe devotees who had recently received Prabhupāda in their temples realized how valuable had been those moments. The personal association they had had should be relished, remembered, and acted upon. The book distributors already knew that their work was most important to Prabhupāda, and that was sufficient. The Press workers in Los Angeles weren’t dependent on Prabhupāda’s staying in America; they had their mission – seventeen books in two months – and they were working day and night.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s traveling in the U.S. and Canada had been exactly in the mood of a wanderingsannyāsī.And he was showing his G.B.C. men that they should not simply sit behind desks and manage but should travel and preach. Traveling, Prabhupāda stressed, did not mean aimless wandering or pleasure-seeking. While traveling, the preacher had to do some substantial work for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness society. And that also Śrīla Prabhupāda had shown – at the Dallas Gurukula, the Mississippi farm, Ratha-yātrā. In Detroit he had secured a mansion, and in Toronto he was praying for a wonderful church, to be financed by the Indians. In Chicago he had shown how to preach on contemporary issues like crime and women’s liberation – without compromise. His disciples could not match or imitate him, but his example of selfless work on behalf of Kṛṣṇa should be their standard.\nIn spite of Prabhupāda’s traveling to so many cities, most people in the United States did not recognize his position. Reporters would interview him, but their superficial stories in the newspapers drew little attention. To the press, Prabhupāda was just another celebrity in the constant parade of faces and events. As Lord Kṛṣṇa had predicted inBhagavad-gītā,out of thousands of men, only one seeks perfection. Śrīla Prabhupāda, in his tireless search for that one person out of thousands, had shown his enthusiasm and willingness to speak with whoever came to see him. And through Ratha-yātrā and other public festivals, he was offering millions a first taste of potent spiritual life. Even one moment’s association with a pure devotee could save them from a most inauspicious fate in their next life.\nBesides the hundreds of thousands who benefited incidentally, in each city a fortunate few felt their lives greatly affected by Śrīla Prabhupāda. Professor Thomas Hopkins in Philadelphia, Assemblyman John Porter in Chicago, a flight supervisor on the plane to San Francisco, an appreciative mother in Philadelphia, and many others – all understood that their meeting with Śrīla Prabhupāda was special.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda often cited a specific reason for his touring. “My duty,” he had said in Berkeley, “is to see that my disciples, who have accepted me asguru,may not fall down. That is my anxiety.” And as he had lovingly expressed it in Dallas, “I have got so many children and grandchildren, so I have come to see them.” He was the spiritual father of his disciples, and every ISKCON center was his home.\nWhile touring his movement in the West, Śrīla Prabhupāda had felt satisfied that it was growing stronger. Opposition was also growing, but he took that as another sign of ISKCON’s authenticity. His original plan was still intact, and on this tour he had been pursuing it. America had a chance of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious – at least he and his disciples should try for that. If they succeeded, then the whole world could be uplifted by that transcendental influence.\nPrabhupāda liked preaching in America. “Mostly my students are American,” he had said, “and they help me very kindly push on this movement.” But one man in the San Diego crowd had shouted back that he wanted more sex than was allowed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So Prabhupāda’s estimation was that Americans had good hearts, but that for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness they were becoming completely confused, frustrated, and degraded.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had come first to America in 1965 to plant the seed of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That he had done. Now, with dozens of centers across the country and many others around the world, he was realizing that his ambitions were not going unfulfilled. He also accepted that to make Kṛṣṇa consciousness the dominant force in America and the world was something he might not see in his lifetime. “It is not one man’s work,” he had said, and he asked everyone – Americans, Indians, and all world citizens – to take part in distributing Lord Caitanya’s mercy.\nOnly a rare few came forward to help him, however, and he worked with them. Touring, therefore, was but another attempt at making his organization as strong as possible while it was within his power to do so. Actually, he was living for others, and he didn’t think he would live much longer. He wanted to continue touring, building ISKCON, saving as many lost souls as possible. And he wanted to impress upon his sincere followers and upon others who would read his books that every human being should take up this same work and live for the benefit of others by distributing Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

        "content": "THERE WERE, OF COURSE, other reasons for Prabhupāda’s returning to India besides meeting Indira Gandhi. His regular rhythm had become to alternate touring the West with staying in India. He was leading his movement by traveling from center to center, but for at least five years now he had devoted more of his time to India.\nHis ambitious projects in Māyāpur and Vṛndāvana, although increasing the prestige of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, were by no means completed. And Hare Krishna Land in Bombay was still only a construction site. Unlike in America and Europe, where Śrīla Prabhupāda achieved his objectives by inspiring disciples to carry on the management, in Indiahewas the manager. He had to be; otherwise his Western disciples would be cheated and become dispirited. Pressing managerial decisions, therefore, brought him frequently to India.\nMoreover, he had a special inclination to be in India. He had a deep spiritual attraction to the holydhāmas –Vṛndāvana was his home and Māyāpur was his place of worship – and he liked the unique opportunities for meeting and influencing people in places like Bombay. His upcoming meeting with India’s chief executive was the kind of opportunity that came rarely in the West.\nAnd in addition to all these reasons Prabhupāda also felt most relaxed and at home there. When breaking some of his commitments to visit more cities in the U.S., he had written to a disciple, “I was not able to come to Atlanta because I was called here to India on urgent business. Also I was feeling inconvenienced by so much traveling.” Prabhupāda often referred to New York, London, and Los Angeles as his special homes and to America as his fatherland. And when a disciple had once remarked that Prabhupāda would feel more at home in India, he had replied, “My only home is the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.” Nevertheless, for whatever reason or combination of reasons, Śrīla Prabhupāda was showing a definite preference for staying in India.\nSurabhi and Mūrti showed him drawings for other temples. An interested person in Nelore, near Hyderabad, was speaking of donating land, and the devotees had drawn up plans for a temple complex, complete with library and dormitories. Prabhupāda approved the plans. The temple buildings, he said, should be traditional, according to the śāstric directions, but the other buildings could incorporate more modern designs. He also studied and approved plans for temples in Hyderabad and Fiji.\nEarly the next morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda called for Surabhi and Mūrti and again went over their various plans with detailed interest. He had little time left before his meeting with the prime minister, however, and the next day he left for Delhi.\nNew DelhiAugust 22, 1975At 9:15 in the morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda and several of his leading disciples arrived at the prime minister’s home, where they were confronted by a formidable security check. Two days before, the prime minister of Bangladesh had been assassinated, and Mrs. Gandhi was rumored to be next. Armed soldiers, therefore, surrounded her residence. The guards at the outer gate decided that the foreigners could not go in; Śrīla Prabhupāda alone could enter. While one guard opened the gate, another ushered Śrīla Prabhupāda into a car, which carried him to the prime minister’s front door.\nMeanwhile, the devotees waited in anxiety by the outer gate. Always some disciples would accompany Prabhupāda wherever he went; his disciples worried, almost like doting parents, that he might need their assistance.\nIn tiny, cramped handwriting, Śrīla Prabhupāda had noted down in a small address book a list of points he wanted to discuss with Mrs. Gandhi.\nThe most pressing item was at the head of the list: Mrs. Gandhi should grant permanent visas to Prabhupāda’s Western disciples in India. Just a few weeks before, some of the foreign devotees in Māyāpur had been asked to leave the country. For years Prabhupāda had been asking for permanent visas whenever he met governors, members of Parliament, or other men of influence. Devotees were constantly being asked to leave the country to renew their six-month visas. The travel costs incurred and the disruption of the devotees’ services seriously hampered ISKCON’s work in India; therefore, Prabhupāda wanted Indira Gandhi to sanction up to five hundred foreign disciples to stay permanently in India.\nThe other points on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s list were scriptural directions for how the prime minister could make her leadership Kṛṣṇa conscious, in the spirit of the greatrājarṣisof the Vedic age. These were the same tenets of God conscious leadership he preached wherever he went, and he had deep conviction that if the world’s leaders would apply them, an era of peace, prosperity, and happiness would dawn. Indira Gandhi had a tendency toward authoritative control, so she should exercise it in terms of Vedic directions. Then her rule could become most effective and beneficial.\nA government official opened the door to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s car, ushered him into the house, and brought him before the prime minister. As Prabhupāda entered the room, Mrs. Gandhi stood up. Although she greeted him cordially and offered him a seat, he could immediately detect that she was distracted, fearful for her life. She openly admitted it, and added that this was not, therefore, a good time for their meeting. Prabhupāda felt that she would have preferred not to meet at all, but was allowing it only because she had promised. Her agreeing to see him, he felt, was an indication that she had some attraction for spiritual life, but he understood that on this visit at least, he could not introduce the extensive advice he had been contemplating.\nMrs. Gandhi complimented Śrīla Prabhupāda on the work he was doing all over the world. “They are good boys,” he replied, and he asked if she could arrange for permanent visas. She agreed, but again mentioned her present anxiety. They soon ended their talk, and Śrīla Prabhupāda left.\nAfter promising delivery of books by October at the latest, the letter was signed by about sixty devotees: “Your unworthy servants at ISKCON Press.” On their behalf, Rāmeśvara stated,\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wrote back the next day from Delhi.\nOn August 21 Rāmeśvara sent Śrīla Prabhupāda a telegram.\nAlthough Śrīla Prabhupāda traveled on to Vṛndāvana, the devotees were able to dispatch advance copies of all fifteen volumes to him by his eightieth birthday on August 31. Just after Prabhupāda observed the ceremony in the temple, a devotee arrived in Vṛndāvana with the final six volumes of theCaitanya-caritāmṛta.\nWith great relish and satisfaction Śrīla Prabhupāda examined the books. He was pleased with the artwork and quickly became absorbed in reading the pastimes of Lord Caitanya. He felt so inspired, he remarked to the devotees in Vṛndāvana, that he was thinking of stopping all touring and just staying in Vṛndāvana and translating. The reciprocation of the devotees at ISKCON Press was so sincere that it increased Śrīla Prabhupāda’s desire to reciprocate with them. He wrote to “My dear Rāmeśvara and company,”\nImmediately Prabhupāda found discrepancies. In the guesthouse, which was for guests, not disciples, he found married disciples living with their children. This was not proper, he said, and these families would have to find other quarters nearby or leave Vṛndāvana. He also found problems with the plumbing, the municipal sewage system, the financial management, the Deity worship, the cleanliness, and the devotees’ behavior.\nAlmost every area of temple life and every devotee required special attention. In the smallest discrepancies, Prabhupāda would sometimes see the essence of all problems, and he would instantly point it out. And because his disciples took his words with utmost seriousness, as coming directly from Kṛṣṇa, his reprimands were often devastating.\nPrabhupāda was a difficult taskmaster. A Vaiṣṇava is said to be “as soft as a rose and as hard as a thunderbolt,” but Prabhupāda began showing more the thunderbolt side of his personality. Sometimes a neophyte’s conception of the spiritual master is that he must always be peaceful and pleased with everything that happens, and that this is a sign of his being situated in transcendental consciousness. Śrīla Prabhupāda, however, demonstrated many moods – including anger.\nIn its material form, anger (krodha) is described inBhagavad-gītāas occurring when one’s lust (kāma)cannot be fully satisfied. A truesādhu,therefore, because he does not have lusty desires, does not become possessed by anger.\nThe Vaiṣṇava poet Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, however, declares that anger may also be used in serving Kṛṣṇa. Narottama dāsa gives the example of Hanumān, the eternal servant of Lord Rāma, who displayed his great anger in fighting against Rāvaṇa and the other demoniac enemies of the Lord. Rūpa Gosvāmī also wrote in theBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhuthat a devotee should not tolerate blasphemy to Kṛṣṇa or to the Vaiṣṇavas and that his response might justifiably be transcendental anger. Even Lord Kṛṣṇa incited the anger of the nonviolent Arjuna, inducing him to fight. And that fighting was transcendental, whereas Arjuna’s reluctance to fight was material.\nAmong sentimentalists and impersonalists, however, the image persists that asādhushould never show anger. When, at a largepaṇḍālfestival in Delhi, Śrīla Prabhupāda had shown anger toward a man who spoke against Kṛṣṇa, many in the audience had misunderstood; some had even walked out.\nPrabhupāda’s disciples could accept his anger. They even welcomed it – theoretically. But to bear it was difficult. The spiritual master must cut through his student’s false ego to engage that student in pure service. Theguru’sshow of anger, therefore, is good for the disciple. According to Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, one should not be lenient with sons and disciples. Unless he deals strictly with them, he will spoil them.\nPrabhupāda’s anger in Vṛndāvana was not, however, a mere exercise in student training. He strongly desired to see the temple solidly established. He trusted that his disciples were sufficiently loyal to him to withstand the pain of chastisement and take it for what it was: mercy.\nPrabhupāda was vigilant about the devotees’ attendance at the morning devotional program in the temple. Calling for the temple president, he asked why some devotees were regularly absent.Maṅgala-ārati,he said, was very important, and everyone must attend. Punctuality was also important. The exact time for themaṅgala-āratiwould vary according to the clock, he said, but it must always be one-and-a-half hours before sunrise.\nPrabhupāda would take his morning walk, timing it so he would be back in the temple a few moments before the Deity doors were supposed to open fordarśana.Once when he was waiting, with all the devotees gathered around, he looked at his watch and then asked Akṣayānanda Swami, “What is the time?” Aware that Śrīla Prabhupāda was speaking with exactitude, Akṣayānanda replied that it was thirty seconds after seven-thirty. Prabhupāda shook his head, and with a resigned look he said, “It is very difficult to be abrāhmaṇa –thirty seconds late. Why are they taking so long to dress the Deity?”\nAkṣayānanda explained that the Deity dressing took about one-and-a-half hours.\n“They are simply lazy,” Prabhupāda replied.\n“How long should it take, Śrīla Prabhupāda?”\n“Half an hour at most.”\nAkṣayānanda was flabbergasted, since he knew of nopūjārīwho could come even close to that. He remained silent.\n“What is the difficulty?” Prabhupāda challenged. “Half an hour at most.”\nShortly after Prabhupāda had arrived, he had noticed that the path leading to the front gate was not clean. He had complained strongly, “Why this is not clean? It should be cleaned by the time daybreak comes. I want to see this cleaned.” The temple commander, a young Englishman from Australia named Hari-śauri, was supposed to supervise all the cleaning, but he had taken much of it for himself. After hearing Prabhupāda’s remarks about the pathway, Hari-śauri had resolved to rectify the problem. Immediately aftermaṅgala-āratihe would run out to the front of the temple, throw water on the stone pathways, and madly run the large squeegee over the front steps and walkway, so that by the time Prabhupāda came by, most of the area would be sparkling clean. And by the time he would return from his walk, all the outdoor walkways would be clean. Śrīla Prabhupāda didn’t say anything further about the walkway, which seemed to be a positive sign.\nGetting the devotees to ring the bell in the temple dome on time was a major effort for Śrīla Prabhupāda, as was getting them to ring the bell in the temple hall at all. His desire was that the bell in the temple dome should sound the hour and ring once every half hour. The grounds watchman, orchaukīdār,was supposed to do it, and Guṇārṇava was to see that he did. But for weeks there were problems, especially during the hours of the night, when thechaukīdārtended to fall asleep.\nFor Śrīla Prabhupāda, the undependable bell ringing revealed much about the overall temple management in Vṛndāvana. He made it clear: “I am judging the management of this temple by the ringing of the bell.” If the nightwatchman was sleeping, and if the temple leaders could not execute a simple order, how would the temple and guesthouse, with all their complexities, operate smoothly? Akṣayānanda Swami and Guṇārṇava sometimes thought that they would never solve the problem of the bells, especially since they already had so many other things to do.\nBut Śrīla Prabhupāda was relentless. Whenever the bell missed by even a few minutes he would demand to know what was wrong. During the night he was usually the only one not sleeping, but he would wake Akṣayānanda or others and reprimand them if the bell failed. One night at midnight he woke Harikeśa, his traveling secretary.\n“Do you hear that?” demanded Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nHarikeśa strained to hear. “I don’t hear anything.”\n“You can’t hear it?” repeated Prabhupāda.\n“I’m sorry, but I can’t hear anything.”\n“That’s right! Go out there and wake up thechaukīdār,and make him ring the bell!”\nHarikeśa went out into the darkness, woke the sleepingchaukīdār,got him to ring the bell, and then returned to sleep. And so did thechaukīdār.\nAt 12:30 Prabhupāda again rang.\n“Did you hear it again?”\n“No, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Harikeśa.\n“So go out and wake him again!”\nIn addition to getting the temple dome bell to ring on time, getting both the bells to operate properly was also a problem. The bells were of heavy brass, worked by a rope. Prabhupāda wanted the bell in the temple to be rung constantly during theārati kīrtanas.It took weeks for Guṇārṇava to arrange it.\nAnd the bell in the temple dome was particularly difficult, since the rope rubbed on the stone walls and soon snapped. The thicker rope Guṇārṇava got simply spoiled the clarity of the chime and made the ringing uneven, which Prabhupāda immediately noticed. Guṇārṇava tried a chain – too heavy. A nylon rope – it broke. Materials were scarce in Vṛndāvana, and each change meant another delay, sometimes days. Nothing seemed to make the bell work properly.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda told Guṇārṇava to try a pulley. Somehow Guṇārṇava couldn’t surrender to that particular instruction. He thought the rope would just jump the track. One of the devotees did purchase a pulley, but Guṇārṇava said it was useless.\nWhen Prabhupāda called Guṇārṇava to his room and demanded, “Where are the pulley wheels?” Guṇārṇava said he had sent them back. “You rascal!” Prabhupāda shouted. “I am asking for pulleys, and you are sending them back!”\nGuṇārṇava apologized, ran out, and got a pulley. It didn’t work. Then he got the idea of designing a bracket with a hole in it. The next morning Prabhupāda came out of his room and walked around to the front of the temple to check on the bell. For Guṇārṇava and others the whole affair was becoming unbearable.\n“Let us hear the bell,” said Prabhupāda.\nGiving mighty tugs to the rope, a devotee rang the bell again and again.\n“No, that’s wrong,” said Prabhupāda.\nGuṇārṇava showed Prabhupāda the wooden bracket arrangement, and Prabhupāda thought it was a good idea. Guṇārṇava even tried to improve it by greasing the hole, and it worked for a while. But then the rope snapped again.\nOne morning Guṇārṇava invited Prabhupāda to see the new book display. In a sincere effort to please Prabhupāda, the devotees had set up a book display just inside the entrance to the temple. There were bookshelves with built-in lighting, a display case, and a counter for sales.\nShowing off the book display was a triumph for the temple managers. The lights worked, and Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books were neatly placed. The G.B.C. secretary for Vṛndāvana, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, was also present, telling Śrīla Prabhupāda that actually the temple was first class and that things were now going smoothly. As Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, Akṣayānanda Swami, Guṇārṇava, and others pointed out the features of the book display, Śrīla Prabhupāda was silent, then suddenly agitated.\n“You say that everything is first class,” he said, “but I see that it is fifth class! Just see!” He banged his cane on the floor and then lifted it up, pointing. “I have come six thousand miles to tell you about a bird’s nest.” The assembled devotees all looked up to behold a large bird’s nest within the chandelier. Birds were nesting there, amid the protruding straw. Yet until now, no one had noticed the dirty, unsightly presence.\nOne day Śrīla Prabhupāda was meeting with the temple managers. He wanted practical ideas, not sentiments. He complained about overspending, in Vṛndāvana and now in Bombay also, where construction was just beginning. “You will squander money here,” he said, “and Surabhi will squander money there. What is your plan to stop this? What will you do?” No one knew what to say. There was a long silence.\nFinally Akṣayānanda spoke up. “We will become Kṛṣṇa conscious.”\n“An impractical suggestion!” Prabhupāda exclaimed.\nAkṣayānanda Swami regularly expected the thunderbolt, but that didn’t keep him from wanting to be with Śrīla Prabhupāda. On one morning walk Prabhupāda mentioned how the climate in Vṛndāvana was very harsh, both in summer and in winter. In winter, he said, the cold would sometimes be accompanied by rain.\n“But Prabhupāda,” said Akṣayānanda, “even if it rains stool and urine and pus and blood from the sky, still we should stay in Vṛndāvana?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda gave an almost impish smile and said, “Oh, you are expecting?” The devotees burst out laughing.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, and he kept walking. After a while he added, “But don’t try for passing stool once a day.”\n“Acchā,”responded Akṣayānanda.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda smiled. “Do you think if you pass stool once a day that you are ayogī?”\n“How inauspicious,” Hari-śauri thought. “The first time my spiritual master has ever called for me, and it’s over a bad incident like this.”\nPrabhupāda did not immediately reprimand him, but first asked for his version of what had happened. Hari-śauri appreciated the opportunity, and he began to tell the whole story. When he mentioned that the old man had asked to speak with an authority and that he had told him he was the temple commander, Śrīla Prabhupāda interrupted. “Hmmm.” Prabhupāda gave his disciple a penetrating glance. “Temple commander does not mean commander-in-chief. Where have you heard this, about eatingprasādamin front of the Deity?”\nHari-śauri could not remember an exact reference, and he became embarrassed. “Well, I thought I read it in one of your books, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said.\n“Hmmm.” Prabhupāda looked at him again. He could understand his disciple’s ignorant mistake. Because of the boy’s inexperience in India, he had not understood the serious implications of what he had done. Actually, because of the sensitive relationship between ISKCON devotees and the residents of Vṛndāvana, he should have tolerated the abuse. His was an ignorant mistake, but ignorance was no excuse.\n“This is a great offense,” said Prabhupāda. “He will go out and tell so many people that the foreigners have thrown him out. This is very bad.”\nPrabhupāda looked gravely at Hari-śauri. “Now you find out where this man is staying,” he said, “and you bring him back here. Invite him to come back.”\nHari-śauri tried his best, looking all day for the young Bengali man, who was reportedly staying at a hotel in Mathurā. He was unsuccessful, however. Disappointed, he returned to the temple, and as soon as he returned, a devotee came and told him Prabhupāda wanted to see him. “Oh, no,” he thought. “Now Prabhupāda will really be angry.”\nHari-śauri entered Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, which was filled with guests.\n“This boy has come,” said Prabhupāda, and as Hari-śauri looked around he saw the young Bengali man. The man smiled and said, “Hare Kṛṣṇa.” They embraced and began to make apologies.\n“So you give him this fruit,” said Prabhupāda to Hari-śauri, indicating a basket of fruit sitting on the floor. He then dismissed them and continued preaching to the others in the room. The disagreement was settled, but it had been Prabhupāda himself who had changed the young man’s heart and rectified a volatile incident.\n“Oh, she must do everything?” Prabhupāda replied. It was far from being as heavy as some of his criticisms of the temple managers, but Daivī-śakti took it as an indication that she should become much more attentive to the details of her service.\nKiśorī would also bring a garland for Śrīla Prabhupāda in the afternoon. To make it cooling, she would sprinkle it with water. For two days Prabhupāda said nothing, but on the third day he remarked, “Take this away. Why do you put water like that? It is very displeasing.”\nViśāla had a practice, which other devotees considered eccentric, of standing at the gate and loudly reciting Sanskrit verses as Śrīla Prabhupāda passed. One morning Prabhupāda approached the gate in a thunderbolt mood, and as usual Viśāla came forward reciting verses.\n“Why don’t you do something useful?” Prabhupāda said. “Sweep this water away.”\nAnd so it was with each department. Even when riding in the car, Prabhupāda would ask, “You are having it oiled regularly? You are having it lubricated and serviced?”\nConstant travel, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, was becoming more and more inconvenient – one reason for his return to India. But he was by no means stopping; unless he traveled, his movement could not remain vital and healthy. So he was prepared, despite inconvenience, to continue touring. Disciples never stopped inviting him to travel, and recently Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Swami had asked him to come to South Africa. When Prabhupāda agreed, Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa had quickly arranged ten festivals and other engagements in Durban and Johannesburg, covering a period of three weeks in October.\nDevotees on the predominantly Hindu island of Mauritius had also requested Prabhupāda to visit, mentioning that the prime minister wanted to meet him. Prabhupāda agreed. Leaving Vṛndāvana – making brief stops in Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Bombay – he was off to Africa.\nMauritiusOctober 1, 1975Relieved of management, Prabhupāda was freer now to lecture to interested gatherings. Reception by the press and government ministers in Mauritius was good, but most public questions reflected a lack of sincere interest in spiritual knowledge: “Is it necessary to be a vegetarian?” “Is the soul locked in the third eye?” “You seem dogmatic. Is there any doubt in your philosophy?” Nevertheless, people were respectful and considered Śrīla Prabhupāda an important leader and spiritual authority. He remained there a week.\nDurbanOctober 5This was Prabhupāda’s first visit to South Africa. For two years the devotees there had been trying to get him a visa, but the government was wary of foreign missionaries. The bureaucratic delays, therefore, had taken months. The devotees had even had to send copies of Prabhupāda’s books for the government officials to review.\nEvery night for a week, Śrīla Prabhupāda delivered public lectures to crowds of at least a thousand – mostly Hindus, but also many whites. After Prabhupāda’s lecture at the University of Durban, Westville, a member of the faculty tried to discredit the lecture by stating, “Well, this is just the Hindu concept.” Repeatedly Śrīla Prabhupāda tried explaining how the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness were universal and scientific, but the man kept replying that it was Hindu culture. Dr. S. P. Olivier, rector of the university, sympathized with Prabhupāda’s presentation and stayed afterward to speak at length with him. “I think you are quite right,” Dr. Olivier began, “but very few people tonight got the point you were trying to make, that this is a scientific reality.”\nJohannesburgOctober 12Śrīla Prabhupāda’s arrival at the Johannesburg airport was culturally extraordinary for South Africa – white men bowing down before an Indian! The devotees had borrowed a yellow Mercedes-Benz and had parked it in a spot reserved for state ministers and other dignitaries. No one objected. As Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived, devotees threw flower petals, some young European onlookers bowed down, and the police – impressed by all the protocol – saluted Śrīla Prabhupāda and respectfully opened the door to his Mercedes.\nAs in Durban, Prabhupāda’s lectures were well attended. He was keen to have his books sold during these programs, and he would go to the book booths and ask his disciples, “Are they buying the books?” He was concerned that the Europeans, not just the Hindus, buy the books.\nPrabhupāda spoke strongly against racial discrimination, but unlike Mahatma Gandhi, who had been imprisoned in South Africa for his outspoken views, Prabhupāda spoke on the authority of scripture. “What is this black-white business?” he said. “It is nonsense. It is the bodily concept of life.” In South Africa such statements would ordinarily have been considered volatile politics, yet everyone appreciated Śrīla Prabhupāda, because he spoke on a purely spiritual level.\nOne of Prabhupāda’s disciples in South Africa, Ṛddha, asked privately how to deal with the racial issue in Johannesburg. The only solution, Prabhupāda said, was masshari-nāma saṅkīrtana.When Ṛddha asked about starting a farm community, Prabhupāda replied, “Don’t be so eager to move out to the country. The preaching is in the cities.” He said he was very pleased with what his disciples had done in South Africa within such a short time.\nWhile Prabhupāda was in Johannesburg, Rāmeśvara and company fulfilled their promise and reached him with copies of both volumes of the Fifth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Śrīla Prabhupāda took the books with him to his lecture at one university and quoted from them, speaking on Lord Ṛṣabhadeva’s instructions, beginning with the verse in which Ṛṣabhadeva advises His sons not to live for sense gratification.\nMauritiusOctober 24Prabhupāda had returned to meet with the prime minister. As a friendly gesture, the prime minister had sent a chauffeured car for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s use in Mauritius. One day Prabhupāda was leaving to take a ride in the countryside, but as he was about to enter the car on the right side, Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Swami suggested, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, come to the other side. It’s safer.” And Prabhupāda complied. For half an hour they rode through the beautiful countryside, past sugarcane fields, mountains, and the ocean. At one point, they stopped and walked along a cliff beside the sea. When they returned to the car, Brahmānanda Swami opened the right-side door and Prabhupāda said, “No, the other side is safer,” just as Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa had previously suggested.\nA few minutes later, as Prabhupāda’s black Citroen was rounding a curve, a Volkswagen suddenly appeared, heading toward them in the same lane. Prabhupāda was seated behind Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa, and Brahmānanda was seated behind the driver. The moment before the Volkswagen had appeared, Śrīla Prabhupāda had sat up, cross-legged, planting his cane against the floor of the car to support himself.\nAs the Volkswagen rushed toward them, the chauffeur braked, swerving to the left, but the Volkswagen swerved in the same direction. There was a head-on collision. Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa’s head hit the windshield, cracking the glass. The driver’s head also slammed against the glass, and his face was covered with blood.\nIn the back seat, Śrīla Prabhupāda remained sitting, his face set gravely. Brahmānanda, in shock, suddenly embraced Prabhupāda, as if to protect him, although the danger had already passed.\nBrahmānanda then jumped out of the car to try and flag down a motorist, and Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa got out and opened the back door, where he found Śrīla Prabhupāda with his face bruised, his leg bleeding, and pieces of glass scattered at his feet. Prabhupāda didn’t speak or indicate how he felt. Suddenly Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa realized that the car, disabled on a curve, was in a dangerous position, so he joined Brahmānanda in the road to caution motorists and to try to get someone to stop.\nThe Citroen and the Volkswagen were totaled, and the man and woman in the Volkswagen were both injured. Motorists soon stopped, and when the injured persons had received help, Prabhupāda and the devotees got into a car and rode back to the temple.\nHarikeśa was waiting anxiously, wondering why Śrīla Prabhupāda was so late, when suddenly Prabhupāda entered, walking very stiffly, saying nothing. When Harikeśa saw all three were injured, he cried out, “My God! What happened? What happened?” But Śrīla Prabhupāda just walked to his quarters and sat down, silent. A devotee brought bandages for the obvious injuries: Prabhupāda’s chin, hand, and leg, and Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa’s and Brahmānanda’s heads.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had said nothing since the accident. Finally he spoke: “Asann api kleśa-da āsa dehaḥ.”And he translated: “As soon as you accept this material body, there are so many difficulties. We were sitting peacefully in the car, and the next moment – crash.” He talked briefly about the collision, and Brahmānanda Swami told how just before the accident Prabhupāda had braced himself with his cane, preventing perhaps more serious injuries.\n“Get some resin and turmeric,” Prabhupāda said. “Mix it together with a bit of lye, and heat it.” Prabhupāda was again speaking –Bhāgavataphilosophy and practical medical remedies. It remained a frightening event, however, and Prabhupāda asked the devotees to havekīrtana.Kṛṣṇa had saved them, he said. Considering that both cars had been destroyed, the injuries were negligible.\nPrabhupāda sat like a battle hero, anointed in three places with the yellow poultice, while Harikeśa read aloud fromCaitanya-caritāmṛta –“The Disappearance of Haridāsa Ṭhākura.”\nThen Śrīla Prabhupāda began talking about the dangers of traveling, questioning the advisability of his extensive touring. His mission of translatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamand other Vaiṣṇava literature was too important for him to be risking his life traveling in automobiles. He had been considering a visit to Nairobi before returning to Bombay, but now he said he would cancel his visit. He said he had never wanted to leave Bombay, but because they had made so many arrangements in Africa, he had come. Perhaps the accident was a sign that he should go back to India.\nThe next morning, with Brahmānanda Swami and Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Swami hobbling along, Prabhupāda went on his morning walk as usual, although he favored his injured knee. Again he discussed with his disciples whether he should go on to Nairobi or return to India. Cyavana, the president of ISKCON Nairobi, argued that Prabhupāda should go to Nairobi. The devotees there were expecting it, he said, and they had made arrangements. If Prabhupāda canceled now, he would probably not come back for a long time. Others, however, argued that there was no question of asking Śrīla Prabhupāda to keep going now, after this traumatic accident; he should go directly to Bombay.\nPrabhupāda heard both opinions, but he was more affected by the consideration of disappointing the devotees in Nairobi than of recuperating after the accident. He decided to go to Nairobi.\nBut after only a few days in Nairobi, Prabhupāda became anxious to return to India. Reports were reaching him about mismanagement in Bombay and about building materials being stolen from the property through a conspiracy involving the workers, the storekeeper, and thechaukīdārs.When Śrīla Prabhupāda heard this, he became so morose he stopped translating. He even stopped eating. Although thousands of miles from Bombay, he was feeling the pain more than any of the devotees there. Many of them, in fact, were not even aware that the theft was taking place. When Brahmānanda Swami asked Prabhupāda why he wasn’t eating, he replied, “How can I eat when my money is being stolen?”\nBombayNovember 1Śrīla Prabhupāda’s plane from Nairobi arrived in Bombay at one A.M., yet even at such an early hour he was greeted at the temple by a gathering of intimate life members, disciples, and even some of the tenants on the land. When the group followed him to his room, he confided that he had had a serious accident, and he even showed them the scar on his knee. He said he was relieved to be back. In a letter from Bombay he wrote,\nISKCON Bombay was Śrīla Prabhupāda’s office, and he immediately got to work. He fired the engineer, whom he held responsible for the poor, slow work and stolen building materials. At first Prabhupāda had tried to avoid hiring a construction company by having Surabhi oversee the whole project, assigning work to various subcontractors. But that wasn’t working.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wanted a change, but there was no clear alternative. “We have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness for a life of eternal bliss,” he said to Surabhi. “But instead of eternal bliss, I am suffering eternal anxiety.” He appealed to Surabhi, Girirāja, and the others to do something.\nOne day a life member, a construction engineer, visited the site and told Śrīla Prabhupāda the temple and hotel could easily be completed in six months. Prabhupāda then berated Surabhi, who said that six months’ time was not enough. “Now I am nowhere,” thought Surabhi. “I’m losing my service.”\nThen another life member, Mr. Omkar Prakash Dir, the chief engineer with E.C.C., one of India’s largest, most reputable construction companies, came to the Sunday feast and examined the work. Appalled at the poor quality, he said that after two or three years it would fall apart.\nGirirāja, impressed with the idea of hiring Bombay’s biggest, most competent construction firm, spoke with Prabhupāda, who was also interested. At first Surabhi resented that the work was being taken out of his hands, but after meeting with Mr. Dir, he also liked the proposed change.\nThe contract was made with E.C.C., and Mr. Dir presented a progress chart, detailing each phase of the work and showing when it would be completed. Śrīla Prabhupāda was pleased with their professional methods, despite the higher cost. Now the work would be done as professionally and as quickly as possible, and this was what mattered most.\nPrabhupāda stayed for the greater part of November, and the construction progressed quickly. There was no question of cutting corners to save a little money, Prabhupāda explained to Surabhi. The temple had to be a beautiful jewel, so that people from all over India would want to come and stay. During the Vṛndāvana construction Prabhupāda had emphasized, “Why so much? Why not just simple?” But now he was stressing, “Why not more?” The temple should be opulent and ornate, with marble everywhere. The hotel should be the finest, with beautifully furnished rooms and an elegant restaurant. And the air-conditioned theater building should be one of the best in Bombay.\n“Why not marble on the floors?” asked Prabhupāda, speaking of the hotel rooms.\n“It’s going to be very expensive,” said Surabhi.\n“Don’t worry about the money,” Prabhupāda said. “Can we put marble on the floor? Then do it.” Surabhi did it, but tried to save money by putting a cheaper stone in the hotel hallways. When Prabhupāda saw it, he was displeased. It should have been all marble, he said.\nWhen the temple president from ISKCON Denver wrote asking about starting a jewelry business, Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote back, disapproving.\nPrabhupāda envisioned that book distribution could not only finance Bombay construction but could also support his even more ambitious plans for Māyāpur. Book distribution was good business, and it was the best preaching. It was Prabhupāda’s formula – American money combined with India’s spiritual culture – and he encouraged Rāmeśvara to motivate thesaṅkīrtanain the U.S.A. in accordance with this principle."

        "content": "DURING 1975 ŚRĪLA Prabhupāda increasingly referred management problems to the G.B.C., specifically to the annual G.B.C. meeting in Māyāpur. From the beginning of ISKCON he had been saying, “It is not one man’s work.” He had created the Governing Body Commission to relieve himself of the staggering burden of personally managing his growing world organization. “Always remember,” he had written to a G.B.C. member, “that you are one of the few leaders I have given this responsibility to … and your task is very great.”\nPrabhupāda saw the progress of his movement as a wonderfully successful phenomenon, proof of the direct mercy of Lord Caitanya upon his humble efforts. ISKCON was his service to his Guru Mahārāja, and now his disciples should maintain it and increase it as their service to their spiritual master. He said he wanted to see 108 flourishing temples before his departure from the world. Keeping those temples alive was to be the work of his sincere followers. He wrote to his G.B.C. representative for Australia,\nProblems were inevitable for a preacher of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Manysādhus,therefore, preferred to remain in a holy place, without preaching. But Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī and the greatācāryasin thesampradāyaof Lord Caitanya had been concerned with offering the Lord’s devotional service to as many conditioned souls as possible.\nYet to take up this path one would have to be tolerant. Financial needs, national and local governmental restrictions, ignorant and demoniac enemies of pure devotion to the Lord, envy, personal ambition and disagreements among neophyte devotees, struggles and falldowns in the attempt to avoid illicit sex and intoxication – all these and many more problems complicated the preacher’s mission. Śrīla Prabhupāda, however, knew the struggle was worth it, even to save just one soul from the cycle of birth and death.\nPrabhupāda wanted his more advanced disciples to share the struggle with him. And when he saw competence and sincerity in some of his senior members, he tried to turn affairs over to them and concentrate more on his life’s mission of presenting all twelve cantos ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Always the devotees were enthusiastically pressing Prabhupāda to translate and write more books – so that they could read them and distribute them. Śrīla Prabhupāda replied that he was trying his best, but that the task was not mechanical; great concentration and peace of mind were required. He could not write while at the same time being besieged by dozens of threatening, complicated issues.\nWhen the G.B.C. member responsible for Gurukula wrote Śrīla Prabhupāda with a plan that all ISKCON centers should support the educational system, Prabhupāda replied, “As far as taxing the centers for the maintenance, that should be considered amongst the G.B.C.”\nWhen a controversy arose in the Stockholm center and devotees appealed to Prabhupāda for a judgment, he replied, “This must be considered at a full meeting of the G.B.C.” And he added, “All of our students will have to becomeguru,but they are not qualified.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that sexual attraction, making unnecessary changes, and fighting among Godbrothers were all Western “diseases.” Kṛṣṇa consciousness was the path of perfection, and if his disciples stayed persistently and sincerely on the path, they could certainly succeed.\nSometimes, however, Prabhupāda saw the Western diseases overcoming his disciples, and even the G.B.C. members would seem unable to stop it. Yet unless they spared him from such headaches, how could he do the higher work? “G.B.C.,” he said, “must mean that by his managing, there are not any complaints, so that I can be relieved to do the translation work.”\nHe had expounded on this principle in the Fourth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nBut it was like trying to control the wind. When the difficulties mounted, the devotees would run to him like children running to their father. Sometimes a disciple would simultaneously ask him to write his books and then drop a serious problem in his lap. One of the leaders in America reported to him that some devotees were not following the principles, but that Śrīla Prabhupāda should please stay in India and continue writing peacefully. Prabhupāda wrote back,\nSometimes Śrīla Prabhupāda uttered the phrase “let me sit in Vṛndāvana,” as if to give up managing the whole problematic Society. Everyone knew he would never leave ISKCON; he had already sacrificed his life to save the world by leading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. But when would his disciples mature? Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote, “I want that the G.B.C. relieve me of all management, which means they have to manage the way I manage.” And often he would say, “Do as I am doing.”\nWhen controversies and disagreements among the G.B.C. secretaries themselves came before him, he would refer them to the G.B.C. body.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued to hold the G.B.C. responsible for settling the affairs of ISKCON. For better or worse, he wanted all his disciples to accept the G.B.C. as their authority, and he trusted that when the G.B.C. members all met together, working under his guidance, they could solve the problems. But whether they could actually spare him, allowing him to peacefully write his books, seemed doubtful.\nDuring 1975, a controversy arose among some of the ISKCON members, including some of the G.B.C. members, as to whethergṛhasthadevotees, married men, could actually be spiritual leaders in ISKCON. Although the Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy clearly explained that any devotee, regardless of hisāśrama,could become qualified and purified, the controversy grew.\nIn September asannyāsīG.B.C. member flew from the U.S. to Vṛndāvana just to suggest to Prabhupāda that another G.B.C. member, agṛhastha,was not qualified to lead. Śrīla Prabhupāda, however, said the matter could be settled at the annual G.B.C. meeting. But when the next day a letter came from Rāmeśvara, supplicating Prabhupāda to continue his translating work, Prabhupāda replied that he was prepared to work at his writing but that when one leader flies ten thousand miles to lodge a complaint against another, then, “What can I do?”\nAs the third annual international festival approached, the longstanding problems of various discontented parties awaited settlement in the court of the G.B.C. Śrīla Prabhupāda would be arriving in Māyāpur on January 17, almost two months before the G.B.C. meetings and the gathering of devotees. With perhaps a thousand devotees attending, there would be blissfulkīrtanas,classes, andparikramas.And there would be problems. Prabhupāda made it clear that the proper way of settling the controversies was not by gossiping about them, not by pressing him for a ruling, but by trusting in the G.B.C. Prabhupāda himself would stand by the decisions of the G.B.C. or, if necessary, correct them, and so sincere followers should also not hesitate to follow.\nJanuary 17, 1976Enroute from Calcutta to Māyāpur, Prabhupāda stopped at the mango grove and took breakfast – fruit,vaḍa,nuts, and sweets. Even before reaching Māyāpur, he was enjoying the peaceful atmosphere of the Bengal countryside. Soon he would be at the Māyāpur Chandrodaya Mandir, his special place of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nMore than fifty adult devotees and thirty young Bengaligurukulaboys were waiting for Śrīla Prabhupāda at the gate. For the first time, Prabhupāda beheld the large entrance dome, recently built over the gate. A thick, twenty-foot flower garland stretched across the gateway, and before it stood Bhavānanda Goswami, holding a small silk cushion on which rested a pair of scissors. Stepping out of the car into the bright sunlight, Prabhupāda took the scissors and cut the garland, sanctifying the gate. Prabhupāda smiled. Everyone cheered as the gate swung open and Prabhupāda entered, followed by the ecstatickīrtanaparty.\nAs Prabhupāda walked toward the temple of Rādhā-Mādhava, everywhere he looked he saw blossoming flowers. Clay pots of burning frankincense billowed fragrant smoke, and women stood on the second-floor veranda offering showers of rose petals as Prabhupāda approached. The main building was decorated beautifully. Walking beneath an orange silk umbrella amid the devotees and exuberantkīrtanaof the holy name, he appeared regal and triumphant.\nInside the temple, where dozens of garlands hung from the ceiling, Prabhupāda came before the golden forms of Rādhā-Mādhava and offered prostrated obeisances. He felt he was in Vaikuṇṭha. Because of the arrangements the devotees had made, he said, Kṛṣṇa was smiling.\nLater that day, as Prabhupāda was taking his massage, his servant Hari-śauri suggested that this would be a good place for retirement. “Either Vṛndāvana or Māyāpur,” Prabhupāda replied. “No other place. That is sure.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda walked down to the bank of the Jalāṅgī to see the boat the devotees were using for traveling from village to village. Onboard, he praised the simple life of traveling and preaching. He also went to thegośālāand saw the calves and cows, and he drank a cup of the first sugarcane juice of the season, from cane grown on the ISKCON land.\nAs Śrīla Prabhupāda walked through the fields to the proposed site of the Māyāpur city, Surabhi described where various buildings could be located. Prabhupāda suggested they present their plan to West Bengal government officials and ask them to provide the necessary land.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued to meditate on the Māyāpur city, and a few days later he composed a letter to the chief secretary of West Bengal, asking for help in acquiring land. ISKCON should not be misunderstood as a sectarian religious institution, he informed the chief secretary. Kṛṣṇa’s instructions inBhagavad-gītā,beginning with “We are not the body,” were scientific and thus did not belong to any particular religion. Prabhupāda also asserted that ISKCON programs, especially the one contemplated for Māyāpur, would solve national and international problems through spiritual education. He mentioned features that would be particularly appealing to the chief secretary, such as the investment of foreign capital in the project, the flow of tourists who would come to Māyāpur, and the hiring of thousands of local workers for constructing and maintaining the city. His description of the project was fascinating.\nIn his letter Śrīla Prabhupāda referred to difficulties in purchasing land for ISKCON’s projects, since all the local landowners were escalating their prices far beyond the market value. If the government could make the land available at market prices, then ISKCON could immediately start its important work, officially inaugurating it on the birthday anniversary of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, March 16, 1976.\nIn the meantime, Prabhupāda was trying on his own to acquire enough land to begin. The Māyāpur City project would require extensive funding and many years of work to develop, but it would proclaim the glories of Lord Caitanya with unlimited potency. Māyāpur would become famous, drawing people from all over the world to see the unique, modern application of timeless Vedic wisdom.\nPrabhupāda explained to his disciples that although asannyāsītraditionally does not involve himself with money, the devotee’s desire is to unite Lakṣmī (the goddess of fortune, represented by wealth) with Nārāyaṇa (God). He said there was truth to the common saying “No one listens to a poor man,” and were he to advertise A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami discoursing in an empty field in Māyāpur, no one would come. Westerners especially should be able to hear about Kṛṣṇa in a comfortable, attractive setting. Prabhupāda planned, therefore, that visitors to ISKCON’s transcendental city be well accommodated. Gradually, the world would be deeply affected by the dynamic demonstration of the artistic, philosophical, and humanitarian aspects of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nPrabhupāda asked Surabhi to draw a master plan for Māyāpur City. Staying up all night, Surabhi made a preliminary architectural sketch, showing specific areas of the city forbrāhmaṇas,kṣatriyas,vaiśyas,andśūdras.The sketch also showed temples, schools, streets, walkways, residential buildings, cottages, a stadium and an airport, as well as self-sufficiency features like windmills, irrigation systems, and agricultural fields.\nPrabhupāda was taking his massage when Surabhi brought him the drawing. Prabhupāda’s golden body was glistening with mustard oil as Hari-śauri carefully, strongly massaged his head, back, chest, and limbs. Prabhupāda was relaxed and silent, his eyes closed in meditation. But when Surabhi entered with the drawing of Māyāpur, he became animated. Prabhupāda liked the drawing and talked about it for an hour. Now Surabhi should make a formal drawing and approach professional architects and appropriate government agencies. The devotees coming to Māyāpur should also see it. As fabulous and far-reaching as it was, the Māyāpur City should now become a reality.\n“To becomesannyāsī,” Prabhupāda replied, “the other three processes are there – to becomebrahmacārī,to becomegṛhastha,and to becomevānaprastha.Stage by stage. But if one is able, he can takesannyāsa.And that competency is also very simple. If you become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, then you can immediately become competent –brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.As soon as you fully engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then immediately you become more than asannyāsī.”\nHari-śauri, agṛhastha,inquired whether artificially accepting the renounced order could actually be indulging in another form of sense gratification.\n“As soon as we manufacture something,” Prabhupāda replied, “that is sense gratification. When we think, ‘I want to fulfill my desire, that’s all,’ that is sense gratification. It may be that I sit down under a tree or I sit down in a palace – the basic principle is sense gratification. The other day I was talking abouthīrā-corāandkīrā-corā. Hīrāmeans ‘diamond,’ andkīrāmeans ‘cucumber.’ One is thinking, ‘I shall steal one cucumber,’ and another thinks, ‘If I steal, I shall steal the diamond.’ But the stealing propensity is there. One may think that ‘I am only stealing a cucumber, and it is not very dangerous,’ but in the eyes of the law both of them are criminal. So if we manufacture a concoction – ‘Yes, I have got a stealing propensity, but I’ll not steal a diamond, I’ll stealkīrā’ – that is only mental concoction. But he is a thief.”\nJayapatāka Swami: “So isgṛhasthalife in Kṛṣṇa consciousness allowing us to stealkīrā?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes,kīrā-corā.The prostitute hunter ishīrā-corā,and the householder iskīrā-corā.That’s all.”\nAgain Hari-śauri inquired whether artificial renunciation was sense gratification. There were different views among the disciples, and they wanted Prabhupāda to make it very clear, so that one party could not take a quote from Prabhupāda and claim it was universal.\n“Renunciation is not artificial,” said Prabhupāda. “It is a process. We have to give up this sense gratification. So go through a process to turn. Like sometimes in a health club there is artificial swimming, is it not? Artificial swimming is not actual swimming, but it is to practice.”\nDayānanda: “But sometimes people who renounce, they become very proud. What is that?”\nPrabhupāda continued to reply that renunciation had to be actually practiced. “Everyone must attend themaṅgala-ārati,” he said. “Onemustattend this. Otherwise, noprasādam.If you are too sick, then also you should not eat. There should not be sleeping at the time ofmaṅgala-āratibecause he says he’s sick, then at the time ofprasādam,voracious eating.”\nIf the devotees were looking for Prabhupāda to make an absolute distinction betweengṛhasthaandsannyāsī,it was not there. He emphasized, rather, the actual quality and the practice of the individual devotee.\nOn another morning walk Hṛdayānanda Goswami told Prabhupāda of thesannyāsīs’discussions.\nHṛdayānanda: “We were thinking that it would be nice to have the city centers for the preachers. And for the women and children, it’s much easier to maintain them on our farms. There they can do a little work and produce their own food.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. In the farms they can live and do some handwork.”\nGurukṛpā Swami: “They won’t do it, though, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then you don’t allow. If they do not follow the rules and regulations, then what is the use?”\nAnothersannyāsīsaid that when many householders came together in big communities, an atmosphere of laziness developed, whereas when lots ofbrahmacārīswere preaching together, it was more enlivening.\nPrabhupāda: “Anyway, everyone should be engaged. That’s all. No idle life. Never encourage laziness. If we maintain some lazy men, then everything will be spoiled.”\nDevotee: “I heard, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you remarked our Society is not a love-making Society, but these things are going on.”\nReferring to an impropriety of two of his disciples, Prabhupāda replied, “Yes, I have seen in Vṛndāvana.”\nOther complaints arose. One leader argued that the temple should not have to carry the burden of maintaining women with children but no husbands. Another complaint was thatbrahmacārīs,by selling books, were in effect supporting the householders.\nPrabhupāda continued to reply in a philosophical and practical way that whatever discrepancies were present should be rectified. Sense gratification, laziness, and failure to attend the temple programs should not be tolerated. But this condemnation of malpractices in devotional service did not fall exclusively on any particular group.\nShortly after his arrival in Māyāpur, Prabhupāda had addressed a similar issue in his own correspondence. A Mr. Chatterji had written from Calcutta to say that he was preaching worship of Lord Caitanya and was eager to show Śrīla Prabhupāda some articles he had written. Mr. Chatterji stated, “My theme is we can get to see our God, Gauranga, by taking sannyasa. Those who are grhasthas reach to the Godhead through nam sankirtana.” Śrīla Prabhupāda encouraged the man with a reply.\n“He says,” said Dayānanda, “that the devotees aren’t behaving, and so he’s criticizing. But they’re not accepting.”\n“Simply criticism is not our means,” said Prabhupāda. “Our means is to show by example.” Dayānanda made a note of it to use in typing Prabhupāda’s reply.\n“Now, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Dayānanda continued, “he’s inquiring about his household life.”\n“This is not the business of theguru,” said Prabhupāda “ – how to increase sex life and family life. They are not happy, these Western men and women. They become married, but they are not happy. Therefore I recommendbrahmacaryaandsannyāsalife.”\nSeveral other devotees were also in the room with Prabhupāda, and Jagad-guru, abrahmacārī,spoke up. “Because they have no training, that’s why they have so many problems.”\n“Whatever it may be,” said Prabhupāda. “But they are not happy. Therefore I recommendbrahmacaryaandsannyāsa.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had already been disturbed by what he saw as a loose husband-wife situation in Vṛndāvana. Now, hearing this letter from a householder who was improperly inquiring about his family life, he again turned his attention to Vṛndāvana and asked to see his G.B.C. for Vṛndāvana, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, who had recently arrived in Māyāpur.\n“It is not a free hotel for love-making,” Prabhupāda began, even before Gopāla Kṛṣṇa entered the room. “Vṛndāvana is not a joking place. They must be serious for Kṛṣṇa, and I shall give them everything. Don’t worry about money, but manage. There is not scarcity of money. There is scarcity of management. Why so many children in the temple? It is not simply a place for husbandless women. Children should always be engaged, so they shouldn’t create a disturbance all over.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that if the mothers were irresponsible and only wanted to take care of their own children, then they should be sent away from Vṛndāvana. Two women could run a nursery and take care of many children, and the other women could work. “Not go to the roof and lovemaking,” said Prabhupāda, “and make a plan and go away.” He stressed that since all India came to Vṛndāvana, ISKCON’s center should be ideal in every respect. Otherwise, people would think that his disciples were hippies, and no one would come. A good example of responsible care for children was in Māyāpur, where agurukulahad already been organized.\n“Children are welcome,” said Prabhupāda, “but make them jewels. Not spoiled children,varṇa-saṅkarahippies.”\nFor thesannyāsīsin Māyāpur, Prabhupāda’s heavy words about irresponsiblegṛhasthalife fueled their own arguments. A few of them felt thatgṛhasthasshould not even live in the temples. That evening, when thesannyāsīsgathered in Prabhupāda’s room, they discussed with him the position of families and children in ISKCON.\nOnesannyāsīreported not being allowed to preach in certain temples, because he was against marriage and favoredbrahmacārīlife. Others complained that expensive properties were being purchased to be used mostly as residences. The preaching was suffering, they said, andbrahmacārīswere being told to get married if they felt sexually agitated.\nPrabhupāda felt the heavy force of thesannyāsīs’protest, and he could perceive the antagonism between theāśramas.These things must be decided by the G.B.C., he said, and no one could go against their decisions. But he also expressed sympathy for what thesannyāsīswere saying. Families, he suggested, could serve in farm communities and live self-sufficiently in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n“Our whole preaching program is detachment from material life,” said Prabhupāda, “to stop sex life altogether.Gṛhasthais a concession for those who cannot give it up immediately. Otherwise marriage is not required. It is simply burdensome. Legal or illegal, the after-effects of sex simply mean difficulty.”\nMarch 7The G.B.C. members assembled. The process was to make an agenda, discuss each issue, and then pass resolutions by voting. At the end of the day they would go to Śrīla Prabhupāda in his room and read the day’s resolutions for his approval or amendment. The first day they spent mostly in assigning zones and duties for each G.B.C. member. They reported these results to Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he approved them.\nPrabhupāda also addressed the issue ofgṛhasthaandsannyāsalife, saying that all the devotees should become attached to Kṛṣṇa’s family, not to the “stool” family or “pig” family.Sannyāsalife meant rejection of the false family, but not the family of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness society was based on renunciation, said Prabhupāda, and therefore all sincere devotees were as good assannyāsīs.The actual dress didn’t matter, whether white orsaffron,*although an idealgṛhasthashould eventually come to the stage of formalsannyāsa.He said that all his disciples should becomegurusand each make thousands of disciples, just as he had, thus spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness everywhere.\n“Discuss in the G.B.C.,” he said, “and make a decision. Question and put to vote. But if you makebrahmacārīparty,gṛhasthaparty,sannyāsīparty, it will be finished. Everything should be done very openly. We have to work for Kṛṣṇa. Why thispss-psswhispering? It is not very good.”\nThe next morning while Śrīla Prabhupāda was on his walk around the Māyāpur fields, the G.B.C. vice-chairman, Madhudviṣa Swami, asked for guidance in preparation for the G.B.C. meeting that day.\nMadhudviṣa: “The subjects that we are going to be discussing today in the G.B.C. meeting are about the role ofsannyāsīsandbrahmacārīsandgṛhasthasin ISKCON. In the Eighteenth Chapter of theBhagavad-gītā,in one of your purports, you say that asannyāsīshould never discourage a young man from getting married. But on the other hand, we understand that asannyāsīshould encourage young men to remainbrahmacārī.So it seems to me like there’s some kind of contradiction.”\nPrabhupāda: “According to time and circumstance. Just like Kṛṣṇa says,niyataṁ kuru karmatvam: ‘Always be engaged in your prescribed work.’ And at last He says,sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam śaraṇaṁ vraja.*So now you adjust. That is not a contradiction. It is just suitable to the time and circumstance.”\nMadhudviṣa: “But is there some conclusion?”\nPrabhupāda: “The real aim is that you have to become the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. Either you go throughkarmaorjñānaoryoga,it doesn’t matter. The ultimate aim is how to reach Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna achieved the favor of Kṛṣṇa by fighting and killing. Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nPrabhupāda said no more. He had created the G.B.C. to deal with just such problems, and he had instructed his G.B.C. men personally, in letters and in his books. Now they would have to apply those instructions according to time and place.\nThe G.B.C. met, discussed all day, and by evening had a list of resolutions pertaining to the divisions ofāśramain ISKCON: Husbandless women with children could not live in ISKCON temples. Husband and wife could not live in ISKCON temples, even if separately. Before entering marriage, devotees should have a means of supporting themselves and not expect to “live off” ISKCON. Upon getting married, a householder would be financially responsible for his wife until such time as he tooksannyāsa.\nReading the resolutions to Prabhupāda in his room usually evoked little verbal response from him. His practice was generally to nod in approval, or occasionally to comment. But when he heard the resolution that husbandless women with children could not stay in the temples, he uttered a thoughtful “Hmmm.” Then he said, “As for me, my only concern is that they shall not waste their valuable human life.” He was speaking not in the tone of the official head of the society, who could veto resolutions, but in a very personal, humble way, as a pure devotee. “After so much struggle,” he said, “they have got this human form, and I do not want that they should miss the opportunity. As for me, I cannot discriminate – man, woman, child, rich, poor, educated, or foolish. Let them all come, and let them take Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so that they will not waste their human life.”\nAlthough the G.B.C. members usually had plenty to say, after these remarks from Prabhupāda they remained silent.\nFinally, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, the elected G.B.C. chairman for the year, spoke. “Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said. “So we will strike that resolution.”\nPrabhupāda also disapproved the resolution that a householder would have to give financial support for his wife for the rest of his life until he tooksannyāsa.\n“You each beguru,” he said. “As I have five thousand disciples or ten thousand, so you have ten thousand each. In this way, create branches and branches of the Caitanya tree. But you have to be spiritually strong. This means chanting your rounds and following the four rules. It is not an artificial show. It is not a material thing. Chant and follow the four rules and pray to Kṛṣṇa in helplessness. We have to have enthusiasm. If we lose our enthusiasm, everything will become slack. In old age I came out from Vṛndāvana. I had no money, nothing. But I thought, ‘Let me try.’ ”\nBhagavān spoke out spontaneously: “You’re still enthusiastic, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\n“Yes.” Prabhupāda smiled. “I am enthusiastic. I don’t think I am an old man.”\n“Sometimes we thinkweare old,” said Bhagavān.\n“No one is old,” said Prabhupāda. “Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.*Sometimes in old age one is pushed down. But I am enthusiastic.”\nPrabhupāda said he was pleased at most of the resolutions, because they indicated that a strong G.B.C. was now ready to relieve him so he could concentrate on his translation work. He said that the devotees would have to strictly follow for the entire year what the G.B.C. had agreed on. There should be no changes unless he approved, and at the next annual meeting they could make any changes necessary.\nThe G.B.C. chairman then called for a vote on an unresolved topic from the day’s meeting. The topic had been discussed, but since it had not been approved, the chairman called for a vote. Everyone voted yes by raising their right hand. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda raised his hand also. His disciples immediately laughed at this endearing gesture.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said, “I am simply following the G.B.C. Whatever you say, I have to follow.”\nPrabhupāda knew of the presidents’ discontent, and he brought up the subject on his next morning walk. Surrounded bysannyāsīs,G.B.C. men, temple presidents, and others, he brought out the issues, attempting to bring his spiritual family into harmony.\n“I have heard,” he said, “that too much stricture on thegṛhasthasmay cause some disturbance. Hmmm?”\n“Yes,” admitted Madhudviṣa.\n“So,” said Prabhupāda, “I think thegṛhasthasthemselves should form a small committee and define what they will do, instead of forcing something on them. Because in this age, nobody can follow strictly all the strictures in theśāstras.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa objected to the idea ofgṛhasthasrevising the G.B.C. resolutions. “In none of our resolutions,” he argued, “do we say anything about how thegṛhasthasshould live. The resolutions simply say how our Society should be run. It doesn’t say howgṛhasthasshould live. And on points of objection, Prabhupāda has already corrected us.”\n“I think it may be further decided,” Prabhupāda continued. “Make a small committee of three or fourgṛhasthas.Then you define how you live.”\nChanging the subject, Prabhupāda asked when thepaṇḍālwas going to be built. Today 350 devotees were expected to arrive from the West. Thepaṇḍālstage was supposed to have been erected, and festivities, including theater, would begin in the evening. But the devotees, irrepressibly absorbed in thegṛhastha-sannyāsīissue, could not refrain from pursuing it further.\n“That is the distinction between the enjoying spirit and the renouncing spirit?” asked Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Swami, returning to the theme.\n“Hmmm?” Prabhupāda asked. Although the question was pointed, he remained poised, and detached from their party divisions. His idea of what to do was definite, but his method of teaching it was careful and gradual. He already knew well the difficult task of satisfying divergent views among his strong-minded disciples. For years he had been making the ultimate decisions and teaching his disciples how to go forward in a united way. Once again, an issue was building that only he could solve – if they would listen.\nPuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: “For example, as we have been discussing, there are different tendencies between thebrahmacārīsand thegṛhasthas.The attitude of thebrahmacārīsis toward renunciation. If abrahmacārīgives up hisbrahmacārīlife to become agṛhastha,that means he is more inclined to the enjoying spirit. At least to some extent. So how to deal with this situation?”\nPrabhupāda: “If you want to enjoy, who can stop you?”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa: “But we cannot support it. We cannot support his enjoyment. That he should take on himself.”\nPrabhupāda: “According to different positions and attitudes, the fourāśramasare there –brahmacārī,gṛhastha,vānaprastha,sannyāsa.This means that everyone is not on the equal platform. There are different platforms. But the whole idea is how to give up the propensity of enjoyment. That is wanted.”\nPuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: “We find in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamthat Śukadeva Gosvāmī would approach the householders in the morning just so long as to give them a little bit of spiritual knowledge, and he would accept the offering of some milk. So thesannyāsīsand renunciants, generally they wouldn’t very much relish the association of householders because of this enjoying spirit and the association that it entails. So we are finding also within our Society that those who are inclined to remaining celibate, they are finding the association of persons even within our movement who have this enjoying spirit to be somewhat detrimental to their own spiritual life.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then what is your proposal? You should drive them away?”\nMadhudviṣa: “Unless there is association, then they will never become purified.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa: “No, that is not the problem, because everyone comes together for association. They come together in the temple forkīrtana,for lectures, forprasādam… These things are common activities. There’s no question that we should not have common activities between all theāśramas.But for living there must be separate arrangement.”\nPrabhupāda: “Now, even in the temple, you are complaining that a husband and wife are talking.”\nPrabhupāda seemed almost coy in the way he gradually led and manipulated the issue. He was also hearing more clearly the minds and hearts of his divided disciples.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa: “Yes, they are not talkingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.”\nPrabhupāda: “That you will find everywhere.”\nBhāgavata: “There’s a complaint that sometimes is made that there’s too much aversion on the part of thebrahmacārīs.But isn’t that a quality of abrahmacārī,that he should have a healthy contempt for sense gratification?”\nPrabhupāda: “I do not follow.”\nThe devotees crowded around as closely as possible. This was an important point.\nPuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: “He’s saying that sometimes thebrahmacārīsand even thesannyāsīsmay have a strong aversion to association with women and householder life. But sometimes thegṛhasthaswill criticize thesannyāsīsandbrahmacārīsand say, ‘This is fanaticism.’ Thegṛhasthassay that this is just as bad as the enjoying spirit, because asannyāsīis meditating on the same thing, except that he’s averse to it. So Bhāgavata dāsa’s question is, ‘Is it better to be neutral or to be averse?’ ”\nPrabhupāda: “These are all fanaticism. Real unity is in advancing Kṛṣṇa consciousness.Kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva … .In the Kali-yuga you cannot strictly follow, neither I can strictly follow. If I criticize you, if you criticize me, then we go far away from our real life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nPuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: “So is it correct to say that if we are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, then if it’s not thegṛhasthaproblem it would be some other problem?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. We should always remember that eithergṛhasthaorbrahmacārīorsannyāsī,nobody can strictly follow all the rules and regulations. In the Kali-yuga it is not possible. If I simply find fault with you, and if you find fault with me, then it will be factional, and our real business will be hampered. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended thathari-nāma,chanting Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,should be very rigidly performed, which is common for everyone –gṛhastha,vānaprastha,andsannyāsa.They should always chant Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,then everything will be adjusted. Otherwise, it is impossible to advance. We shall be complicated with the details only. This is calledniyamāgraha.I think I have explained it.”\nMadhudviṣa: “Yes, inThe Nectar of Instruction.”\nPrabhupāda: “Niyamāgrahaisnot good.Niyamameans ‘regulative principles,’ andāgrahameans ‘not to accept.’Agrahameans the opposite – too eager to accept the regulative principles, but no advancement spiritually. Both of them are calledniyamāgraha.So the basic principle is thatniyamāgrahais not recommended. If we advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the simple method of chanting twenty-four hours –kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ –then things will be automatically adjusted.\n“You cannot find in Kali-yuga that everything is being done very correctly to the point; that is very difficult. Just like our poet Allen Ginsberg, he was always accusing me, ‘Swamiji, you are very conservative and strict.’ Actually I told him, ‘I am never strict. Neither I am conservative. If I become conservative, then I cannot live here for a moment.’ So I am not at all conservative. I was living with one boy, Carl Yeargens. I was cooking, and I saw in the refrigerator some pieces of meat for his cat. So still I kept my food in that refrigerator. What can be done?”\nThey had been talking for over an hour, and Prabhupāda had given definitive instructions. But it was not over yet. It was clear, however, who was in control.\nAfter three hours on the road, the buses had entered Māyāpur, and soon the devotees were seeing the Gaudiya Math temples, the Śrīvāsa Aṅgana, thesamādhiof Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, and the birthsite of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all appearing one after the other, as the buses, horns blaring almost incessantly, veered around the winding turns of Bhaktisiddhānta Road. Villagers on foot and in rickshas, buffalo, goats, and cows moved hurriedly aside. Local residents looked up with curiosity and surprise at the sight of hundreds of Westernbhaktasarriving to celebrate Gaura-pūrṇimā.\nThen the arriving devotees saw, on the flat Māyāpur landscape, the pinkish hue and beautiful features of ISKCON’s Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir, the place Śrīla Prabhupāda had prepared for them, the home of which they had heard so much. As the buses arrived at the gate to the ISKCON property, the devotees cheered to see the new domes and fields of flowers. And their eagerness to see Śrīla Prabhupāda increased. There would be formalities of registering and receiving a room, a few complications in locating and settling in, but nothing major. They were home now among fellow devotees. Soon they would be able to bathe in the Ganges and to hear the schedule forparikramasto the holy places.\nSome devotees rested, while others met with friends from various places in the world. They shared the latest news and received experienced advice about the Ganges’ swift current and about avoiding dysentery and mosquitoes. By early evening they had all moved into their rooms and takenprasādam.Theśāhnāimusicians, in a small room above the entrance gate, began playing an eveningrāga.The sky darkened, and devotees began gathering in the brightly-lit temple room for a gigantickīrtana.\nThese devotees had been working very hard in various cities throughout the world, and coming to Māyāpur was like a reward for their austerities and patient service. Now they could relax and enjoy spiritual life, with no responsibilities other than to worship the Deities, to see and hear Śrīla Prabhupāda, to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and to simply be Kṛṣṇa conscious in the eternal abode of Lord Caitanya.\nWhen Prabhupāda heard that now almost six hundred devotees were gathered in his Māyāpur place of worship, he was very pleased. He inquired whether theprasādamand accommodations were sufficient and whether there would be a full schedule of engagements for everyone. Otherwise, he said, if the devotees remained idle, they would get sick or would gossip. He said everyone should simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, go onparikramaand engage inkṛṣṇa-kathā.\nPrabhupāda had praised the party, which was responsible for thirty to forty percent of the total remittances to the American BBT. Men on the Rādhā-Dāmodara party lived with spiritually advancedsannyāsīs;they developed traits of austerity and detachment and had an enthusiasm for remaining celibate, without a need for marriage.\nThe Rādhā-Dāmodara party broke all records for book distribution and outdid all other zones and temples. An elite army ofsaṅkīrtanasoldiers, they were the recognized world leaders of book distribution. More than eighty members of the party had arrived at the Māyāpur festival, and they were given a special reserved section in the best building for their residence.\nBut in their zealousness for renunciation andsaṅkīrtanaleadership, some of the Rādhā-Dāmodarabrahmacārīshad developed a condescending attitude toward temple life and householders. This materialistic conception had reached the point where some men were judging the worth of a devotee on the basis of whether he wore white cloth (as agṛhastha) or saffron (as asannyāsīorbrahmacārī). Anyone in white could not be a spiritually advanced devotee. At least, this was the misconception that the temple presidents felt had developed among some of the more immature members of the Rādhā-Dāmodara party.\nThe greatest grievance, however, was more practical than philosophical. The presidents claimed that the Rādhā-Dāmodara party was stealing men from the temples. The temple presidents compared stories and cited numerous instances to prove that men had been lured from their services in the temples to join the Rādhā-Dāmodara party. The philosophy thatsannyāsīswere superior togṛhasthas,the presidents said, was being used in an opportunistic way to convince men – the very bestbrahmacārīs –to give up their posts in Prabhupāda’s temple and join the Rādhā-Dāmodara group. This often caused serious difficulties.\nThe temple presidents considered the preaching of the Rādhā-Dāmodara party to be unbalanced and selfishly motivated. So acute had the disagreement grown that some temples had forbidden the Rādhā-Dāmodara party to visit, and some had banned Rādhā-Dāmodarasannyāsīsfrom lecturing to the devotees. The Rādhā-Dāmodara men, however, saw these restrictions as further proof of the householders’ small-mindedness and attachment.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda bided his time on the volatile issue and went about his duties, receiving guests and supervising the management of the Māyāpur temple and the festival. He was lecturing daily in the temple and satisfying everyone. To his servants and secretaries, however, he revealed that the schism was causing him anxiety. That the temple presidents were angry disturbed him. One afternoon, he could not even take his nap because of worry.\n“This is a very serious thing,” he said to Hari-śauri during the massage “ – this difference ofsannyāsaandgṛhastha.Everything will be spoiled.”\nHari-śauri compared the present schism to the schism that had destroyed the Gaudiya Math.\nAnother time, when sitting in his room, Prabhupāda picked up a decorative bookmark abrahmacāriṇīhad made for him. “Such nice service,” he said. “How can it be refused? I have never stopped them serving simply because they are women.”\nRāmeśvara came to Prabhupāda’s room and showed him some of the recent BBT publications. They discussed their business, turning at last to thesannyāsī-gṛhasthaissue. As Rāmeśvara began to offer his opinion, Prabhupāda asked that other availablesannyāsīsand G.B.C. men come in for the discussion.\nRāmeśvara was championing the temples’ cause, relating some of the financial and practical problems the temples were experiencing due to losing men to the Rādhā-Dāmodara party. When men left, then book distribution declined in those temples. In the face of the heavy propaganda for joining the traveling bus parties, how could the loyal temple devotees remain satisfied collecting money mostly for maintaining the temples, without being able to afford to distribute books? The temple devotees also wanted to have the ecstasy of book distribution, but that was becoming increasingly difficult due to the crippling tactics of the traveling bus parties. Rāmeśvara asked Śrīla Prabhupāda to clarify the philosophical misconception thatgṛhasthaswere not advanced enough to manage thebrahmacārīs.\nPrabhupāda mentioned thesannyāsīChoṭa Haridāsa, whom Lord Caitanya had rejected for only slight association with a woman. Yet Lord Caitanya had embraced agṛhastha,Śivānanda Sena, on learning that Śivānanda Sena’s wife was pregnant. Prabhupāda said that although Lord Caitanya’s relationship with Hissannyāsīswas different than His relationship with Hisgṛhasthas,both were transcendental. Thegṛhasthaswere encouraged to perform family duties and raise Kṛṣṇa conscious children.\nAddressing thesannyāsīspresent, Prabhupāda said that for them to be dwelling so much on the activities of the householders was inappropriate. It meant that thesannyāsīswere thinking about sex more than the householders were. If thesannyāsīswere thinking all day long about married life, they would become contaminated.\nPrabhupāda then told a story to illustrate his point. Once twobrāhmaṇaswere about to cross a river when a lady appeared, in need of assistance in crossing. So one of thebrāhmaṇasoffered to carry her on his back. The otherbrāhmaṇawas shocked, but refrained from saying anything. After crossing the river, the lady thanked them very much and went her way. The twobrāhmaṇascontinued walking, but for hours the otherbrāhmaṇacontinued to talk about the incident. “You let that woman climb on your back and touch your body,” he said, and he continued talking. Finally the otherbrāhmaṇacorrected him: “I carried her on my back for ten minutes, but you’ve been carrying her on your mind for three hours!”\nJayādvaita explained to Prabhupāda that the temple presidents felt the propaganda thatgṛhasthaswere incompetent to leadbrahmacārīswas actually just a device. The real issue was men and money. By telling the templebrahmacārīsnot to work undergṛhasthas,the Rādhā-Dāmodarasannyāsīswere able to lure the men from their authorized services in the temples.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa agreed that if such false ideas were circulating, then they should be stopped, but he maintained that his party was not actually perpetrating such a philosophy.\nAccusations passed back and forth before Śrīla Prabhupāda, who then delivered his opinion: “The standard should be not discrimination betweengṛhasthaandsannyāsī.We should simply see according to the advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya.*This principle should be followed – by his advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.Phalena paricīyate.Judge by the results, not by the dress. We can see his position. By making party politics, everything will be finished.”\nPrabhupāda said that abrahmacārīgenerally assisted asannyāsī,and asannyāsīwas a preacher. Thegṛhasthais also the appropriate man to take care of the temple. If abrahmacārīwanted to travel with asannyāsī,therefore, that was all right. “But if he has a responsibility,” said Prabhupāda, “he must stay.” The real point, he said, was that the devotees should all think of themselves as servants of the six Gosvāmīs. The whole problem before them was caused by “forgetting we are servant of Kṛṣṇa.”\n“It is not that a particular service is especially for agṛhasthaor asannyāsī,” Prabhupāda continued. “He must bekṛṣṇa-dāsa.A servant’s service is judged by the results. Why this party and that party?Yei kṛṣṇa tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya.Bhaktivinoda was agṛhastha.Bhaktisiddhānta was asannyāsī.Is one better than the other? No. So there should not be threatening. We are now worldwide organization.”\nPrabhupāda repeatedly quoted the versekibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya / yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya,thus dispelling the contention thatāśramadetermines the quality of a devotee. Whoever knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, whoever is fully engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, Prabhupāda stressed, that person is a pure devotee.\nAsannyāsī,Prabhupāda said, could preach, but he could also manage. Agṛhasthacould manage but could also preach. Although Prabhupāda had already brought up these points, now he was settling the issue completely. This discrimination, he said, must stop. It was not Kṛṣṇa conscious. And the G.B.C. should remove all resolutions discriminating againstgṛhasthas.\nPrabhupāda emphasized that the real standard was to bekṛṣṇa-dāsa,the servant of Kṛṣṇa. In that surrendered mood, a devotee should be expert and willing to do whatever service was needed. He gave the example that some fifty years ago, when he had been the manager in Bose’s laboratory in Calcutta, the workers had gone on strike. To the remaining workers he had said, “Come on, let’s pack.” They had accepted the menial labor, and the strike had been ended. Similarly, whatever capacity of service was required, a devotee should do it. “We must be very stubborn servant of Kṛṣṇa,” Prabhupāda said.\nPrabhupāda pointed out that he was probably the first bona fidesannyāsīto arrange for his disciples’ marriages. Certainly he did not encourage disobeying the regulative principles, he said, but the real business was Kṛṣṇa’s service. If that included arranging for marriages, then it should be done. “But generally the division is that thesannyāsīis fully engaged in preaching,” he said. “And thesannyāsīs’ preaching should not be checked. Whoever is in charge of something, let him remain. If there is some discrepancy, try to correct it. In every rumor there is a grain of truth.”\nPrabhupāda was not only defining and settling the immediate quarrels, but he was elevating all the devotees to the level of dedicated and inspired Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He was not siding with one party or watering down the philosophy to make peace. He was appealing to his disciples’ intelligence. And more than that, he was entering their hearts and making them satisfied and truly desirous of working with one another.\nWhen Śrīla Prabhupāda stopped speaking, he asked for a response. Jayādvaita said he thought the presidents would be completely satisfied with Prabhupāda’s decisions. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said that the G.B.C. would also be satisfied and that everyone, by Prabhupāda’s grace, could now go forward with the right understanding.\nThe devotees then left Prabhupāda’s room in a joyful mood, prepared to join the others and take part in an uplifting, nonpolitical Gaura-pūrṇimā festival.\nThe next morning Prabhupāda went for his walk on the roof of the Māyāpur building. As soon as he began circumambulating on the roof, at least two dozen devotees, mostly temple presidents andsannyāsīs,joined him.\nThe temple presidents felt victorious. Their positions were vindicated, and the misunderstandings of the philosophy had been straightened out. Now everything was proper. The whole affair had increased the devotees’ faith in Prabhupāda and in the wisdom of following his order without false prestige.\nAs they walked, Pañcadraviḍa Swami, in a mood of humorous relief to the tension of the past days, began questioning Prabhupāda in an odd way.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said, “there is one thing I don’t understand. In theCaitanya-caritāmṛta,that story of Sākṣi-gopāla – the Deity who came to witness for the youngbrāhmaṇa? So the young man was serving the oldbrāhmaṇa,and then the oldbrāhmaṇapromised the hand of his daughter in marriage, and then the Deity came to bear witness. So if he was such a pure devotee, why did he call the Deity to come such a great distance just so he could become married? Why didn’t he want to remain single? And why did he make the Deity come just for his marriage?”\nIt was not only the words but the way Pañcadraviḍa said them, jesting in the role of an overly-criticalsannyāsī.And Prabhupāda immediately entered the joking spirit: “We are not against marriage. We are against illicit sex. But because no woman would have you, now you are saying that no one should marry. Just see the psychology here.”\nThe devotees began to laugh wildly.\n“This is the sour grapes philosophy,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Because no woman will have you, nobody wants you, therefore you are feeling this rejection and thinking that nobody should get married.”\nSeated comfortably on hisvyāsāsana,Śrīla Prabhupāda looked out over his reading spectacles at the long hall full of seated disciples. Two devotees fanned him with bigcāmarawhisks. The many glass chandeliers sparkled. At the opposite end of the hall stood the forms of Rādhā-Mādhava and Lord Caitanya.\n“So here is a very specific statement about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu,” said Prabhupāda. “He isavatāra.Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He ischanna. Channameans covered, not directly. Because He has appeared as a devotee.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda explained why the Supreme Lord appeared in Kali-yuga as a devotee. “When Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared, He ordered everyone to ‘Surrender to Me.’ But they took it, ‘Who is this person asking like that? What right does he have? Why shall I give up?’ But God Himself, the Supreme Being, Hemustorder. That is God. But we think otherwise: ‘Who is this man? Why is he ordering? Why shall I give up?’ ”\nThe whole process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is submission, surrender to Kṛṣṇa, Śrīla Prabhupāda explained. But the way to surrender to Kṛṣṇa is to submit to His devotee, His representative.\n“So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared this day for giving mercy to the fallen souls who are so foolish they cannot take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is personally teaching them. That is thiskīrtana.”\nLater that morning Prabhupāda came down to the temple room again, this time to perform initiations. Fifteen devotees were receiving brahminical initiation, twenty-five were receiving first initiation, and seven men were receivingsannyāsa.Again Śrīla Prabhupāda quoted the verse that had become a theme for the festival:kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdrakene naya:“Either he is agṛhasthaor asannyāsī,it doesn’t matter. He must become aguru.How?Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā.One who knows the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one who understands Kṛṣṇa, he can become aguru.Guruis the post given to thesannyāsīsand to thebrāhmaṇas.Without becoming abrāhmaṇa,nobody can become asannyāsī,and thesannyāsīis supposed to be theguruof both all theāśramasand all thevarṇas.So, for preaching work we require so manysannyāsīs.People are suffering all over the world for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda cautioned the young men to live as very strictsannyāsīs.He also stressed that all his disciples should be training to become qualified asgurus.He quoted, “Yāredekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.Anywhere, either you are in this district or that district, it doesn’t matter. Either you are at home or outside home, it doesn’t matter. You become aguru –everyone. ‘How shall I becomeguru?I have no qualification.’ Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that you don’t require any qualification. You simply require one qualification, that you repeat the instruction ofBhagavad-gītā,that’s all.Yāredekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.You become aguru.Don’t adulteratekṛṣṇa-upadeśalike a rascal or nonsense. Present it as it is –Bhagavad-gītā.Then you can become aguru.You can become aguruin your family, you can become aguruin your society, your nation – wherever you are. And if it is possible, you go outside and preach this mission ofBhagavad-gītā.Therefore our movement’s name is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, you accept and preach. You becomeguru.”\nOn Gaura-pūrṇimā day everyone fasted until moonrise, and most of the devotees walked down to the Ganges to bathe. Jayapatāka Swami told them that, according tośāstra,whoever bathed in the Ganges at Māyāpur during Gaura-pūrṇimā would become liberated from birth and death. In the early evening, pilgrims began arriving in great numbers. From all over West Bengal, people yearly visited the temples in Māyāpur, especially the birthsite of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and more recently ISKCON’s Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir.\nIn Calcutta, people had seen the billboards advertising the ISKCON Gaura-pūrṇimā festival, and by word of mouth tens of thousands of villagers had heard about the longest building in West Bengal and the “golden” Deity of Rādhā-Mādhava. Devotees greeted the guests withprasādamand sold copies ofGeetār gan,Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Bengali versification ofBhagavad-gītā.\nBy nighttime long streams of people were flowing in and out of the front gates. The crowds raised a cloud of dust, and the air filled with sounds of ricksha bells, women singing, friends talking, and the amplifiedkīrtanaemanating from the temple. Most of the visitors walked through the temple, visited the photo exhibit, and then stayed for a while, watching thekīrtanaor the theater performance at the outdoorpaṇḍālstage. Although the number of visitors approached a hundred thousand, the scene remained peaceful, as people moved along without pushing or hurrying, observing the customary respect of visiting a holy place.\nĀnakadundubhi:Śrīla Prabhupāda would sit on the veranda looking over all of Māyāpur. I saw him watching some boys herding their cows. He was absorbed in watching the whole place. Then someone gave him a little pair of binoculars, and he would look out across Māyāpur, with one finger up in the air. He looked like a general. He was looking across to Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s house, and then he spotted the birthplace of Lord Caitanya. He looked at it very closely, and then he said, “Almost no men. They have no men.”\nSatsvarūpa dāsa Goswami:One day Prabhupāda called in the G.B.C. members. It was in the afternoon, and we could see he was feeling very blissful. He was hearing thekīrtanain the temple. He said everyone should come to Māyāpur and chant twenty-four hours a day. He said, “There is so much room here. The morning class is so nice – Prahlāda Mahārāja’s instruction a million years ago. A five-year-old boy was speaking. The chanting, according to Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, is the only solace. It is nothing material, the chanting. Ajāmila called the name of Nārāyaṇa and was saved.”\nPrabhupāda said that batches of devotees should come to Māyāpur so that there should always be five hundred men present. Then a devotee said, “In America they are trying to chant more, twelve hours a day, trying to get a twenty-four-hourkīrtanaschedule.” “Yes, everywhere,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “this chanting should go on. Instead of meetings, resolutions, dissolutions, revolutions, and then no solutions, there should be chanting.”\nGopavṛndapāla:I had guard duty, and Prabhupāda would get up around twelve midnight or one o’clock. He would be upstairs, and I would be one floor below. He was chanting a lot, pacing back and forth on the balcony. I couldn’t see him, but I could see his shaven head silhouetted. He was walking about ten steps one way and then ten steps the other way. I had a three-hour watch, and I sat there chanting myjapaand watching Prabhupāda’s head go back and forth. Sometimes I could hear when his chanting was louder. I was reminded of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, because Śrīla Prabhupāda described many times the balcony where Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī paced back and forth, envisioning and considering how to spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So Prabhupāda was also pacing and thinking how to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nĀnakadundubhi:In Prabhupāda’s room on the wall there was a beautiful sandalwood carving of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, just like on theKṛṣṇabook cover, with Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa standing, Rādhārāṇī with Her arm around Kṛṣṇa, holding His flute, and Kṛṣṇa holding His cape around Her. When there weren’t any guests fordarśana,Prabhupāda would just sit and look at that picture. He loved it very much. When I would take his garland up to him, he would wear it duringdarśanafor about an hour and a half, then afterdarśanahe would get up and go to the bathroom after first taking the garland off. Then he would come back and give the garland to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. A number of times I gave him garlands made of very fragrant little white flowers that Jananivāsa would give me. Prabhupāda used to take that garland and put it on Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in such a beautiful way. It was the perfection of Deity worship, the way he put that little garland there.\nJananivāsa:Just before Prabhupāda left, I came up and I asked him, “Frankincense, Śrīla Prabhupāda?” There was no one else in the room at the time, and he was just chantingjapasitting in his room. I started to fill up the room with smoke from the frankincense. Smoke was coming out everywhere, and Prabhupāda kept the windows closed. He looked up and said, “This creates such an atmosphere of spiritual understanding. This is so nice, so nice.” Then he started chanting again.\nPuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:When Prabhupāda was finally finished conducting the Māyāpur festival, I asked him if he was tired. Prabhupāda said, “What tired? So many people are coming and hearing about Kṛṣṇa. When preaching, you feel refreshed.”"

        "content": "EVER SINCE THE BBT Press marathon in the summer of 1975, the Press had continued to keep up with Śrīla Prabhupāda’s writing. A sweet, transcendental competition had developed between Prabhupāda, his Press, and the book distributors. In November of 1975, Prabhupāda had written to one of the leading book distributors,\nIn recent months, however, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s literary output had been diminishing, mostly because of his involvement in management. His direct supervision of the construction in Bombay, his month-long managerial drive in Vṛndāvana, his struggle to heal a major ISKCON schism – such activities were not conducive to writing. In Māyāpur when the devotees had failed to control the slamming of doors, he had complained bitterly that this “heart-cracking” sound interrupted his meditative translating. He explained that he sometimes thought for two or three days about a single purport before actually writing it.\nActually, the wordtranslatingis incomplete in describing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s writing. Translating involved only the verses and synonyms, but Prabhupāda’s deepest meditations – what he referred to as his “personal ecstasies” – were his Bhaktivedanta purports. Composing the purports, as well as translating the verses, came best when he could think about them throughout the day, not just when he turned on his dictating machine at one A.M. He was translating the extremely grave and complex Vedic knowledge into a modern context, thus making it understandable to Western readers. And it was a great, demanding task.\nTo best speak to the people of the world through hisŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamwritings, Śrīla Prabhupāda required a very conducive situation. After the Māyāpur festival, therefore, he formulated an itinerary that, in about a month’s time, would bring him to Hawaii. There he expected to find an atmosphere beneficial for his literary work. His traveling secretary, Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Swami, wrote ahead to Hawaii shortly after the Māyāpur festival.\nSince Prabhupāda’s itinerary also included another U.S. tour, his secretary wrote ahead to Kīrtanānanda Swami in New Vrindaban.\nHawaiiMay 3, 1976After brief visits in several Indian cities, as well as stops in Melbourne, Auckland, and Fiji, Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived in Hawaii on schedule. Immediately he began to increase his writing. The devotees were keenly noting the number of digits he ran up each night on his dictating machine, which for them was like a measure of the benediction for all humanity. Whereas in India he had done usually no more than a hundred digits a day, and sometimes none, in Hawaii his rate jumped to two hundred and even three hundred, day after day. Hari-śauri, who had accompanied Prabhupāda from Vṛndāvana as his servant, wrote in his diary, “Prabhupāda is translating like anything now, and he did 290 digits again last night.”\nThe temple was in a quiet neighborhood, with several acres of gardenlike property. In the backyard stood a large, stately banyan tree, and in the front, the largesttulasībushes anywhere in ISKCON. The devotees grew their own vegetables, and flowers, mangoes, and coconuts were so plentiful that they were available free. The weather was sunny, interspersed with occasional showers.\nPrabhupāda felt ill and could not sleep more than one-and-a-half hours at night and one or two hours during the day. But being transcendental, he used this inability to sleep as another way to increase his writing time. Despite his emphasis on writing, however, he continued lecturing in the temple, going on morning walks, holding discussions on the beach, and daily answering his mail. Still, Hawaii was far from being like Vṛndāvana or Calcutta, where old friends and new admirers demanded hours of his time. Here he was mostly alone with his trained staff.\nHe had been in Honolulu about a week when he announced one morning, walking along Waikiki Beach, that he expected to finish that night the last purport to the Seventh Canto. When Hari-śauri expressed his happiness to hear this, Prabhupāda replied, “Oh, I can finish very quickly, but I have to present it for your understanding. It requires deep thought, very carefully, to present it for the common man.”\nThat night around nine, Prabhupāda called for Hari-śauri and said that he would not take his evening massage; he wanted the time for finishing the Seventh Canto. Shutting the door and returning to his desk he worked all night until five in the morning. At the end of the Seventh Canto, he dictated a closing remark.\nImmediately Prabhupāda turned to the Eighth Canto, beginning with a prayer: “First of all, let me offer my humble, respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master, His Divine Grace Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Goswami Prabhupāda.” Prabhupāda explained that his spiritual master had instructed him at Rādhā-kuṇḍa in 1935 to stress book production more than temple construction. He had followed that instruction, beginning with his startingBack to Godheadmagazine in 1944, and in 1958 he had begunŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.As soon as he had published three volumes of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamin India, he had started for the U.S. in August 1965.\nPrabhupāda said he was making theBhāgavatamunderstandable for the common man. This did not mean his writings were lacking in substance; they were pure substance. But in the essential spirit of theBhāgavatamitself, Prabhupāda was omitting anything extraneous and distracting, selecting from the commentaries of the previousācāryaswhatever would best impel his readers to pure devotional service. At the beginning ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,the author, Śrīla Vyāsadeva, states that theBhāgavatamexcludes all materially motivated forms of religiosity and offers only pure devotional service.Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamis therefore called the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic knowledge. And just as theBhāgavatamis itself the most essential spiritual knowledge, so Śrīla Prabhupāda, in translating and commenting on theBhāgavatam,utilized the same spirit of delivering the pure message, without any speculation or deviation.\nAccording toŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam, kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam:Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the source of all incarnations, the cause of all causes. And Prabhupāda revealed this conclusion on every page. Although some Sanskrit scholars disagreed with Prabhupāda’s emphasis on Kṛṣṇa, his “Kṛṣṇa-izing” of the Sanskrit was not whimsical but followed strictly the ancient tradition ofparamparā.Overwhelmingly, those university scholars who seriously read Prabhupāda’s books appreciated the faithful quality of hisparamparārendering. Reviews came from all over the world.\nThe Vedic literature mentions various spiritual paths and forms ofyoga,and unless the commentator has realized the highest Vedic conclusion, he can easily miss the essential message of theBhāgavatam.Indeed, impersonalist commentators have attempted to use theBhāgavatamto support their speculations that the individual soul is in all respects one with the Supreme – even though this contradicts the purpose ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.As a commentator on the Vedic literature, Śrīla Prabhupāda was distinguished, even among Vaiṣṇava scholars, because of his being in disciplic succession from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is glorified aspatita-pāvana,the savior of the most fallen. As a follower and empowered representative of Lord Caitanya, Śrīla Prabhupāda was faithfully and perfectly carrying on the tradition of rescuing fallen souls, bringing them back to their original Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nPrabhupāda’s makingBhāgavatam’smessage “available,” therefore, did not mean mere simplification. It meant urgently addressing the reader to give up the world of illusion and take to the eternal liberation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Prabhupāda was making available to the average reader spiritual truth that had been hidden and unavailable, even to austere practitioners ofyogaand learnedbrāhmaṇasproficient in Sanskrit. “Old wine in new bottles,” Prabhupāda called it.\nThe Vaiṣṇava’s arguments against impersonalism had been chalked out by Madhvācārya and Rāmānujācārya and later synthesized by Lord Caitanya into the philosophy ofacintya-bhedābheda-tattva,“simultaneous oneness and difference.” These eternal truths had to be presented in every age, but in the traditional debates between the Vaiṣṇavas and the impersonalists, the authoritative basis had always been Vedic scripture.\nModern society, however, was so degraded that a preacher could no longer appeal to the authority of Vedic scripture – no one would accept it. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s writings, therefore, dealt with such theories as the origin of life by chance, Darwinian evolution, and chemical evolution. And he defeated them all with strong logic, establishing that life comes from life, not from dead matter. Prabhupāda had dedicated one of his first books,Easy Journey to Other Planets,to “the scientists of the world,” and had even adapted theBhagavad-gītāverses quoted in that book into scientific jargon of “matter and antimatter.” Deftly he used bothśāstraand logic to establish the Vedic conclusion.\nPrabhupāda’s writings also combatted the false teachings of bogusyogīs,gurus,and “incarnations,” who had appeared like a tidal wave of falsity in Kali-yuga, both in India and in the West. His writings criticized modern political institutions also, analyzing why monarchies fell, why democracy was also failing and how dictatorship would increasingly harass the citizens. The governments’ policies of abusive taxation and their propaganda to bring people to the cities to work in the factories, abandoning simple, agrarian life, were all discussed in light of the scriptures.\nIn his travels, Śrīla Prabhupāda had observed the rampant degradation of human society: sexual liberation, the latest fads in intoxication, and the vicious crimes of animal slaughter and meat-eating. ABhagavad-gītāpurport dealt specifically with the threat of nuclear holocaust.\nPrabhupāda’s criticisms were strong and authoritative, befitting a trueācārya;his uncompromising spirit was appealing. He was not a timid scholar pointing out some obscure historical references. Yet underlying his writing, a humble tone of request spoke to the heart. As the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa, he asked everyone to please take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness and be restored to his original, constitutional position of eternity, bliss, and knowledge.\nPrabhupāda was making his books practical. But to do so required care and deep meditation. He combined the thoughtfulness of a textual scholar with the practical applications of a transcendental social and political reformer. So many scholars had already presented their English editions ofBhagavad-gītā,yet not a single reader had become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda’sBhagavad-gītā As It Is,however, was creating thousands of devotees.\nMore than simply rendering valuable Vedic literatures, Śrīla Prabhupāda had come to the West, starting in New York City, to establish a way of life based on that Vedic literature. Consequently, he had gained firsthand experience in bringing the most materialistic persons to the standard of renunciation and devotional service. His books, therefore, reflected these practical realizations, and many times in his purports he would relate his difficulties and triumphs in trying to introduce spiritual principles within materialistic society.\nIn the Sixth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamhe had presented the story of Dakṣa’s cursing Nārada Muni, after Nārada had instructed Dakṣa’s sons in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The jealous father, considering Nārada his enemy, had cursed him to be always traveling, without any home. In his commentary, Śrīla Prabhupāda had written that he also had been cursed by the parents of his disciples; therefore, despite his having many centers around the world, he had to constantly travel and preach.\nAnd in the Seventh Canto, while commenting on the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu’s harassment of his son Prahlāda, Śrīla Prabhupāda had related the difficulties of the ISKCON devotees in distributing books amid the harassment of Hiraṇyakaśipu’s modern counterparts.\nThus Prabhupāda was imbuing his literature with the thoughtfulness of his own personality, that of a pure devotee faithfully dedicating his body, mind, and words in service to theBhāgavatam.As the wordbhāgavatarefers not only to narrations about the Supreme Lord but also to the Lord’s devotee, Śrīla Prabhupāda was himselfbhāgavata.And through his books one could gain the inspiration of service to both the book and the personbhāgavata.\nWhen news came of a temple president having difficulty with his G.B.C. authority, Śrīla Prabhupāda saw it as another example of how his writing work – his most important preaching – could be hampered by disruptions. He therefore composed a letter addressed to all the Governing Body Commissioners.\nWhile maintaining his excellent progress onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,Prabhupāda also got the opportunity in Hawaii to begin another book. His long-time disciple and editor Hayagrīva wrote, asking to assist Śrīla Prabhupāda in a series of interview-commentaries on the Western philosophers. This was the same project Prabhupāda had begun with his former secretary, Śyāmasundara, but when Śyāmasundara had abandoned his duties in ISKCON, he had also misplaced the tapes and transcripts of the considerable work they had done together.\nHayagrīva proposed to start again, beginning with Socrates and Plato. The process would be that Hayagrīva would present before Prabhupāda a summary of a particular Western thinker’s philosophy. Prabhupāda would then respond extemporaneously, giving appreciation and criticism of the philosopher according to the Vedic viewpoint.\nPrabhupāda and his disciples had been enthusiastic about the interviews done in former years, and Prabhupāda had even titled the series –  “Dialectical Spiritualism.” But when Śyāmasundara had misplaced the tapes, the project had dissipated. Now Hayagrīva, the former college English professor and original editor forBack to Godheadin America, asked to be allowed to come to Hawaii for reviving the philosophy book and for spending time with Prabhupāda.\nLike various other disciples, Hayagrīva had given up strictly following the regulative principles. Śrīla Prabhupāda had come to tolerate the reality that some disciples, even after taking vows of initiation, would be unable to resist the strong pull of the senses and would give up the path of active devotional service in ISKCON. In the early years, he and his followers had reacted with great shock whenever a devotee had gone away; but with time, as the unfortunate event had continued to occur, sometimes even striking down leading, trusted disciples, Prabhupāda had grown to live with it. But he never stopped feeling bereaved over a lost son or daughter, especially if that disciple had rendered him significant service. And he never withheld his affection from them or his open, loving invitation for them to return.\nSuch a case was Hayagrīva, a dear son who had come to Śrīla Prabhupāda during the summer of 1966 in New York. He had given valuable service, but had eventually been unable to follow the simple but strict principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now, after suffering the vicissitudes of material life, he had gathered his resolve to come back to his beloved spiritual master.\nPrabhupāda gave him a garland and asked him how he and his family were doing. Then in the presence of the other devotees, Prabhupāda related how Hayagrīva had been sent by Kṛṣṇa to help him spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world.\nWhen Hayagrīva said he had never forgotten Prabhupāda, even for a day, Prabhupāda replied, “And I also never forgot you. I was thinking, ‘Has Hayagrīva gone away?’ I was thinking like that.” Prabhupāda’s voice broke, his eyes filled with tears, and he could not speak. Finally he asked everyone to leave the room.\nPrabhupāda and Hayagrīva began meeting daily, sometimes for as long as two or three hours.Dialectical Spiritualismwas again underway, moving side by side with the Eighth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and Hayagrīva was again in his original position, at Śrīla Prabhupāda’s lotus feet.\nMadhudviṣa’s telegram was a resignation from the G.B.C. Although he wanted to continue in devotional service, he felt forced to resign due to spiritual weakness. The telegram gave no details, but Prabhupāda heard rumors that Madhudviṣa had had an affair and had left the temple. Prabhupāda said that this was his Godbrothers’ main argument against Westerners’ takingsannyāsa:they would not be able to maintain the strict vows. He said that a German Godbrother of his had also caused disruption by his intimate dealings with women.\n“What can I do?” Prabhupāda said sadly. “I am working with all third-class men – fools and rascals. Things are going on simply by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy.” Prabhupāda sent a telegram back, asking Madhudviṣa to come and speak with him. Although he restrained his emotions, the devotees could see that he was distracted. It was another case of a strong affectionate bond for a son who had rendered wonderful service, a disciple whom he had patiently trained over the years. Again the possibility of Prabhupāda’s retiring from active management looked doubtful.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said he was trying to engage fools, rascals – anyone – to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He was unable to find strict followers, but what could be done? If someone fell fromsannyāsa,he said, then that person could become agṛhastha.But no one should go away. Hari-śauri mentioned theCaitanya-caritāmṛtastory of Lord Caitanya and Choṭa Haridāsa. From that story, said Hari-śauri, it appeared to be very difficult for a fallensannyāsīto regain the mercy of Lord Caitanya.\n“One who falls fromsannyāsa,” Prabhupāda replied, “is calledvantāśī,one who vomits and then eats it.”\n“So if they becomegṛhasthasagain, then how can they get Lord Caitanya’s mercy?” asked Hari-śauri.\n“If the spiritual master gives that facility and makes that arrangement,” said Prabhupāda, “then Kṛṣṇa will accept the arrangement. And later he can again becomesannyāsa.” It had happened before, and Prabhupāda mentioned a few cases where he had asked fallensannyāsīsto get married and stay in their service. “Of course, it is a shameful position,” he said, “but what can be done? My Godbrothers andsannyāsīsin India criticize me for givingbrāhmaṇaandsannyāsainitiation and installing Deities in the West and allowing women to stay in the temples. But for all that, I am expanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And for all their strictness, they are doing nothing. If I discriminate, then I will again be one alone, as I was in Vṛndāvana, and ‘again become a mouse.’ ”\n“It seems,” said Hari-śauri, “that it will take several generations before we can become purified.”\n“If one is sincere,” Prabhupāda replied, “he can become purified even within one generation.”\nThat same evening, as Prabhupāda prepared to stay up all night translating, he was still thinking of Madhudviṣa. Nevertheless, he turned to translating the texts in the chapter called “The Elephant Gajendra’s Crisis.” The chapter told about the king of elephants, Gajendra, who lived on the heavenly planets. One day Gajendra was bathing in the river along with his wives, when suddenly a crocodile attacked. The crocodile fastened his jaws on Gajendra’s leg, and although the elephant was very powerful, he could not release himself from the strong grip of the crocodile while in the water.\n“Thereafter,” Śrīla Prabhupāda dictated, “because of being pulled into the water and fighting for many long years, the elephant became diminished in his mental, physical, and sensual strength. The crocodile, on the contrary, being an animal of the water, increased in enthusiasm, physical strength, and sensual power.”\n“I can do it very quickly,” Prabhupāda had said, “but I have to meditate, how to prepare it for the common man.” How could he convey the significance of this event, which happened millions of years ago between two animals on a heavenly planet? How to make it clear and understandable, and capture the essence of the significant Sanskrit words and theparamparācomments ofācāryaslike Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, and Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī? In the quiet solitude of his room, Śrīla Prabhupāda began speaking his purport.\n“In the fighting between the elephant and the crocodile, the difference was that although the elephant was extremely powerful, he was in a foreign place, in the water. During one thousand years of fighting, he could not get any food, and under the circumstances his bodily strength diminished, and because his bodily strength diminished, his mind also became weak and his senses less powerful. The crocodile, however, being an animal of the water, had no difficulties. He was getting food and was therefore getting mental strength and sensual encouragement. Thus while the elephant became reduced in strength, the crocodile became more and more powerful.\n“Now, from this we may take the lesson that in our fight withmāyāwe should not be in a position in which our strength, enthusiasm and senses will be unable to fight vigorously. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has actually declared war against the illusory energy, in which all the living entities are rotting in a false understanding of civilization. The soldiers in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must always possess physical strength, enthusiasm and sensual power. To keep themselves fit, they must therefore place themselves in a normal condition of life.\n“What constitutes a normal condition will not be the same for everyone,” Prabhupāda continued, “and therefore there are divisions ofvarṇāśrama – brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,andsannyāsa.Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is advised that no one takesannyāsa.…\n“From this we can understand that in this age thesannyāsa-āśramais forbidden because people are not strong. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed us an example in takingsannyāsaat the age of twenty-four years, but even Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya advised Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be extremely careful because He had takensannyāsaat an early age. For preaching we give young boyssannyāsa,but actually it is being experienced that they are not fit forsannyāsa.\n“There is no harm, however, if one thinks that he is unfit forsannyāsa;if he is very much agitated sexually, he should go to theāśramawhere sex is allowed, namely thegṛhastha-āśrama.That one has been found to be very weak in one place does not mean that he should stop fighting the crocodile ofmāyā.One should take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, as we shall see Gajendra do, and at the same time one can be agṛhasthaif he is satisfied with sexual indulgence.\n“There is no need to give up the fight. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore recommended,sthāne sthitāh śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.One may stay in whicheverāśrama issuitable for him; it is not essential that one takesannyāsa.If one is sexually agitated, he can enter thegṛhastha-āśrama.But one must continue fighting. For one who is not in a transcendental position, to takesannyāsaartificially is not a very great credit. Ifsannyāsais not suitable, one may enter thegṛhastha-āśramaand fightmāyāwith great strength. But one should not give up the fighting and go away.”\nFrom out of his direct confrontation with the forces of illusion, Śrīla Prabhupāda presented his realizations. He had taken the case of Madhudviṣa, refined it of its temporal aspects, and immortalized it into an instruction for persons everywhere.\nPrabhupāda’s job was to strengthen his disciples so they would not fall. Even if they took to thegṛhastha-āśrama,the crocodile of sense gratification was still very strong. And illicit sex was the “permanent disease” of the Western people. They were raised on it and addicted to it, and their society promoted it. To change this mentality would be very difficult. Therefore, in addition to writing, Prabhupāda would have to continue traveling and preaching to sustain his disciples and make them strong preachers.\nAs Prabhupāda had originally left his writing at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple in Vṛndāvana to preach in the West, so he could leave his writing retreat in Hawaii for preaching. In any case, he was prepared to continue writing wherever he went. All along he had planned to stay in Hawaii only for a month, not permanently. His disciples needed to see him for strength and inspiration, and as long as he had life and breath, this was his purpose.\nPrabhupāda wanted to first visit his Los Angeles center, now a large, thriving community of devotees. He would see their new temple room, with its marble arches and gallery of gorgeous transcendental paintings, and observe the opulent worship of the Deities Rukmiṇī-Dvārakādhīśa. He would see the latest technological applications of Kṛṣṇa consciousness at Golden Avatara recording studios and at the FATE museum, which utilized multimedia dioramas to depict the teachings of theBhagavad-gītā.He would sit in his garden and hearKṛṣṇabook and walk on Venice Beach discussing scientific theories with Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara. And, of course, he would increase the already swelling waves of book distribution. One day in the car he had said, “My books will be the lawbooks for human society for the next ten thousand years.”\nThen in Detroit he would stay for a few days in the mansion he had purchased over a year ago, to see how the devotees were taking care of the fabulous gift Kṛṣṇa had given them and to advise them on how to use it as a showpiece of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For himself, Prabhupāda was not interested in living in a mansion, and constant traveling proved difficult regardless of where he stayed. The mansions, the opulence, the American money and expertise were all for Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure.\nFrom Detroit Prabhupāda would go to Toronto, where a year ago he had encouraged the devotees and the Indian community to purchase a big church in the city. Now in recent months they had actually purchased it, and they were awaiting Prabhupāda’s arrival.\nHe would also travel to New Vrindaban, where for two years the devotees had been anxiously awaiting his return. They wanted him to sit on the grand newvyāsāsanathey had carved for him, to behold the Deities of Rādhā-Vṛndāvanacandra, and to grace the palace they were building for him. And they wanted to see him again with his dear disciple Kīrtanānanda Swami. He would drink the milk of the New Vrindaban cows and teach aboutvarṇāśrama-dharma.He would praise the simple life and blast away at the follies of urbanized, industrialized civilization.\nFor the fourth of July, 1976, the bicentennial anniversary of the United States’ independence, Śrīla Prabhupāda would be at the ISKCON temple in Washington, D.C., where he would holdkīrtanaat the monuments before millions of people; and on July 6 in Washington he would observe the tenth anniversary of the formation of ISKCON.\nThen he would go to New York for that city’s first full-scale Ratha-yātrā. He would stay in the newly acquired ISKCON “skyscraper,” the twelve-story building in mid-town Manhattan.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had sometimes said his greatest fear was that his disciples would fight with one another, causing serious splits in his movement. Therefore he traveled, using his great influence to unite all elements. He had seen how even those to whom he had given great responsibility could again become victims of sense gratification. But he had also seen how his being with his disciples strengthened them.\nHe was declaring humanity’s dependence on God, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and making a forceful revolution against the prevailing decadence of the day. Although America, in her two-hundredth anniversary, was abandoning her God consciousness, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s ISKCON was fresh and vital, instilling pure God consciousness in America and everywhere. The cover of the latest issue ofBack to Godhead,which Prabhupāda liked, depicted a devotee singing Hare Kṛṣṇa in front of a red, white, and blue bicentennial exhibit. The cover caption read, “Declaring Our Dependence on God.”\nPrabhupāda had complete confidence in the eventual victory of Lord Caitanya’ssaṅkīrtanamovement. Although now eighty years old, he was the leader, the strongest devotee. Wherever he traveled he brought life and strength, and so he continued.\nNew York CityJuly 9, 1976Jayānanda was driving the car. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami and Rāmeśvara Swami were also there. They had picked up Śrīla Prabhupāda and Hari-śauri at La Guardia Airport, and as they proceeded toward Manhattan, Prabhupāda asked, “Things are going on here nicely?”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa replied that everything had really just begun. “You will see that all of the work is just in progress,” he said.\n“Yes,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “manage nicely. Kṛṣṇa is giving us everything. There is no scarcity. If we simply sincerely work, Kṛṣṇa will give us intelligence – everything. By His mercy everything is available. That is Kṛṣṇa. He can give you anything.”\nAs their car approached the colossal Brooklyn Bridge, Śrīla Prabhupāda inquired, “That is Brooklyn Bridge, I think? Sometimes I was coming here and sitting down near the bridge.”\n“Near the water?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. They were fascinated to hear of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s early activities alone in New York. “You were sitting near the water?”\n“Yes, that river,” said Prabhupāda. “Because I was on that Bowery Street. It is not very far away. So I was coming, walking there, and sitting under that bridge and thinking, ‘When I shall return to India?’ ” He laughed. He asked about other places, almost like inquiring about old friends – the Fulton Street subway station and Chambers Street.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa told Prabhupāda that the ISKCON center was not far from the Empire State Building and that he would be able to get a nice view of it from his room on the eleventh floor. “Our building,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “is right in the midst of the theater, restaurant, and entertainment section of the city.”\n“In New York,” said Prabhupāda, “I feel a little at home, because first I came here. I was loitering on the street here and there. From 1965 September to July 1967, continually I stayed in New York.”\n“Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja gave a class this morning,” said Rāmeśvara Swami. “He was explaining that we cannot understand the good fortune of this city, that you have come here.”\n“Yes, when I decided that I shall go to a foreign country,” said Prabhupāda, “I never thought of going to London; I thought of coming here. Generally they go to London, but I thought, ‘No, I shall go to New York.’ ”\n“Very progressive,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa commented.\n“I do not know,” Prabhupāda laughed. “It is Kṛṣṇa’s dictation. I could have gone. London was nearer. But I thought, ‘No, I shall go to New York.’ Sometimes I was even dreaming that I had gone to New York.”\nAs they passed through various neighborhoods, Śrīla Prabhupāda recalled the old days. He mentioned Dr. Misra’syogastudio and his room at 100 Seventy-second Street, where his tape recorder and typewriter had been stolen; the West End Superette, where he would buy fruit.\n“Sometimes I think I was coming to this part,” said Prabhupāda, looking out the window, “ – aimlessly. Yes, sometimes walking on Second Avenue.”\nAcknowledging his senior disciple who was steadily and silently driving the car, Prabhupāda said, “Our Jayānanda was driving a taxi and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and one day he brought me five thousand dollars. It was given for the publishing ofBhagavad-gītā,but I think Macmillan took it.”\n“Then you put him in charge to sell all theTeachings of Lord Chaitanya,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “I remember.”\n“Didn’t sell too many books, though,” said Jayānanda. Prabhupāda laughed, while Jayānanda remained silent, intent on the task of driving through the city.\n“I thought he was the best, most appropriate person to drive you,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“He was chanting and driving,” said Prabhupāda. “Very good boy.” As they weaved through Manhattan traffic, a taxi driver shouted at them.\n“What does he say?” asked Prabhupāda.\n“He said you have a nice car,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “That’s good –  they like the car.”\nPrabhupāda laughed. “Ask him, ‘Why don’t you come here? Why are you driving a taxi? Come join us.’ ”\n“This car is the Ford company’s version of a Cadillac,” said Rāmeśvara. “They cannot understand, because we say we are not after material opulence for ourselves. They cannot understand why we drive in these cars.”\n“They think that we unnecessarily criticize,” said Prabhupāda. “But we require everything. Just like a man – when he is alive, his decoration, his nice dress, everything is good. But if he is dead, then it is useless. Similarly, without spiritual consciousness we are dead, because the body is dead. Only because the spirit soul is there, therefore it is moving. The important point is the spirit soul. So if you are simply taking care of the body nicely, that means you are decorating the dead body. What is the value of it? Is it clear?\n“The body is important because the soul is there. So long the life is there, if you decorate the body everyone will appreciate. But if you decorate the dead body, everyone will say, ‘What a fool he is!’ Similarly, without spiritual knowledge, this dead civilization simply on the bodily concept of life, it is ludicrous. That we have to condemn. Take Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then everything has value. Just like one – if there is zero, then it becomes ten. Add another zero and it becomes a hundred. But without that one, it is simply zero. It is only useless.”\n“That ‘one’ is Kṛṣṇa,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“And Kṛṣṇa’s representative,” added Rāmeśvara.\nAs they drove down Fifty-fifth Street, the devotees pointed out to Prabhupāda the ISKCON building, with the words Hare Krishna written in gold letters down the side. A large yellow banner showing a devotee of Lord Caitanya performingsaṅkīrtanaflew from the front of the building, and a stylish awning, emblazoned “Hare Krishna Center,” extended onto the sidewalk. At the sight of Prabhupāda’s car, hundreds of devotees at the entrance began to cheer and chant his name.\nIt was the largest gathering of ISKCON devotees since the Māyāpur festival. Many had come from distant places to be with Śrīla Prabhupāda, and more than six hundred devotees were staying in the building. Thekīrtanawas tumultuous. Standing before the Deities of Rādhā-Govinda, Prabhupāda appeared pleased. A picture of Lord Jagannātha, Balarāma, and Subhadrā was on the third altar, and Prabhupāda said he was anxious to see them on Ratha-yātrā day.\nAs Prabhupāda sat on the large greenvyāsāsana,he was at first too moved with emotion to speak. “First of all I must thank you all for bringing me in the new temple,” he began. “Because when I first came, my ambition was to start a temple here in New York, and I was seeking the opportunity.” He described some of his first, almost helpless, attempts to buy a twenty-five-by-one-hundred-foot space in Manhattan; but he had been unable to get any money.\n“I had no place,” he said. “What to speak of a temple, I had no residential place even. So in that condition I was thinking of returning to India. Practically every week I was going to the shipping company. So it is a long history, that I came here with determination to start a temple in New York first. But at that time, ten years before, in l965, it was not possible. But by the grace of Kṛṣṇa and by the grace of my Guru Mahārāja, you have got this place. So I must thank you very much for organizing this temple.\nLater in his lecture Prabhupāda stressed howguruand Kṛṣṇa were saving the conditioned souls from eternal suffering in the material world. “Don’t lose this opportunity,” he said. “Don’t be foolish, misled by so-called scientists, philosophers, or politicians. Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And that is possible only byguru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya.By the mercy ofguruand by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa you can achieve all success. This is the secret.\nSo thisguru-pūjāwe are doing, it is not self-aggrandizement. It is real teaching. You sing daily,guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete kariyā aikya.*I tell you frankly, whatever little success is there in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, I simply believed what was spoken by my Guru Mahārāja. You also continue that. Then every success will come. Thank you very much.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then toured the entire twelve-story building. He spoke little but approved of almost everything he saw. His disciples seemed to be managing things properly on his behalf. His quarters were well appointed, with separate rooms for sitting and resting.\n“So I shall again stay in New York?” he asked as he sat at his desk.\nĀdi-keśava Swami, the temple president, said, “This is your triumphant return, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied, “that is my sentiment.”\nDevotees were eager to point out the features of the rooms, the view from the window, and the relative quiet.\n“It’s very peaceful for translating work,” said Rāmeśvara Swami.\n“Oh, yes,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “When my Guru Mahārāja left, I was alone. So he has sent so manygurusto take care of me. You are my Guru Mahārāja’s representatives.”\n“We areguru-dāsa,” a devotee said.\n“So you are taking care,” said Prabhupāda, “and I am very much obliged to you. I sometimes think of my childhood. I was very, very pet son of my father. I had admitted that in the book. My father was not very rich man, but still, whatever I wanted he would give me. He never chastised me, but full love. Then of course I got friends, and I was married. So by Kṛṣṇa’s grace everyone loved me. And I came to this foreign country without any acquaintance. So Kṛṣṇa sent me many fathers to love me. In that way I am fortunate. At the last stage, if I live peacefully, that is the great mercy of Kṛṣṇa. By Kṛṣṇa’s mercy everything is possible. So we shall stick to Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet. Then everything is possible.”\nOne morning Prabhupāda went to where the carts were being built, and Jayānanda and his men showed him the improved construction of the giant wheels. Jayānanda, who was terminally ill with leukemia, was absorbing himself in the service that had made him dear to Prabhupāda and to all the devotees: organizing Ratha-yātrā and overseeing the construction of the carts.\nPrabhupāda would ride to Central Park to take his morning walks. Passing through familiar neighborhoods, he recalled the old days of 1965 and 1966. One morning Kīrtanānanda Swami rode with him in the car.\n“My best memories are those early days,” said Kīrtanānanda. “Especially the morning classes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you’d be sitting behind the desk. The sun would just be coming in, and you would talk for an hour.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “only Hayagrīva and you and…” Prabhupāda and Kīrtanānanda recalled some of the other early devotees: Umāpati, Carl Yeargens, Jim Greene, Rāya Rāma, Satsvarūpa, Brahmānanda.\n“At that time,” said Prabhupāda, “Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja was taking onecapātī.”\n“Nothing else?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“I would offer,” said Prabhupāda, “but he would take one or two, that’s all. Later on, one dozen. And that boy Stryadhīśa, he would take at least twentycapātīs.I would say, ‘Stryadhīśa, can I offer you?’ He would say, ‘Yes.’ I gave four. Again finished. Again four.”\n“Originally,” said Kīrtanānanda, “we all ate from Prabhupāda’s plate. There was one plate ofprasādam.And Prabhupāda would just give a little for everybody, and everybody would be satisfied.”\n“I used to keep someprasādam,” said Prabhupāda. “Anyone would come, I would give.”\n“After class,” recalled Kīrtanānanda, “you always distributed someprasādam.Afterkīrtanaand class.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “I was clapping my hands. In the meeting, I used to collect not less than six dollars, not more than twenty dollars. Three times a week.”\nAlthough Śrīla Prabhupāda’s triumph was that the early days of struggle were over, when he recalled them, he was immersed in a very special, sweet remembrance. He changed from one mood to another, and sometimes mixed them – the days of his helpless, utter dependence on Kṛṣṇa when no one else was present, and his present satisfaction, surrounded by hundreds of faithful disciples. While remembering the old days, he was now realizing his original goals for ISKCON New York, “the beacon-light for our worldwide propaganda.”\nOne evening, some of the devotees described to Śrīla Prabhupāda some of the abominable activities going on in the city. They told him of prostitution and pornography, of acts of rampant criminal violence, and of the strange fetishes and fads of the flesh-eaters, including the eating of human fetuses.\n“This means,” said Prabhupāda, “that we are actually preaching to animals.”\nOne night on the roof, Rāmeśvara Swami asked Śrīla Prabhupāda to reveal his plan for conquering the world with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Prabhupāda was silent. Finally he said, “No. Because if I tell you my plans, then they may be spoiled.” He had a plan, he said, but they were not ready for it.\nAt Thirty-fourth Street Prabhupāda joined the procession. As he came forward to board the chariot of Subhadrā, the devotees converged around him, amazing the policemen and other onlookers with their spontaneous adoration of Kṛṣṇa’s representative. Although the inner meaning of Ratha-yātrā is thegopīs’desire for Kṛṣṇa to return to Vṛndāvana, these devotees were more absorbed in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s return to New York.\nIt was a gorgeous, appropriate climax to Prabhupāda’s ten years of preaching in New York City. When he had first come he had had no money, no place of his own to live, and no place for people to congregate and hear about Kṛṣṇa. Now he was riding in splendor down Fifth Avenue at the Ratha-yātrā festival, and his Rādhā-Govinda Deities had a skyscraper. In 1965 he had been alone on the street, but now he was accompanied by six hundred disciples, loudly singing the holy names and benefiting millions of conditioned souls.\nIn front of Subhadrā’s cart walked Jayānanda, holding the steering tongue, keeping the cart on course. As Prabhupāda sat comfortably on the cart he fondly glanced at Jayānanda from time to time. Jayānanda, steering with his left hand, would hold his right hand upraised, cheering Prabhupāda’s Ratha-yātrā and rallying the others to pull the ropes and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.\nWhen the procession arrived, Washington Square Park was crowded with people. A temporary stage had been erected, and Śrīla Prabhupāda and the Deities took their places. Kīrtanānanda Swami introduced Prabhupāda before the crowd, and Prabhupāda stood up to speak.\nBeginning by explaining the significance of Ratha-yātrā, Śrīla Prabhupāda told the story of how the Jagannātha Deities were carved at the request of the King of Orissa over two thousand years ago. When the King had disturbed the sculptor before the Deities were completed, the sculptor had left. “But the King decided, ‘I shall worship this unfinished Deity, never mind.’\n“So the devotee is offering,” Prabhupāda continued, “and Kṛṣṇa accepts … if it is offered with love and affection. He says in theBhagavad-gītā, patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ / yo me bhaktyā prayacchati.Kṛṣṇa says anyone who offers Him a little flower, a little water, a little fruit with love and affection, ‘I eat them, I accept them.’\n“That means that even the poorest man in the world can worship God. There is no hindrance –ahaituky apratihatā –devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition. There is no restriction of caste or creed or country, nation. Anyone can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, according to his means.\n“And our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is a propagation to teach people how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is our mission, because without relationship with God, without reviving our eternal affinity with God, we cannot be happy.”\nAll living entities, Prabhupāda explained, are children of the supreme father, Kṛṣṇa, or God. But only in the human form of life can one understand his relationship with God. If one misuses his life and doesn’t understand his duty to Kṛṣṇa, then his life is spoiled.\n“So please do not take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement as any sectarian movement. It is the science of God. Try to understand the science of God. Either you accept it directly, or you try to understand through philosophy and science. We have got so many books. Kindly take advantage of this movement, why we are distributing so many literatures. Soberly and with calm head, try to understand this movement. This is our only mission. Thank you very much.”\nAs Śrīla Prabhupāda left to return to the temple,prasādamdistribution began and the dramatic actors prepared to go onstage with their rendition of “Kali and His Consort, Sin.”\nIn the evening the parade and festival received good coverage on all major TV stations, and the next morning, pictures and articles appeared in the newspapers. Prabhupāda particularly liked theNew York Daily Newscenterspread, where several photos bore a large caption: “Fifth Avenue, Where East Meets West.”\n“Send this cutting to many places,” Prabhupāda said. “Send it to Indira Gandhi. This title is very nice. This is the point. ‘East meets West.’ As I always say, the lame man meets the blind man. Together they do wonderful, and apart they cannot do anything.Heis lame, andheis blind. But if they join together – Indian culture and American money – they will save the whole world.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda heard from theNew York Timesarticle, which stressed how the parade included hundreds of Indians “who were pleased to see they could keep faith even in New York City.” The article quoted “an Indian immigrant” as saying, “We love New York City, America. It’s the most beautiful place in the world. No other country will give such freedom for our own ceremony.”\n“That’s a fact,” Prabhupāda said. “That I always say. TheTimesfirst published about my activities when I was in Tompkins Square Park.” At the festival site,prasādamhad been served to seven thousand people. And even when the devotees had walked back uptown with the carts late at night, hundreds of people had followed and chanted. The devotees were already talking about how to improve the festival for next year. They could have a press box, and Prabhupāda suggested they rent a small building downtown and call itGuṇḍicā.*Lord Jagannātha could stay there for one week. Then the devotees should have another procession and festival with Lord Jagannātha returning to the temple on Fifty-fifth Street.\n“Last night,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, “all night we were cleaning up the grounds at the park. So one woman who lives next to the park said, ‘In all my years of living here I’ve never seen such a wonderful festival held.’ And on CBS television, the official who’s in charge of the park said, ‘We are very proud to be able to say that this park was founded hundreds of years ago when America was religious and that spiritual life is still present in Washington Square Park.’ ”\n“So why not ask the mayor to construct a temple there?” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. The devotees all laughed. But Prabhupāda thought such things were certainly possible.\nBut he could not be bound by the G.B.C. – only by Kṛṣṇa. He already had his plane tickets, and he remained set on traveling.\nOn the morning of Prabhupāda’s departure, a few devotees came to his room to make a last attempt, begging him not to travel. He said nothing, though he was obviously set on leaving. His servants were packing his bags and everything was ready to go. Nevertheless, even as he left his room and got on the elevator, a few men followed, still suggesting he not go.\n“Prabhupāda, please reconsider,” said Rāmeśvara Swami. Śrīla Prabhupāda had remained jolly so far, despite his physical weakness, and despite his disciples’ pleading. But now his face changed.\n“Don’t travel,” one devotee said. And another added, “Just stay. Sit down and rest.”\nPrabhupāda turned, and his eyes were very deep. More than ever he seemed not of this material world. “I want the benediction to go on fighting for Kṛṣṇa,” he said, “just like Arjuna.”\nEveryone remained silent, and the important instruction burned into their memories. The elevator opened on the main floor and hundreds of waiting devotees chanted and cheered as Śrīla Prabhupāda walked to his car.\nOn the way to the airport the devotees again began talking about how degraded Kali-yuga was. “But you have to go on preaching,” Prabhupāda advised them. “You have to go and try to save these people.”"

        "content": "BombayJanuary 9, 1977\nŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA STARTED his morning walk before dawn. He and the devotees knew their way well through Hare Krishna Land to the public road, and once off the property, they turned left, then right and began walking down the block leading to the beach. The sky began to lighten. At first they could not visibly distinguish land from sea from sky. But gradually subtle nuances of color revealed the horizon, and they could see the vast plain of the Arabian Sea stretching to meet the even greater sea of sky, where last stars twinkled and faded. As Prabhupāda and his small group walked along the broad beach, they were flanked on their left by a line of leaning palms and on their right by a rumbling surf.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wore a gray woolencādaraaround his shoulders, a saffron silkkurtāanddhotī,and peach-colored canvas shoes. He used a cane, leaning not heavily on it, but lightly. With each brisk step he would point the cane ahead, poking it into the sand and lifting it again, rhythmically marking the pace. He walked erectly and held his head high.\nA long line of Bombayites, many of them wealthy Juhu residents on their morning stroll, appeared, and a few coconut-wālāsset up their carts, cutting off the tops of choice coconuts in anticipation of their first customers. Śrīla Prabhupāda liked to walk at this time of morning, and weather permitting, he would do so no matter where he was in the world. Juhu Beach, however, was one of his favorite places to walk.\nAlong the way, he and his disciples were joined by Dr. Patel, in white shirt and pants, and several of his friends, mostly doctors and lawyers. Śrīla Prabhupāda had been silent, but now he began to speak.\n“How everything is nice,” Śrīla Prabhupāda commented, gesturing toward the beach before him. “See the sky, how clear and how nice by Kṛṣṇa.Pūrṇam idam.” With his cane he indicated the tall, graceful palm trees. “The tree is calledvṛkṣa,” he said. “Thevṛkṣa-yoni,or birth as a tree, is condemned. By Kṛṣṇa’s arrangement, however, thevṛkṣasare also so nicely set up, it becomes beautiful.”\n“They are all representatives of Kṛṣṇa,” said Dr. Patel. “This is perfect.”\n“Pūrṇam,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, quotingĪśopaniṣad.“Pūrṇam idam, pūrṇam adaḥ.” Just as the rising sun illumines everything, Śrīla Prabhupāda discoursed, speaking against the atheistic notion that the complex material creation has no creator. “God’s creation,” said Prabhupāda, “is perfect and complete because it comes from Him who ispūrṇam,perfect and complete.Aṇḍāntara-stha paramāṇu cayāntara-sthaṁ / govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi. Paramāṇumeans smaller than the atom. Sixparamāṇusmake oneanu.That is atomic dimension – you combine sixparamāṇus.So in thatparamāṇualso the Lord is there.”\n“He made it,” said Dr. Patel, “and then He entered into it. That is what theVedasays.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “the Paramātmā is there. The whole human life is meant for understanding all this and glorifying the Lord. And they are wasting their lives by imitating the hog.”\nPrabhupāda again fell silent, except for softly uttering the Hare Kṛṣṇamantra.Now the beach was light, and many people, out on their morning walks or runs, greeted Śrīla Prabhupāda as they passed. The greetings were always words of respect, or at least “Good morning,” and Śrīla Prabhupāda’s response was usually “Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nSuddenly Prabhupāda again began to speak: “There’s a very big conspiracy against us.”\n“By the church?” guessed Dr. Patel.\n“Not by the church,” said Prabhupāda.\n“By the society?”\nPrabhupāda uttered a thoughtful “Hmmm,” then added, “Now they are determined to cut down this movement.” He didn’t give any details, and neither Dr. Patel nor the others could fully draw out what was on his mind. Whatever it was, said Dr. Patel, no conspiracy against Kṛṣṇa consciousness could take place in India.\n“I wanted to start this movement in India,” Prabhupāda replied. “I requested so many friends, ‘Give me just one son.’ But nobody agreed. They said, ‘Swamiji, what will be the benefit by this if I make my son a Vaiṣṇava or abrāhmaṇa?’ They do not give much importance to the movement. They are planning how to stop this movement in so many ways.”\nAlways a faithful Indophile, Dr. Patel replied, “The Americans are like that, always making propaganda.”\n“There is good and bad in every place,” said Prabhupāda. “Kṛṣṇa says,manuṣyānāṁ sahasreṣu.Out of thousands of persons hardly anyone is interested in perfecting his life. This is Kali-yuga.”\nThey walked on, and Śrīla Prabhupāda said no more about it, speaking instead of materialistic household life, in which the chief pleasure is sex. Beyond this abominable sex pleasure, he said, was the full satisfaction of spiritual life.\nPrabhupāda walked for half an hour and then turned around and began walking back, wanting to return to the temple by seven, just in time to greet the Deities. Some of the others were flagging from the brisk pace, but Śrīla Prabhupāda strode on, his golden-hued face triumphant in self-realization.\nPrabhupāda began talking about the importance ofsat-saṅga,association with devotees, and Dr. Patel quipped, “Instead of doingsat-saṅga,people go to Kumbha-melā!” He laughed, as if it were a good joke.\nBut Prabhupāda corrected him. “No,” he said, “Kumbha-melā issat-saṅga.If you go to Kumbha-melā to find a man of knowledge, then your Kumbha-melā is right. Otherwise,yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicit, sa eva go-khara.If one thinks that thissalila,the water, that just to take bath in the water is Kumbha-melā, then he’s ago-khara,a cow or an ass. But if he thinks, ‘Now there is an assembly of so many saintly persons, let me take advantage of their knowledge,’ then he is intelligent.”\nEver since Śrīla Prabhupāda had arrived in Bombay, he had been questioned about the upcoming Kumbha-melā at Allahabad. The Māgha-melā occurred every year, but according to astrological calculations, a more auspicious occasion came every twelfth year: Kumbha-melā. And every twelfth Kumbha-melā (an event that occurred only once in 144 years) was especially auspicious. This year, 1977, was to be such a Melā, and the government was predicting an attendance of twelve million at the confluence of the holy rivers near Allahabad. Śrīla Prabhupāda had said he would go.\n“So, sir,” said Dr. Patel, “you are going by train to Kumbha-melā?” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied that he liked the train, but Dr. Patel said it was not good for health and that it would be a very long ordeal. He also warned Prabhupāda that Allahabad would be very cold. And if Prabhupāda wanted to leave the Melā early, he would find it very difficult because of the crowds. “I’ll get one of my friends to get me some water from Allahabad on that day,” laughed Dr. Patel. “I’ll take my bath here.” Dr. Patel’s friends also mentioned the difficulties of extreme weather and crowds at Allahabad during the Melā. Śrīla Prabhupāda, however, was not swayed. He was well acquainted with Allahabad, having lived there with his family from 1923 to 1936.\n“In 1925,” said Prabhupāda, “I went to the Melā. I remember, I was touching the water, and it was so pinching that it was cutting your body. But as soon as you actually get a dip – one … two … three – then you immediately come out, and it is all right.”\nPrabhupāda mentioned the 1928 Melā, when he was carrying his young child. “I was in the midst of the crowd,” he recalled. “It was so big that I was afraid that if there was any rush this child may be finished. But, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, nothing happened.”\n“What is the reason for the Melā?” asked Prabhupāda’s servant, Hari-śauri. “Is it something about some drops of nectar from the Mohiṇī-mūrti?”\n“It is actually a religious conference,” Prabhupāda replied. “All the different groups gather in that holy place, and they propagate their philosophy there. India is a country of religion. They know spiritual life is more important than this material life – that is India. Now they are diverting their attention to the material. Otherwise, the whole of India is for spiritual life.”\nAbout five minutes before seven, Śrīla Prabhupāda left the beach and walked back to Hare Krishna Land. As he approached, he saw the massive two-story towers of the ISKCON hotel and the even taller and grander temple domes. The buildings, however, were unfinished. The temple domes had to be covered with marble, and all the buildings needed numerous finishing touches. Prabhupāda was anxiously anticipating the opening, but Surabhi Mahārāja spoke of delays. The opening date, therefore, remained indefinite.\nDelays had been routine ever since Prabhupāda had first tried to purchase the Juhu land from Mr. N. in 1971, and obstacles had plagued all his attempts to build. Now the triumph of installing the Deities of Rādhā-Rāsavihārī in one of the most gorgeous temples in India was near. Rādhā-Rāsavihārī were still being worshiped in the temporary shelter the devotees had erected in 1971, but as Prabhupāda approached, he could see the magnificent temple structure looming behind that humble shed, proclaiming that soon Rāsavihārī would move into His palace. Kṛṣṇa was blessing the faithful work of Śrīla Prabhupāda and his disciples in Bombay. Although Śrīla Prabhupāda was always traveling, pushing his movement ahead on all fronts, he would regularly return to Bombay. He, more clearly than his disciples, could see when the workers were delaying or even cheating. This time, as before, he would stay for a while, give advice, and then move on.\nOn returning to the ISKCON property, Śrīla Prabhupāda came before the Deities and beheld once again the charming beauty that made him sometimes indicate that of all Deities, these were the dearest to him. His promise to Rādhā-Rāsavihārī that he would build Them a beautiful temple was soon to become a living reality, but he sometimes expressed doubt as to whether he would live to see it. He was now eighty-one and was bothered by certain persistent illnesses.\nOf course, the warnings of death were nothing new to Śrīla Prabhupāda, as he had had serious bouts with illness from the beginning of his preaching in the West in 1965. Yet despite his frequent remarks about retiring, his disciples found it difficult to imagine. Yes, they should by all means complete the work as soon as possible and open the Bombay temple, and yes, they should assure Prabhupāda that he could retire and eventually complete hisŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.But of course, Kṛṣṇa would allow him to remain with them and see the completion of at least these two projects.\nRāmeśvara Swami inquired as a humble servant before his spiritual master. “Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said, “you look well. Are you feeling well?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda laughed. “At the present moment I am feeling well, because you are here.”\nWithin moments they were discussing ISKCON preaching and management, and Prabhupāda advised Rāmeśvara that the best policy was to use money for printing more books. As soon as money accumulated, Prabhupāda warned, it would be taxed and would cause headaches. Better to immediately spend it for printing books.\n“Print books and sell and spend,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Follow this policy and distribute these books. That is our main preaching. Somehow or other we must take our books door to door and distribute. Then our preaching is successful. Anyone who will read will get some benefit, that is sure. Because no other such literature is available throughout the whole world. It is a new revolution to the people in general.”\nWhen Śrīla Prabhupāda asked for news of ISKCON’s activities in the West, Rāmeśvara gave the latest details of how the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in America was being attacked in the courts and press as a psychologically dangerous, brainwashing cult. Śrīla Prabhupāda was already aware of this; it was, in fact, the “conspiracy” he had referred to on his morning walk. An anticult movement was now aggressively active and lumping the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in with other new movements. Śrīla Prabhupāda was well aware of the “deprogrammers’ ” kidnapping of devotees and intensively coercing them, and he had shown that he was not intimidated by the attack. He assured the devotees that Kṛṣṇa would protect them and that the outcome would ultimately be in their favor.\nThe most significant battle, one that had concerned Śrīla Prabhupāda for several months, was a legal case in New York where the temple president, Ādi-keśava Swami, was being charged with employing mind control to keep the devotees in the temple. The parents of two adult devotees had pressed charges after hired deprogrammers had failed to break the two devotees’ determination for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In a spirit of anticult crusade, an assistant attorney general was prosecuting, using all legal and governmental facilities at his disposal. Although civil libertarians were outraged and assured the devotees that the opposition could never win, the implications of the case were fearful nevertheless. The case challenged the very right of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement to exist as a bona fide religion and challenged the right of adult devotees to remain in the movement against the wishes of their parents. Also at issue was whether members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement were members by their own choosing or were being kept in the movement by psychological manipulation, “brainwashing.” When Śrīla Prabhupāda had first heard of this case, his reply in a letter from Vṛndāvana had been like a clarion call to battle against the forces of illusion.\nSitting with Śrīla Prabhupāda in Bombay, Rāmeśvara Swami informed him that a nationwide committee of professors and theologians had come to the defense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the New York case and that many lawyers and psychologists were sympathetic.\n“It is so much mercy from Kṛṣṇa,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Kṛṣṇa wanted all these things to happen. Kṛṣṇa Himself became important when He killed so many demons, not simply by lying down in the lap of mother Yaśodā. When He was on the lap of mother Yaśodā, from that day He began to kill. Therefore Kṛṣṇa established that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So even Kṛṣṇa was not exempted, what to speak of us. Prahlāda Mahārāja was not exempted. As soon as you speak of God, this opposition will come. Jesus Christ was crucified. They are so kind they have not crucified me or my men. But you have to expect all these things. Nityānanda Prabhu was personally injured. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was beaten in twenty-two bazaars. This task is like that.”\n“They are getting everyone in America to ask the question, ‘What is Hare Kṛṣṇa?’ ” said Rāmeśvara.\n“That is our gain,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “They are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\n“We still have to work very hard to defeat them,” Rāmeśvara added. “Oh, yes,” said Prabhupāda. “That is necessary. You don’t sleep. Never did Kṛṣṇa say to Arjuna, ‘I am your friend. I am God. You sleep here. I’ll do everything.’ No! You must fight! That is wanted. Kṛṣṇa said, ‘You fight, and remember Me. Then I’ll do everything.’ This is an opportunity of remembering Kṛṣṇa always.”\nPrabhupāda explained that the greatest shock for the materialists was that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement strongly opposed illicit sex, meat-eating, and intoxication. To them, for a person to give up these things was so shocking that they could not accept it was happening because of a genuine spiritual experience. Referring to a previous case, Prabhupāda said, “In Germany they also accused that the old man is sitting in Los Angeles, and he has engaged all these boys in collecting money for him. They are thinking that way, that I have some mind control power, and I have engaged these men – they are getting the money and I am enjoying.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda recalled how, as early as 1969, when his temple in Los Angeles had purchased a few cars and the number of devotees had begun increasing, the neighbors had become envious. Prabhupāda said that he had invited them to also come and live in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness community, but that their reply had always been no. Prabhupāda said that the more the opposition created turmoil, the more Kṛṣṇa consciousness would become famous. He also reasoned that people were reacting to his very strong preaching.\n“I condemn everyone,” he said, “that they are all dogs and hogs. And the United Nations I called a pack of barking dogs. It’s a fact. And in Chicago I said, ‘All women, you cannot have freedom.’ So I became a subject of great criticism.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda concluded his meeting with Rāmeśvara by saying that the devotees should be very alert and intelligently defend the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement; but they should also understand that a higher principle was operating This opposition indicated the genuineness of ISKCON. Even Kṛṣṇa Himself was sometimes the center of calamitous activities, such as when He fought with Kāliya and other enemies or when, as an infant, He fell into the Yamunā river.\n“This is the beauty of Vṛndāvana,” said Prabhupāda. “When Kṛṣṇa entered the Yamunā to fight with Kāliya it was not at all good news for mother Yaśodā, Nanda, the friends and family. Not at all. Their life was lost. But still Kṛṣṇa was the center. This is Vṛndāvana. In everything Kṛṣṇa is in the center. So our situation is just like that. They are making bad propaganda against Kṛṣṇa – this is the opposition – but I am happy that Kṛṣṇa is the center. That’s all. This is the beauty of this movement. Although we are put into some difficulty, yet the center is Kṛṣṇa.”\nEarly on the morning of January 11 Śrīla Prabhupāda embarked on the twenty-four-hour-plus train ride from Bombay to Allahabad. He was sharing his first-class compartment with Rāmeśvara Swami, Jagadīśa, and Hari-śauri, and even as the train pulled out of the station, Prabhupāda was preaching.\nRāmeśvara mentioned a radio show he had recently been on in California, where a Lutheran minister had said Kṛṣṇa was a sex symbol because He had so many wives andgopīs.\n“Even taking it that Kṛṣṇa is after sex,” said Prabhupāda, “then if sex is bad, why are they after sex?”\n“He says that sex is not for God,” Rāmeśvara replied. Śrīla Prabhupāda was sitting on one side of the compartment, and his disciples sat facing him. The loud rattling of the train cars on the rails made conversation sometimes difficult.\n“If sex is not there in God,” said Prabhupāda, “then how has it come? God created everything. So God did not create sex?” Śrīla Prabhupāda explained that sex exists both in the material world and in the spiritual, material sex enjoyment being a perversion of the original, pure sex that exists in the Supreme. Kṛṣṇa’s sexual enjoyment, therefore, is not at all like material sex; it is the exact opposite, in fact, inasmuch as the reality is the opposite of its reflection.\n“You do not understand how to face the opposing party,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. He was in an animated, argumentative mood, enthusiastic to show his disciples how to defeat the opposition. He had sometimes described his own spiritual master assiṁha(“lion”)-guru,and they now saw him in a similar fighting spirit. “The more opposition there will be,” he said, “the more we have to defend.”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Rāmeśvara asked, “should we be thinking in our minds that one day the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will have to manage the cities and the nations of the world?”\n“Oh, yes,” Prabhupāda replied.\nRāmeśvara asked how the devotees could accomplish such a huge, ambitious project. The management would be simplified, Prabhupāda explained, since the citizens would live a pure, natural life. Thus the burdensome, sinful aspects of godless government would become unnecessary, and so many complex problems would be solved. He gave the example of self-sufficient agrarian communities where men earn their livelihood locally. But only by education and by experiencing the higher taste of Kṛṣṇa conscious pleasure, he said, could the masses become satisfied with simple living.\nRāmeśvara asked if America would become Kṛṣṇa conscious by a minority of Kṛṣṇa conscious persons becoming powerful in government, while the masses remained askarmīs.\n“No,” Prabhupāda replied. “You can introduce Kṛṣṇa consciousness in such a way that they will become devotees. Suppose in big, big factories we shall introduce thisprasādamdistribution and chanting. They will immediately become devotees. Their hearts will be cleansed:ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.”\n“But will it be like Russia,” pursued Rāmeśvara, “where there is only a small group of people who are in control?”\n“No, it is not like that. The quality of the people will be changed.”\n“So that means only when the whole mass of population becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious,” Rāmeśvara suggested, “then there will be Kṛṣṇa conscious government.”\n“No,” Prabhupāda corrected. “You can have government when you are in minority. But the mass of people, on account of this quality, they have to see the example.”\nIn one sense these were not immediate concerns – how the devotees would manage the whole world – since the devotees’ political influence was at present insignificant. But by answering these questions, Prabhupāda was establishing future goals and tactics for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Rāmeśvara Swami, as both a practical manager and a visionary, wanted to know exactly how Śrīla Prabhupāda saw the Kṛṣṇa conscious world of the future.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had the answers, but he indicated that social or political management would be done not by any new formalities but by pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by changing the hearts of the people through chanting, hearing, studying scripture – andthenorganizing things on the basic principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nAs the train passed beyond the heavily populated Bombay area and entered the countryside, Śrīla Prabhupāda looked out the window, appreciating the scenery. “We have come to the open field,” he said. “How it is nice. And as long as we were passing through the congested areas –  hellish, simply hellish. Now here is open space, how it is nice.”\n“Entering into a city is so imposing on your consciousness,” said Hari-śauri.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said, “at that point it is simply rubbish. All papers thrown here and there, and people living in hellish conditions. Now see here how it is open and pleasing. So organize these farm projects.”\nWhen Rāmeśvara pointed out that beginning a farm community required a great deal of capital, Prabhupāda simply replied that the devotees should show the example and that others would automatically follow the successful pattern. Rāmeśvara mentioned that in America, although the ISKCON temple presidents were eager to get as many people to join as possible, they found that most people were unable to come up to the required standard.\n“Therefore farm,” Prabhupāda said.\n“They have to be encouraged to have a little bit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in their own home,” Rāmeśvara suggested, “ – make their home a temple.”\nPrabhupāda disagreed. “No. Let them go to the farm, New Vrindaban.” If the people were disinclined to austerity, he said, then let them come to the farm with their wife and children and live comfortably in their own house. And on the farms they would find plenty of employment. More and more, Prabhupāda said, people would become jobless and would be obliged to take shelter of a Kṛṣṇa conscious farm community.\n“So we can expect,” said Hari-śauri, “that material conditions are going to become very much worse than at present?”\n“They may come or not,” said Prabhupāda. “We don’t care. Let us establish an ideal society.”\nAlthough Prabhupāda had left Bombay without taking breakfast, he continued speaking for four hours and then asked Hari-śauri to serve lunch. The other devotees left the compartment.\nHari-śauri carried all Prabhupāda’s personal effects in two small shoulder bags, one with three changes of clothing, the other with Prabhupāda’s plate, bowl, spoon,tiffin, tilaka,and mirror. With just these two bags, Prabhupāda was traveling all over the world. Although he was the head of a wealthy, international movement, he kept nothing for himself and traveled light. Whatever donations he collected, whatever profits came from the sale of his books, whatever properties he owned – everything was in the name of ISKCON. And yet when it came time to eat in the middle of that dusty train ride, his servant was able to produce silver bowls and a tray and an elegant vegetarian feast. Although Prabhupāda kept nothing for himself, by Kṛṣṇa’s arrangement he was well provided for.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda sat cross-legged on the train seat and pointed to what he wanted from the stainless steeltiffincompartments his servant placed before him. There weresabjīs, purīs,fruits, and sweets. After Śrīla Prabhupāda chose what he wanted and began to eat, he insisted that Hari-śauri also takeprasādam.When they finished, Hari-śauri distributed the remnants of Prabhupāda’s meal to the other devotees, and Prabhupāda lay down to rest.\nIn the afternoon, more devotees gathered in Prabhupāda’s small compartment, and he continued preaching, mostly in reply to points Rāmeśvara Swami raised.\n“In regard to brainwashing,” said Rāmeśvara, “they claim that our lifestyle tends to take the devotee and isolate him from the world.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “we hate to mix with you. No gentleman tries to mix with loafers. Crows will not like to live with the ducks and white swans, and white swans will not like to live with the crows. That is natural division. Birds of the same feather flock together.”\nRāmeśvara: “They have a list of five or six conditions, and they say if all these conditions are present, then it is a suitable atmosphere for brainwashing. They say we are imposing those conditions on our members.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. We are brainwashing from bad to good. That is our business. We are washing the brain from all rascaldom. Your brain is filled up with all rubbish things – meat-eating, illicit sex, gambling. So we are washing them.Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam. Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa kīrtanaḥ hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi. Abhadrāṇimeans ‘bad things.’ So the bad things should be washed. Don’t you cleanse your home? Don’t you cleanse your room? Is that brainwashing? So if you wash your room very clean, who blames you? But you are so rascal that you charge us, ‘Why are you washing away this garbage?’ We are washing out the garbage, and you are protesting. This is your intelligence. But intelligent men wash away the garbage. That is the law of civilization, to cleanse. That we are doing.\n“According to Vedic civilization you are actually untouchable. Now we have come to touch you. Therefore wash – first you must wash. According to Indian civilization the dog is untouchable, but he is your best friend. So you are untouchable. Therefore, we have to wash your brain. Unless your brain is washed, you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Man is known by his company. You sleep with dog, you eat with dog, your best friend is dog, so what you are? You must be washed, scrubbed.”\nRāmeśvara: “But this is their argument, that the standard in America is that you become learned in different fields – science, music, art, and literature. This standard of culture and education is coming from the idea of the Renaissance in Europe. But in our Hare Kṛṣṇa movement we are isolating ourselves from these things and simply reading one set of literature – Kṛṣṇa.”\nPrabhupāda: “This other is not culture. As soon as you change, that means it is not culture. It ismano-dharma,mental concoction. Yes, we want to stop your nonsense. That is our mission. Those who are intelligent, they have taken. And you also take.”\nRāmeśvara raised the objection that Kṛṣṇa conscious children are not prepared to go to public schools and universities, and Śrīla Prabhupāda replied that they were being saved.\n“But what if they want to change later in their life?” asked Rāmeśvara.\n“They have become Kṛṣṇa conscious from the very beginning,” Prabhupāda replied. “That is the perfection of life. They are perfect from the very beginning of their life. And you are going to school in the college, but you are becoming most uncivilized – like cats and dogs, becoming naked and having sex on the street. So what is the value of that education? Stop all these colleges and universities. As soon as they are stopped, it is better for human beings.”\nRāmeśvara: “They say that if we claim our members are gentlemen, they why is it that they go to the airport and bother so many people?”\nPrabhupāda: “They are not bothering. They are educating. When a thief is advised, ‘Kindly do not become a thief,’ he takes it as botheration. But it is good advice.”\nRāmeśvara: “They say it is invasion of privacy. Every man has the right to think the way he wants.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. Therefore I have got the right to think like this and sell books.”\nRāmeśvara: “So if I do not want to hear your philosophy, why do you impose it?”\nPrabhupāda: “It is not imposing. It is good philosophy. We are canvassing: ‘Take it. You will be benefited.’ And they are being benefited. Those who are reading, they are being benefited. And why are you advertising – big, big signboards: ‘Please come and purchase’? Hmm? Why are you imposing your so-called goodness on us? Why you are doing?”\nBack and forth the battle went, hour after hour, Rāmeśvara unleashing all the arguments against the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and Śrīla Prabhupāda defeating them. Prabhupāda called the arguments “childish” and “foolish,” and he strongly criticized the materialistic demeanor from which they sprang. Byśāstraand logic he proved that the nondevotee has no good qualities and is less than an animal because of his lack of God consciousness. Such a person, he said, was in no position to criticize, and such criticisms only showed ignorance of the real purpose of human life.\nThe train stopped in Manmad, Jalgaon, and Khandwa, as well as other small towns and junctions, and for Prabhupāda and his disciples the day passed quickly in discussion. Prabhupāda was absorbed in defending the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. He relished fighting on behalf of Lord Caitanya. He was speaking, of course, mainly for the benefit of his disciples, but beyond that, he was expressing his compassion for all beings and his dedication to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\n“They are spending so much for military strength,” Prabhupāda continued. “They are not performingyajña,so how will there be rainfall? There will be warfare, devastation. It is a most rubbish civilization. They are misleading everyone – soul killing. It is the blind leading the blind. Even when there is difficulty, we have to do this as Kṛṣṇa’s business. Let the dogs bark on. We don’t care. If we remain sincere to Kṛṣṇa, that is our victory. The external result is not so important. We have to act according to the direction of Kṛṣṇa.\n“Of course, we want to see good results, but even if there is no good result, we don’t mind. We must be sincere to Kṛṣṇa, that we have done our best without cheating. That is our duty. As servants, we shall not cheat the master – result or no result. The devotee is not sorry if there is no result: ‘Never mind.’ Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, ‘I have brought to Benares thehari-nāma,but here they are all Māyāvādīs. So if it is not accepted, all right. I shall take it back.’ But we must do our best canvassing work: ‘Please take it.’ That is our mission. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare … . ” Śrīla Prabhupāda’s speaking trailed off into chantingjapa.He would chant for a while and then bring up another point.\nRāmeśvara Swami continued to stir the controversies, anxious to fortify his own convictions and preaching ability by hearing directly from Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“Very often,” Rāmeśvara said, “they will say, ‘It is not religion that we are concerned with, but it is brainwashing and mind control. You are chanting so many hours a day… ’ ”\n“What is it to you!” Prabhupāda interrupted sharply. “That is my business. Why do you bother yourself?”\nRāmeśvara: “But you are not giving these young people a chance to think when they chant for so many hours.”\nPrabhupāda: “You are thieves. You are coming to kidnap. Why shall I give you a chance? They are chanting, but you are charging brainwash. You ask them don’t chant – that is your business. But that you cannot do.”\nRāmeśvara: “But they say that takes away freedom to think.”\nPrabhupāda: “That is controversy. But you want to take his freedom, and still you are accusing us.”\nPrabhupāda said that first there should be a test of what is genuine religion. “We say,” said Prabhupāda, “that the law given by God is religion. And it does not matter what name is given to God. If we say ‘Kṛṣṇa,’ that does not mean that He is not God. So before there is a challenge to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there should be an assembly discussion and decision as to what is genuine religion. We say that God is one, and whatever He has given as law, that is religion.”\nRāmeśvara: “But the Christians say that according to the Bible, if God wanted us to believe in Kṛṣṇa, He would have told us on Mount Sinai, and He would have told us through Jesus Christ. Jesus said, ‘I am the only way.’ ”\nPrabhupāda: “That’s all right. But Jesus Christ did not explain more to you because you are rascals. You cannot follow even his one instruction, ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ It is not the foolishness of Jesus Christ. But because you are so rascal, you cannot understand him. Therefore he avoided you rascals. Because whatever he said, you cannot follow. So what you will understand? Therefore he stopped speaking.”\nRāmeśvara: “They also say that you are ruining family life.”\nPrabhupāda: “That’s all right. We are entering Kṛṣṇa’s family.”\nHari-śauri: “But if you are actually followers of God, why are you breaking up the families? Shouldn’t you have love for everyone?”\nRāmeśvara: “One of the commandments is that one shall honor thy father and mother.”\nPrabhupāda replied that a devotee loves his mother and father by teaching them Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nHari-śauri: “My mother testified to that. When I was at home she said I was impossible to live with. When she saw me afterwards, I was very nice.”\nPrabhupāda: “Many. Hayagrīva’s father and mother also.”\nRāmeśvara: “My parents think like that too. I could have no relationship with them before, but now that I am a devotee, I actually want to help them.”\nPrabhupāda: “There are so many fathers and mothers who appreciate. None of our disciples are disrespectful to mother and father. Why? I never said you become disrespectful to your father and mother. At Brahmānanda’s initiation, his mother was standing there and I instructed Brahmānanda, ‘Take the dust of your mother’s feet first, then you offer me obeisances.’ So first of all he offered his obeisances to his mother. I told him, ‘You have got good mother. Otherwise, how she has got a son like you?’ I always say like that. I never say disrespect. In a particular case, if the father and mother are demons, he must give up their association. But we never said break up the family.”\nRāmeśvara: “I think we’ve used up all our arguments.”\nPrabhupāda (still eager to argue): “First of all you said that we are depriving of food. Where is this?”\nRāmeśvara: “Yes, this is their argument, that we only let devotees eat twice a day. And there is no meat and very little protein.”\nPrabhupāda: “That depends on him. If he likes to eat that kind of food, you have no right to force. Thenyouare turning to force. There are different persons, and they like different types of food. If he likes twice a day, why do you insist thrice? That is his choice.”\nRāmeśvara: “And sleeping only four or five hours – very little.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, because it is a waste of time.”\nRāmeśvara: “But this makes his mind very weak.”\nPrabhupāda: “You rascal! You have nothing to do –yousleep! Napoleon used to sleep for one hour, two hours – he was such a busy man. So they are so busy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Every great man does not sleep very much. Sleeping is simply a waste of time. If he does not sleep more, it is a sign of greatness.”\nWhen Rāmeśvara Swami argued that the opposition has psychologists to testify against us, Prabhupāda replied, “We have got our psychologists.”\nAfter talking all afternoon and into the night, Prabhupāda told the devotees to rest. At ten P.M. he lay down, and Hari-śauri massaged his legs. “Actually,” Śrīla Prabhupāda concluded, “their arguments are not very sound. Therefore it is simply a plan of Kṛṣṇa’s to help give us some prominence. It will make us more well known.” Opposition, he said, was just an opportunity to preach. But to deal properly with the legal cases and other serious opposition, the devotees would have to knowhowto preach. And they would have to be spiritually strong. He was readying his men, speaking to them day and night on the twenty-four-hour train ride to Allahabad.\nAllahabadJanuary 12They arrived at nine A.M., and half a dozen of Śrīla Prabhupāda’ssannyāsīdisciples, along with akīrtanaparty of about fifty devotees, were there to greet him. They had brought Prabhupāda’s car down from Delhi, and he rode the short distance from the station to the Melā site. Thousands of pilgrims, on foot and in rickshas, crowded the streets, making Prabhupāda’s progress by car slow. Finally the road ended, but the traffic continued onto the sandy flats surrounding the Triveṇī (confluence of the rivers Sarasvatī, Gaṅgā, and Yamunā). Here, within a few days, a city of tents had sprung up. Two million had camped already, with millions more arriving daily. Every spiritual group in India had its bamboo-fenced compound of tents.\nAs the car inched along, Prabhupāda smiled to see a group of his disciples strolling among the camps and performinghari-nāma kīrtana.But not until he passed through the congested main area of camps to the far end of the Triveṇī did he reach the ISKCON camp. The ISKCON tents, most of which had been erected about half an hour before Śrīla Prabhupāda’s arrival, were located near a railway bridge on an island called Gaṅgādvīpa; and the Triveṇī bathing area was a twenty-minute walk away. The festival organizers had provided simple outdoor toilets, water taps, and a “kitchen,” consisting of a cloth partition, a hole in the ground, and some bricks.\nIt was, as Śrīla Prabhupāda had expected, the usual Kumbha-melā austerity, but he was displeased with the camp’s remote location. And when he heard that the electric lines did not reach their area, he became even more displeased. How could people come to the program in the evening if there were no lights? He called for Bhāgavata and Gurudāsa, who were in charge of organizing the ISKCON camp.\n“Who got this land?” he yelled.\n“When I got here,” said Bhāgavata, “it was an empty field. They told me, ‘We are putting you on this island. The governor is there, Kalapatri Mahārāja is there, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is there.’ I thought you were there with all the leading personalities.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda laughed. “You are inexperienced, so they cheated you. All right, you did not know.”\nBut later, when he heard that Bhāgavata and Gurudāsa had not obtained enough food for mass distribution, he became angry. Again he called for Bhāgavata.\n“Why is there noprasādamdistribution tonight?” he demanded.\n“Well, Prabhupāda,” Bhāgavata stuttered, “I don’t know. They didn’t buy any food.”\n“Why have they not bought?” Prabhupāda was angry. “What is the matter with you? You Americans are big spenders – simply wasting money. You have no stock of food. Why you did not stock rice,dāl,and wheat? Why you have no stock? What is the matter with you? You have no brain. You spend five rupees’ cab fare going, five rupees’ cab fare coming back, and you buy one rupee of rice. This is your mentality. You are nonsense! Every time you need something you go to the store and buy it. You don’t know how to buy sufficiently one time and then use it. You cannot think like that. And why have you made this location under the elevated train? Why have you done this wrong? The train is making noise. Thispaṇḍālis a failure. Food is not being distributed.” After twenty minutes of reprimanding, Prabhupāda dismissed Bhāgavata.\nA little later Prabhupāda called for Bhāgavata again. “Bhāgavata Mahārāja,” he began, although Bhāgavata was not asannyāsī,“if you can just get the lights on, then you will be doing good. Can you do that?” Bhāgavata said he could, and by that night the ISKCON camp had lights, although, as at all the other camps, the power was frequently shut off.\nOnly a few people visited the ISKCONpaṇḍālthe first night; the weather was cold, damp, and windy. Śrīla Prabhupāda chose to sit up all night at his desk rather than lie in the cold bed. Wearing all his clothes – sweaters, a hooded coat, acādara,and gloves – he sat at his desk in the darkness. A kerosene heater did little to drive the chill from the tent. Rāmeśvara Swami sat up much of the night too, relighting the heater’s pilot light, which blew out every few minutes as the wind swept through the tent.\nBy morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda had a bad cold with runny nose and eyes. He did not go to the river for bathing but used the icy water from the pump next to his tent. His hands and feet were swollen, something that had happened to him before during illness. When the devotees suggested he not stay at the camp, Prabhupāda insisted; he wanted to preach. People were beginning to discover his location and come to see him, so he wanted to stay and preach. Kumbha-melā, he said, was an opportunity for the devotees to preach, not merely to bathe in the Gaṅgā.\nThe devotees crowded into Śrīla Prabhupāda’s tent forguru-pūjāandŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamclass. They had no garland for him, but he said nothing about it. By the time he had ended his short lecture, the sun had risen. He asked Hari-śauri to put the cot outdoors, where he rested and later took massage in the sunshine.\nDuring his massage, Prabhupāda looked over at the railroad bridge and said that he remembered this bridge from his former days in Allahabad. He said that his father had been cremated under the bridge on the same island of Gaṅgādvīpa in 1930.\nThat afternoon, a group of devotees arrived from Māyāpur, and some of them immediately complained to Prabhupāda about how poorly managed the ISKCONpaṇḍālseemed to be. Prabhupāda asked them to try to salvage the program by distributing as many books as possible, so the devotees began distributing Hindi editions of Prabhupāda’s books.\nThe devotees took their chanting and book distributing down the main road, where they came upon the camps of different Śaivites, who sat around their fires wearing onlykaupīnas(loincloths). Many of them, their hair matted, their bodies covered with ashes, were puffing heavily on hashish inchilampipes. Nearby, on the other side of the road, were the camps of Vaiṣṇavas from the Rāmānujasampradāya.Though they were alsotyāgīs(renunciates), and their appearance was similar to the Śaivites’, they were more friendly; they were glad to see the devotees and shouted out, “Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma.”\nThe devotees were amazed by the piety of the millions of pilgrims. On seeing thekīrtanaparty approach, many people offered prostrated obeisances. Others rolled on the ground, or picked up dust where the devotees had walked and put it in their mouths. And although many of the pilgrims were poor, they came forward and dropped at least a few paisa into the pot carried by one of the devotees. Anyone who gave a rupee would receive a book, and the books became so popular that people would come and ask for them by name. Some people threw money, and thesannyāsīswould catch it in their topcloths, which they would hold out like aprons. By the end of the day, the devotees had distributed about seven thousand pieces of literature.\nOn the second night, Śrīla Prabhupāda again sat up, while Rāmeśvara Swami tried futilely to keep the heater going. Hari-śauri had placed Śrīla Prabhupāda’s dictating equipment on the desk, but Prabhupāda did not touch it.\nJanuary 14, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s third day in Allahabad, was the first day of Kumbha-melā bathing and would be a special opportunity for book distribution. An ISKCON chanting party of about fifty men and several Indiangurukulaboys was very well received as they traveled throughout the Melā area. At one-thirty P.M., the time of auspicious bathing, thekīrtanaparty made its way to the Triveṇī. As they approached, the police cleared a path for them all the way to the water. By evening they had distributed eight thousand books, and for the first time since they had arrived, Prabhupāda expressed his pleasure at their success. He ordered some of thesannyāsīsto stay at the Melā until all the books were distributed.\nThe next morning, despite ill health, Prabhupāda took a walk. Surrounded by about twenty-five disciples, he walked slowly. Although he was a small figure surrounded by tallsannyāsīs,the Kumbha-melā pilgrims were able to easily recognize his preeminent position, and they would break through the ranks of devotees and offerdaṇḍavatsbefore him. When Prabhupāda saw people approaching, he would stop walking and let them touch his feet, despite the objections of his disciples. He was already sick, and he had explained in his books that a devotee can become ill if sinful people touch his feet. Still, he did not object.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was scheduled to stay at the Melā through January 21, but his disciples pressed him to go to a place more suitable for his health. Rarely had any of them seen him so sick, and they worried. “But my only ambition,” said Prabhupāda, “is that so many people can become enlightened.”\nWord was beginning to circulate that Śrīla Prabhupāda, theguruof the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, was staying in a camp on Gaṅgādvīpa, and more people were starting to come to see him. He said that the people coming to the Kumbha-melā were expecting all the holy men and spiritual teachers of India to be there, so he felt obligated to stay until the 2lst.\nRāmeśvara Swami tried to advise Prabhupāda. “Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said, “there is something much more important than your givingdarśanato these people, and that is your writing of your books. Only a few thousand people are going to see you here, but if you go on writing, we will distribute your books by the millions. Then millions of people will have yourdarśana.There is no facility for writing here. The climate is too cold, and your health is weak. Let’s go on to Bhubaneswar, where it’s warm and they have healthy water.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had previously mentioned Bhubaneswar because of the water of Bindu-sarovara, which was supposed to have special medicinal properties. And he liked the argument that his writing was more important than his remaining in Allahabad to benefit a few thousand pilgrims. For the devotees on his personal staff – his secretary, servant, and cook – to see Prabhupāda going through such austerities while suffering ill health was very painful.\nFinally Prabhupāda agreed to go. He called in Gurudāsa and Bhāgavata and gave them a final verbal chastising for the mismanagedpaṇḍāl.Then, on the afternoon of the 15th, he prepared to leave.\nRāmeśvara Swami and Gurudāsa went to the train station to purchase tickets, but they found that no seats would be available for weeks. Seeking special consideration, they visited the local railway office, a lavishly appointed, remodeled railway car. There they happened to meet their friend from Bombay, Mr. Gupta, and they told him of Prabhupāda’s illness and of his desire to leave at once for Calcutta.\nMr. Gupta phoned Bombay and arranged for a first-class coach to be added to a train coming from Bombay to Allahabad. The devotees profusely thanked Mr. Gupta, who began proposing that Śrīla Prabhupāda travel throughout India in a royal car like the one they were in. The devotees discussed with him about how they might buy or lease such a car, and it seemed an interesting possibility. But the immediate miracle had been arranged: a coach to take Prabhupāda out of the crowded throngs of Kumbha-melā to Calcutta.\nAfter a difficult car ride, inching along through the crowds from the Triveṇī to the train station, Prabhupāda and his party finally arrived at the railway station, where government men helped him and his disciples with their luggage and saw to their comfort. From the devotees’ point of view, this was the proper respect for a pure devotee of the Lord, the most important person in the world; yet such treatment was rare. Śrīla Prabhupāda was pleased, and he asked his secretary to type a letter, thanking Mr. Gupta, who was caring for Prabhupāda “just like a father looking after a son.” He invited Mr. Gupta and his family to attend the upcoming Gaura-pūrṇimā festival in Māyāpur.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda asked to hear the reviews of his books, as published inThe Krishna Consciousness Movement Is Authorized.His secretary read one review after another – professors praising Prabhupāda’s work and requesting him to go on producing such valuable books. After hearing the reviews, Prabhupāda lay down to rest. “The pen is mightier than the sword!” Rāmeśvara Swami declared.\n“Yes,” Śrīla Prabhupāda answered. “It is a revolution. That is what I thought as I wrote on and on. The Communists have changed the lives of people throughout the world by their empty literature and false promises. Why not a revolution started on the basis of the absolute knowledge?”\nJanuary 18, 1977After the intense cold of Kumbha-melā, Prabhupāda had recuperated a couple of days in Calcutta. His head cold had gone away, but the swelling in his hands and feet persisted, as did other maladies. Externally, he was diabetic and suffered from poor digestion, as well as from the general dwindling of physical powers common to an eighty-one-year-old body. His condition was not suited for continual travel, hard work, frequent lectures, and taxing management.\nYet Prabhupāda was transcendental to his apparent material condition. Although sometimes he would inquire about cures, mostly he was callous toward his poor health. Even after receiving a doctor’s advice or concluding himself what was good for his health, he would often ignore it in favor of what he thought was best for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Previously, in Vṛndāvana he had felt better by drinking the fresh well water, so he thought he might also get relief by drinking the water of the famous Bindu-sarovara near Bhubaneswar. Besides, ISKCON had recently acquired a small donated plot of land outside the city, and Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Oriyan disciple Gaura-govinda Swami had gone there, constructed two simple dwellings, and was making plans to build a temple.\nThe train journey from Calcutta to Bhubaneswar was twelve hours, another opportunity for Rāmeśvara Swami to probe. His thirty-day assignment as Prabhupāda’s secretary was almost over, and then he would return to Los Angeles and his American BBT duties. He had come to India set on inquiring from Prabhupāda about whether there would be world war and, if so, how book distribution would continue and how in the future a new world order of Kṛṣṇa consciousness would be introduced. Prabhupāda had answered many of his questions, but there were always more.\nThe Puri Express left Calcutta around ten P.M. After taking a massage, Śrīla Prabhupāda stretched out on the lower bunk to rest, and Hari-śauri and Rāmeśvara took the two bunks opposite him. Around midnight Prabhupāda turned on his light, sat up, and began chanting softly on his beads. Within a few minutes, Rāmeśvara awoke and, seeing his spiritual master sitting up, paid obeisances and also sat up, waiting expectantly. Immediately Prabhupāda began to speak about the inevitability of war between Russia and America. Even if America took to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the war would be inevitable – the only way to stop the godlessness of Communism. When Rāmeśvara asked if that war would be within his lifetime, Prabhupāda said it was difficult to say. It depended, he said, on the devotees’ distribution of books andBack to Godheadmagazines. Although in Russia the government tried to strictly control all literature, Kṛṣṇa conscious books were entering nonetheless and were immediately becoming popular. The Communist leaders were becoming fearful, but they also had some respect for Indian culture. Prabhupāda said that by increasing book distribution, America, and thereafter the whole world, would become Kṛṣṇa conscious.\n“So you have to push on more and more,” he said. “This opposition, brainwashing charges, means they are recognizing this as a culture. They may like it or not, but they recognize it as something permanent.”\nPrabhupāda said he had no political aim, but he knew that Indian culture coupled with American money could save the world. “You must think in terms of the whole world,” he said. “Not just one nation. That is our preaching. That is the duty of the G.B.C.”\nThe talk went on for more than two hours, and Rāmeśvara felt completely satisfied by the intimate instructions. Although he had once before asked some of the same questions about book distribution and the war, Prabhupāda had chosen not to answer. But now he revealed some of his thoughts, just as a father instructing a trustworthy son.\nThe second small building, about twenty-five feet from Prabhupāda’s hut, was a tiny temporary temple room. A shabby canvas roof spanned the open area between the two buildings, and Prabhupāda’svyāsāsanawas beneath this, arranged so he could lecture at outdoor gatherings. Two rented tents also stood on the land, to accommodate visiting devotees during Prabhupāda’s stay. Prabhupāda’s outdoor toilet facilities, about twenty-five feet behind his hut, consisted of a latrine and a separate area for bathing.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda did not mind the primitive facilities; in fact, he liked them. Although he was ill and for personal comfort could have been residing in his choice of comfortable buildings in the West – a manor in London, a castle in Paris, a penthouse apartment in New York City – he felt perfectly at home and happy living in a primitive mud-and-thatch hut on a secluded patch of land in the dust of Orissa.\nSitting on the outdoorvyāsāsana,Prabhupāda spoke to a small gathering of devotees and some local villagers. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he said, had two favorite places: Bengal and Orissa. And in Orissa (Jagannātha Purī) He spent the last eighteen years of His life. He went to Vṛndāvana and South India but then returned here to stay with His personal associates, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, and Śikhi Māhiti. Prabhupāda quoted a scriptural reference indicating that the spiritual movement for this age will begin from Utkala, or Orissa. Śrīla Prabhupāda said Orissa was very special to the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, and his own Guru Mahārāja was also born here, at Purī. “Now we have got a little place here,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if it takes time, but slowly but surely we can develop this center. Especially since Bhubaneswar is going to be the capital of Orissa. In the future many tourists will come to see other attractions of Orissa. Now it is up to the Oriyans to develop this idea.”\nPrabhupāda spoke with Gaura-govinda Swami and told him to begin advertising – private meetings in the afternoon and a regular lecture-kīrtana-prasādamprogram at night. That evening very few visitors came. ISKCON had done little preaching in Orissa, and Prabhupāda was not as well known. Mostly local farmers, villagers, and poor children came –  for the freeprasādam.Prabhupāda told the audience that he could speak in three languages – English, Bengali, and Hindi – but not Oriya. He therefore decided to speak in English and have Gaura-govinda translate. He would speak a few sentences and then pause while Gaura-govinda gave the Oriya.\n“In this material world,” said Prabhupāda during his evening lecture, “always the attempt is to defy the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment the so-called scientists’ only business is how to defy the supremacy of God. Naturally this movement has to face many impediments, because at the present moment the whole world is practically godless. Even in our country, in India, whereBhagavad-gītāwas spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa – even here the same attempt is going on. Big, big scholars, big, big politicians, they takeBhagavad-gītāin their hand to show that they are great authorities inBhagavad-gītā.But they are presenting commentation just to defy Kṛṣṇa.” Prabhupāda spoke for about ten minutes. There were no questions.\nBhubaneswar’s hot days and cool nights just suited Prabhupāda. After resting for a few hours, he rose and began translatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.It was the first time he had done so since leaving Bombay for Kumbha-melā. He was nearing the end of the Ninth Canto.\nGaura-govinda Mahārāja had scheduled a cornerstone-laying ceremony for a new temple on February 2, the appearance day of Lord Nityānanda. Prabhupāda agreed to stay until then and leave the next morning.\nRāmeśvara Swami, Gargamuni Swami, and Bhavānanda Goswami were sitting with Śrīla Prabhupāda in his hut discussing deprogramming cases with him. They were saying that these enemies of ISKCON were so fanatical that for Śrīla Prabhupāda to go to America would be dangerous. Śrīla Prabhupāda interrupted, however, changing the subject. “Our immediate problem,” he said,“is toward my health. I am not digesting food. Therefore there is some swelling in the hands and the legs.”\n“Is it affecting your translation work?” asked Rāmeśvara Swami.\n“That it has not affected,” said Prabhupāda. “It is going on. I have translated seventeen volumes. That may not be affected.” He reached over and turned on the dictating machine, and they heard a few seconds of his most recent dictation from the twenty-fourth chapter of the Ninth Canto.\n“We know you have a very low opinion of doctors,” said Rāmeśvara Swami.\n“I wish to die without a doctor,” Prabhupāda said. “I may be seriously ill, but don’t call a doctor. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don’t be disturbed. Everyone has to die. Let us die peacefully, without doctor. All this medicine, injections, and prohibitions, this, that. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and depend on Kṛṣṇa.Nārtasya cāgadam udanvati …that is Prahlāda Mahārāja’s verse. Find out this – Seventh Canto.” Hari-śauri reached to Prabhupāda’s bookcase for the Seventh Canto, Volume Two, ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Within a few moments he found the verse and read aloud:\n“These are facts,” said Prabhupāda.\n“That’s ultimately,” said Gargamuni Swami. “But maybe we could give you some temporary relief. Because when you are ill, we feel – ”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda conceded. “But no severe treatment should be accepted. Better not to take. Better to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Bhavānanda. “In the past, when your health was not good, they have begun chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa in all the temples around the world – a special additionalkīrtana.Perhaps we could institute that.”\n“No,” said Prabhupāda, “not for my health. You do yourkīrtanaordinary. That first stroke on Second Avenue, that was almost fatal. You were present, I think?” Prabhupāda turned to Gargamuni, and they reminisced about the stroke in 1967.\nHari-śauri said a homeopathic doctor had just prescribed some special medicine, and Prabhupāda agreed to try it. Gargamuni said that his father used to have a similar swelling, but his had been due to diabetes. “I have diabetes,” said Prabhupāda. Gargamuni Swami said his father used to give himself an insulin injection every morning. “There are many gentlemen who take insulin at least once a day,” said Prabhupāda, although he obviously had no intentions of doing so.\nPrabhupāda’s main health program was his diet, but even in that he was not very strict. An Indian cook named Shantilal was present in Bhubaneswar, and he used a lot of spices andgheein cooking for Gargamuni Swami and his men. Sometimes Prabhupāda would ask for some of what Shantilal had cooked, and this greatly disturbed Prabhupāda’s servants and cooks, although they could do nothing about it. Gargamuni had also been ill recently, and when Prabhupāda first saw him with his cook Shantilal, he had said, “I thought you were sick.”\n“Yes,” Gargamuni had replied, “but still I have to eat. Śrīla Prabhupāda, you are eating very simply. You are not eating spiced food?”\n“Sometimes I also have to have spices,” Prabhupāda replied. “Otherwise there is no taste. And without that taste, what is the use of life?” Then in a joking spirit Prabhupāda and Gargamuni Swami commiserated, saying they were not going to stop eating tastyprasādam.\n“We’d rather die,” laughed Gargamuni Swami, and Prabhupāda also laughed.\n“You have mentioned several times,” he began, “that there is a conflict which is inevitable between Russia and America.”\n“No,” said Prabhupāda. “If they understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness, both of them, then there will be no conflict. Now we are publishing in Russian.”\nWhen Rāmeśvara asked what would happen if many cities were bombed, Prabhupāda said that people would come to their senses and adopt a simpler, agrarian life, just as the ISKCON farm communities were demonstrating. “That will be a good lesson for them,” said Prabhupāda.\n“So is this conflict part of the spreading of Kṛṣṇa consciousness?”\n“Oh, yes.Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya caduṣkṛtām.*To conflict means to finish their sinful activities – finished. Stop it.”\n“So after the conflict there will be an opportunity to influence people?”\n“We shall take every opportunity,” said Prabhupāda. “We are the best opportunists.Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇa.This isanukūla –favorable for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness – and we shall immediately accept it. It doesn’t matter what it is. We do not depend on the public opinion, that this is good or this is bad. Good means if it is favorable for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nRāmeśvara said that it seemed the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement would have to grow much more before it could actually be as influential as Prabhupāda was indicating\n“It will grow,” said Prabhupāda. “It is growing. Simply our workers should be very sincere and strict, and it will grow. Nobody can object. That’s a fact. Simply we have to be very strict and sincere, and nobody can check.”\n“We will be the only ones who have any vision of what to do after the war,” said Rāmeśvara.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “We have got clear vision. We are not putting any theory. We are always presenting fact, and that is materializing. Just like we started our farm communities. It is materializing gradually. It is not yet fully organized. Still there is hope that it will give peace to the people. There is sufficient hope.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda opened his eyes widely in disbelief. “What is this?” he said. “You are from India, and you do not know what is God? This is the degradation of Kali-yuga.” Śrīla Prabhupāda continued his sharp criticism and then explained that Indians have the special benefit of Vedic literature and culture; therefore, every Indian should know God.\nPrabhupāda gave his first public lecture the next evening, and about 150 people attended. He began his lecture, “Last night some gentleman questioned, ‘What is God?’ ” Śrīla Prabhupāda explained that Śrī Bhagavān personally appears in “our country,” Bhārata-varṣa, and leaves His instructions, which have been accepted by theācāryas.India, Prabhupāda explained, is especially favored, since God personally incarnates there and imparts His instructions. “But at the present moment,” Prabhupāda continued, “our young men are inquiring, ‘What is God?’ So why has this happened? It has happened because we are making progress toward animal civilization.”\nAnyone with a bodily conception of the self, Prabhupāda said – anyone thinking of his identity in relation to family, country, or race – was no better than a cow or an ass, according to Vedicśāstra.He repeatedly warned that Indians should be careful of sinking to the position of having to ask what is God. Unfortunately, when he called for questions after his lecture, it was the same thing.\n“I want to know the meaning of the wordKṛṣṇa,” a man asked.\n“You do not know what is the meaning ofKṛṣṇa?” Prabhupāda retorted. “You do not know?”\nThe man said something in Oriya and then said in English, “The etymological meaning.”\n“Kṛṣṇa,” said Prabhupāda, “means all-attractive.Kṛṣ, karṣati.Yes, Kṛṣṇa means the attractive, all-attractive. And besides that, you do not know Kṛṣṇa? That is the difficulty, that our people have become so degraded that they are asking what is God, what is Kṛṣṇa. Someone has studied the Seventh Canto ofRāmāyaṇa,but now he is asking, ‘Whose father is Sītā?’ So this is the position. We are born in the country where Kṛṣṇa spoke everything, and now we are asking, ‘What is the meaning ofKṛṣṇa?What is God?’ This is the position, very degraded position.”\nSeeing several men jogging, Prabhupāda commented that most people were hungry and poor while a few were living in big houses, overeating, and running to lose fat. “So he will educate the people,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “and after some time they will join the Naxalite movement and kill the rich man. No. Everyone should be engaged in working the land.” Prabhupāda said his ISKCON men should also work, because unless they were properly engaged they would gossip and fall victim to sex desire.\nEarly one morning Prabhupāda set out in his car for Purī, on the Bay of Bengal. He looked at several properties there, but either their locations were poor or the buildings were deteriorated, or both. Prabhupāda walked along the beach with his men, and the surf was pounding. “I was jumping here,” he laughed. “In 1920 or ’21 I came here. At that time I was married. I was married in 1918. I came after appearing for my B.A. examination. And because I was jubilant, I was jumping. When the waves came I was jumping. Now it is fifty-seven years after. They say we do not change bodies, but where is that body? Now I am walking with stick. Then I was jumping. I am still here. I remember. But the body has changed. What is the difficulty to understand? I am the same. Otherwise, how I am remembering all these things? But that body is now lost.Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.Why this simple philosophy these rascals cannot understand?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda stayed a day at the beachside Tourist Bungalow, and one of his Godbrothers, Śyāmasundara Brahmacārī, from the local Purusottama Gaudiya Math visited. After he left, Sri Sevasiva Rath, a member of thepūjārīcommittee of the Jagannātha temple, also came to visit. Prabhupāda spoke to him about the possibility of ISKCON devotees entering the Jagannātha temple. To bar the Western Vaiṣṇavas from entering the temple was prejudiced and ignorant. Since the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement were fully engaged in spiritual life, they should not be considered unfit simply because of their birth status or race. Sevasiva Rath was friendly and agreed with Śrīla Prabhupāda; he promised he would do what he could to help. He also told Prabhupāda about a book he had just published and invited him to attend a smallpaṇḍālmeeting the next evening, at which the book would be inaugurated. Prabhupāda agreed.\nLater, Prabhupāda was sitting on the veranda outside his room at the Tourist Bungalow. As he sat watching Shantilal preparing lunch in the back of Gargamuni’s van, he could smell the aromatic spices cooking in theghee.He called to Gargamuni Swami and asked that a plate of Shantilal’s cooking be brought to him. Soon Prabhupāda was enjoying a meal of rice,dāl, purīs,spicysabjīs,and chutney. He said that Shantilal cooked wonderfully and that all devotees in ISKCON should learn this art. If the meat-eaters could take suchprasādam,he said, they would give up their sinful habit.\nAs Prabhupāda sat in his hotel room that evening with a few disciples at his feet, he reminisced about how he had come to America in 1965 and had suffered two heart attacks at sea. “They say that anyone who gets a third heart attack,” said Prabhupāda, “they must expire. I had two attacks on the ship, and then in New York a third one – paralyzed. Left side was paralyzed. I do not know how I was saved. And one girl, that captain’s wife, she studied astrology. She said, ‘Swami, if you can survive your seventieth year, then you will live for one hundred years.’ ”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda and his disciples laughed.\n“So,” Prabhupāda continued, “somehow or other I have survived my seventieth year. I do not know whether … . They say I will live for a hundred years. But seventieth year was severe. Three heart attacks and paralysis. And I was without any family. At that time none of you were with me. I was alone. I wasn’t dependent on anyone. But on the ship I saw that Kṛṣṇa was going to save me. I was going for His mission.”\n“Because he is a rascal,” Prabhupāda explained, “therefore he is excommunicated. My Guru Mahārāja kicked him out. So what is the value of his testimony? That is natural that someone will go out and speak against us. These things will happen in preaching. You cannot expect very smooth path.” The devotees agreed, and someone added that one of Jesus’ closest disciples had betrayed him.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda compared the present trouble to the troubles he had encountered when he first came to America. He reminisced further about his near fatal illness in 1967 and his return to India, where he had recuperated. But even after returning to America, he commented, he had not been able to sleep at night because of a sound in his ear.\n“As long as the body will be there,” Prabhupāda said, “there will be so many troubles. Kṛṣṇa has advised that they will come and go. Don’t care for it.Āgamāpāyino ’nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata. So bodily troubles, mental troubles, and enemies – so many impediments will come. What can be done? We have to tolerate. That is the material world. We cannot expect smooth, very happy. That is not possible. Kṛṣṇa was advising that to Arjuna, what to speak of us. Kṛṣṇa never says, ‘I have made some magic. You will have nothing to suffer.’ He never gave Arjuna any tablet. So we have to follow that. The moderngurussay, ‘I will give you some magic ash. There will be no trouble.’ But Kṛṣṇa, what did He say? He said, ‘No, tolerate.’ He did not say, ‘You are ass. I will give you some ash.’ Neither did Arjuna ask, ‘Why do You ask me to fight? Give me some ash. I’ll throw it.’ He was not such a fool that he asked some magic from Kṛṣṇa to kill his enemies. Actually he fought. This isBhagavad-gītā.So face things as they are, and depend on Kṛṣṇa. That is our duty. Don’t expect any ash, miracle, magic.”\nSome of the devotees were already in the ocean, and when Prabhupāda reached the water’s edge, they all gathered around him. As the waves glided in and swirled around Prabhupāda’s feet, Hari-śauri scooped palmfuls of water and began to bathe Prabhupāda’s body – his arms, chest, and head – washing away the mustard seed oil he had applied during the massage. Soon other devotees began reverently splashing handfuls of water onto Prabhupāda’s body. Standing almost up to his knees in water, the bright sunshine illuminating his golden-hued body, Prabhupāda laughed as the devotees joined in.\nThe devotees realized that this pastime was just like anabhiṣeka,or bathing of the Deity, and when Gurukṛpā Swami began to sing the prayers for bathing the Deity –cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu –the other devotees joined in, singing and taking part in theabhiṣekaby the sea. Śrīla Prabhupāda enjoyed it, sometimes putting his head forward to indicate that he wanted water poured on his head, then closing his eyes as the devotees poured the water. When Prabhupāda lost his balance for a moment, Hari-śauri grabbed him. Prabhupāda’s feet had been sinking into the sand, and when he held one foot out it was muddy. As he wriggled his toes, a devotee poured water on the foot, washing it clean. Prabhupāda then bent over, put ocean water in his mouth, and spat it out. Only Gurukṛpā Swami was quick enough to catch some of the water and drink it.\nAs Prabhupāda allowed the devotees to participate in bathing and gently massaging him, the devotees were carried away by ecstatic feelings. After about ten minutes, Prabhupāda came out of the water, changed his clothes, and walked back to the hotel, where two devotees escorted him to a comfortable chair, sat him down, and carried him up to his room for his afternoon rest.\nIn the afternoon, Sevasiva Rath came again to see Prabhupāda, accompanied this time by another Purībrāhmaṇa.They gave Prabhupāda some Jagannāthaprasādamand sang theJagannāthāṣṭakam.In silent appreciation Prabhupāda listened as thebrāhmaṇassang the famous prayers with each verse endingjagannāthaḥ svāmī nayana-patha-gāmī bhavatu me(“O Lord of the universe, kindly be visible unto me.”) When the twobrāhmaṇasfinished singing, Prabhupāda said, “So these European and American Vaiṣṇavas, they are hankering afterjagannāthaḥ svāmī nayana-patha-gāmī bhavatu me.Now it is through your intervention that they may be able to see Jagannātha Svāmī. They are hankering like that– jagannāthaḥ svāmī nayana-patha-gāmī.”\nSevasiva Rath again expressed his sympathy about the devotees’ not entering Jagannātha’s temple. He also told Prabhupāda more about the book he had published, a compilation of select verses from Jagannātha dāsa’s translation of theŚrīmad-Bhāgavataminto Oriya. Sevasiva had also written some commentary, and his book was to be inaugurated at a function that evening. Prabhupāda again promised to attend and address Purī’sbrāhmaṇasand religionists.\nThat evening, Śrīla Prabhupāda was guest of honor at the outdoorpaṇḍālon the beach, and his disciples accompanied him to the stage with a rousingkīrtana.Prabhupāda took his seat. After thekīrtanaended, one of the managers of the Jagannātha temple came forward and garlanded Śrīla Prabhupāda. Sevasiva then announced, “We thank A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, who has been kind enough to grace this occasion wherein we have assembled this evening to pay our respectful homage to His Holiness Jagannātha dāsa Gosvāmī, who was a contemporary of Lord Caitanya.” Suddenly, about fivebrāhmaṇassitting on a platform rose and walked off the stage to join akīrtanaparty in front of an altar in a nearby field. It seemed strange to the devotees that these men had to leave just when Śrīla Prabhupāda was going to speak.\n“I thank you very much,” Śrīla Prabhupāda began, but then the sound system failed. Śrīla Prabhupāda paused, while one of his own disciples, an electrician, corrected the problem. Śrīla Prabhupāda resumed speaking, his voice amplified above the distraction of the nearbykīrtanas.\n“So in our humble way,” Prabhupāda was saying, “we are trying to introduce Jagannātha Svāmī’s culture. Jagannāthaḥ svāmī nayana-patha-gāmī bhavatu me.” Sevasiva had invited Prabhupāda explicitly to speak about his new book, and Prabhupāda had already mentioned privately to his disciples that these people were inviting him to serve their own purpose. But now Prabhupāda took the occasion to speak about Lord Jagannātha, rather than about the Oriyan Jagannātha dāsa. He had a special message in mind.\n“You will be very much pleased to know,” he continued, “that in the year 1967 I introduced Ratha-yātrā in San Francisco, and it has been going on continually for the last nine or ten years. And the government, they have fixed up a holiday for Ratha-yātrā. We have the twentieth of July as a government-fixed-up holiday for Ratha-yātrā. And people take part in the Ratha-yātrā. Not only my devotees, but even outsiders. Ten to twelve thousand people attend, and we distributeprasādamto all of them. They feel very much obliged. And the newspaper writes that people in general never felt such ecstasy as they are feeling in the Ratha-yātrā festival. The police say that the crowds in the Western countries, as soon as there is a big crowd, they create disturbance. But the police were surprised that this crowd is not a window-breaking crowd.\n“Next we introduced Ratha-yātrā in London. And in London, Trafalgar Square – it is the most famous square within the city – there is a big column called Nelson’s Column. Ourrathawas so high thatThe Guardiannewspaper criticized this Ratha-yātrā as a rival to Nelson’s Column. Next we introduced Ratha-yātrā in Philadelphia. And last year we introduced Ratha-yātrā in New York. And we also have Ratha-yātrā in Melbourne and Sydney and in Paris.\n“So in the Western countries Ratha-yātrā is being introduced one after another, and Jagannātha Svāmī is attracting the attention of the Western people.” Suddenly some of the men on the stage began talking loudly among themselves in Oriya. Prabhupāda stopped, turned, and said, “What is that?” The talking subsided, and he continued.\n“So people will come in your Jagannātha Purī now from all parts of the world. That is beneficial from various points of view. From the point of view of the tourist program, the government will benefit. When people are attracted to see Jagannātha Purī, Jagannātha Svāmī, that is good. But unfortunately you do not allow these foreigners to enter the temple. How it can be adjusted? This stumbling block should be dissolved, that you want Jagannātha Svāmī to be compact within your home and you do not expand the mercy of Jagannātha.\n“He isJagannātha.*He is not only just Purīnātha or Oriyanātha. He is Jagannātha. Kṛṣṇa declares in theBhagavad-gītā, bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram.That is the definition ofjagannātha – sarva-loka-maheśvaram.*So why you should deny the inhabitants ofsarva-lokathedarśanaof Jagannātha? Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never approved such things. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saidpṛthivīte ache yata nagarādi grāma / sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma.When the thing is being done and when they are eager to come here, why you should restrain? What is the cause? This is not very good.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued to argue that foreigners who had taken to Vaiṣṇavism should be allowed to enter the temple of Lord Jagannātha. Offenses to the Vaiṣṇavas, he said, were condemned by Lord Caitanya. Therefore, Prabhupāda declared, he had come to Purī specifically to request the leaders to remove this offensive restriction and be friendly to the foreign devotees. He invited Purī’s leaders to come and see the Jagannātha and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temples all over the world and see how the foreigners had actually become pure Vaiṣṇavas, strictly avoiding sinful life. “No illicit sex, no meat-eating, no fish-eating, no egg-eating, no intoxication, no gambling,” said Prabhupāda.\n“Why you should not receive them as Vaiṣṇava and give them proper reception? That is my request. I hope there are many learned scholars and devotees present here. They should endeavor to remove this restriction of shortsightedness, and let us combinedly work with Jagannātha to preach thebhakticult for the benefit of the whole world.”\nAs Prabhupāda finished his lecture, Hari-śauri leaned forward and asked Prabhupāda if he wanted to answer questions. But Sevasiva came quickly to Prabhupāda’s side and said, “No, don’t put their questions.” Sevasiva picked up the small paperback volume which was supposed to have been the topic of the evening’s presentation. “TheBhāgavataof Jagannātha,” said Sevasiva, and he handed it to Śrīla Prabhupāda, requesting him to now speak, as expected, about the merit of the book and its inauguration. Śrīla Prabhupāda looked indifferently at the small book in his hand. Speaking over the microphone he said, “So what shall I do? Of course, I do not know the Oriya language, but it is said that it isBhāgavataof Jagannātha. So it is inaugurated today.” Prabhupāda placed the book down and stood up to leave. The audience applauded.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then walked off across the sands in the dark, followed by his disciples, and entered a nearby Gaudiya Math temple, where the devotees heldkīrtana.They then went to another Gaudiya Math temple, Purusottama Math, and again heldkīrtana.\nDuring the chanting at Purusottama Math, Prabhupāda sat in a chair. When he was ready to leave, he began to stand, using his cane as a support, but suddenly, as he was about halfway up, he dropped down again onto the chair. Hari-śauri had to lift him to his feet by holding him under the arms. Prabhupāda said nothing, but walked slowly out of the hall and got into the car. Not everyone had noticed Prabhupāda’s momentary collapse, but Hari-śauri, on returning to his room, anxiously wrote of it in a letter to a Godbrother as “yet another sign that Śrīla Prabhupāda’s health is very quickly dwindling away.” Certainly none of the Purīpaṇḍitashad noticed any dwindling from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s presentation on behalf of Lord Jagannātha, Lord of the universe.\n“The first chapter, which has sixty-nine verses,” he began, “describes Mahārāja Parīkṣit’s eagerness to learn about the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and it also tells us how Kaṁsa killed the six sons of Devakī because of his fear of being killed by her eighth child. The Second Chapter contains forty-two verses …” Prabhupāda’s patient description of each of the ninety chapters was the epitome of faithful rendering ofparamparāknowledge – without concoction, interpretation, addition, or subtraction. Therefore, he spoke with the same full faith that the original speaker of theBhāgavatam,Śukadeva Gosvāmī, had spoken with five thousand years ago to Mahārāja Parīkṣit.\n“Simply by chanting or repeatingkṛṣṇa-kathā,” Prabhupāda was saying, “one is liberated from the contamination of Kali-yuga. This is the mission of Kṛṣṇa consciousness: to hear about Kṛṣṇa and thus be liberated from material bondage.” Sitting up on their blankets, the devotees listened; they would not return to sleep. It was an important, historic moment.\nThe Tenth Canto begins five thousand years ago, when the entire world was oppressed by demonic rulers, and Prabhupāda was comparing the situation then to the present situation. His words were faint, but not weak. He was unhesitating, sure. “Without reference to the supreme power of the Personality of Godhead,” Prabhupāda dictated, “demons assert themselves to be independent kings and presidents, and thus they create a disturbance by increasing their military power. When such disturbances are very prominent, Kṛṣṇa appears. At present also, various demonic states all over the world are increasing their military power in many ways, and the whole situation has become distressful. Therefore Kṛṣṇa has appeared by His name in the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, which will certainly diminish the burden of the world. Philosophers, religionists, and people in general must take to this movement very seriously, for man-made plans and devices will not help bring peace on earth.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was like a field general in his tent, and his disciples were like his infantry men. They knew they were hearing his battle strategies even before the information was disseminated through the chain of command. They were thrilled. With faith they heard that just as Kṛṣṇa had defeated the demonic rulers, so the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement would counteract the demonic culture of the present age.\nLater, on the morning walk, one of the devotees mentioned to Prabhupāda that they were planning to put his name on a sign on the door, saying that on January 30 at 2:50 A.M., Śrīla Prabhupāda began the Tenth Canto. Prabhupāda was pleasantly surprised that they had heard him.\n“Kṛṣṇa’s flute can be heard in the Tenth Canto,” said Prabhupāda, “and the chapters Twenty-nine through Thirty-four are the smiling face of Kṛṣṇa.”\n“It is true,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “but now it has only taken its roots. You have to water and protect it, then you will get fruit. You have to give it protection. People must hear about us by our books, and we have to talk about the books.”\n“So it is not that it will happen overnight?”\n“No,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Gradually it will grow. The seed is there. Now protect it by introducing more and more books in every house.”\nAgain, Prabhupāda referred to the upcoming New York court case. “At least tell them to read our books,” he said. “This is our statement. Our defense is that you first of all read these books and then give your statement. Finish this, and then give your judgment. Give them all these eighty-four books!”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda became excited by the thought of the judges and lawyers reading all his books. He was completely serious, and he insisted the devotees get the authorities to read the books as legal evidences. Śrīla Prabhupāda continued, “Kṛṣṇa says,sarva-dharmān parityajya,‘Surrender to Me and give up all other religion.’ Now the question may arise, ‘Why we shall surrender?’ Then you can argue and go on for three years. The whole thing will come out: What is God? What is creation? What is your position? Why you should surrender? And so on, and so on, so on. What do you think?”\n“Yes, we should introduce the books as much as possible,” said Satsvarūpa. “I’ll write a letter to New York and tell them to emphasize this.”\n“Bring all these books in the court,” Prabhupāda said. “One time in Calcutta there was a big lawyer named Mr. Ghosh. So on one case he brought so many books for argument. The judges were friends, so they very mildly criticized him, ‘Oh, Mr. Ghosh, you have brought the whole library?’ ‘Yes, my lord,’ said Mr. Ghosh, ‘just to teach you law.’ ” Śrīla Prabhupāda laughed and repeated, “ ‘Yes, my lord, just to teach you law.’ ”\nPrabhupāda wanted his disciples to apply the same logic in the New York case. If the judge objected and said, “Why have you brought so many books to bother me?” the devotees should reply, “You have to hear. It may take twelve years to hear, but you have to hear. This is the law.” It sounded difficult, but the devotees knew they would have to try. This was Śrīla Prabhupāda’s specific instruction for handling the case.\n“We have to say,” said Prabhupāda, “we never tried to brainwash. We have done exactly according tośāstra,authority. Here is the evidence. We have not manufactured anything. So they must read all the books. I think you should take defense in that way.”\n“Our defense statement is already written in your books,” said Hari-śauri. “Certain sections?” asked Satsvarūpa. “Or should we say that they have to read all the books?”\nPrabhupāda shouted, “All! Line to line. Our defense is eighty-four volumes.”\n“But they’ll say,” said Gurukṛpā Swami, “ ‘If we read all these books, we’ll become brainwashed too.’ ”\n“That is my duty,” said Prabhupāda, “ – you are trying to brainwash me, and I am trying to brainwash you. This is going on. That is the tussle. It is wrestling. You are trying your strength. I am trying my strength. Otherwise, where is there fight? You have got right to not agree with me. I have got right to not agree with you. Now let us settle.”\n“Why not?” questioned Prabhupāda. “This is the capital of Orissa. People are coming here. We have to have centers in every town. Even if it is not a big center, some have to work and stay here. Even if the people are coming every night only to eat thekicharī,that is also preaching.”\nOne of the devotees said that it was too far from town and that Orissa was too poor. A better idea might be to try to build a big temple in Jagannātha Purī. Śrīla Prabhupāda replied that to build in Jagannātha Purī was all right, but that Bhubaneswar was also important. Prabhupāda’s Oriyan disciple, Gaura-govinda Swami, told Prabhupāda that as soon as the annual India pilgrimage was over, all the devotees would leave, and he would be left alone with one or twobrahmacārīs.He was particularly suited to translating Prabhupāda’s books into Oriya, so he asked Prabhupāda to give him someone to help manage the center.\n“Where is the fat one?” asked Prabhupāda. “Bring him here.” And a devotee ran out to fetch Bhāgavata. At the time the devotee found him, Bhāgavata was sitting in the visitors’ tent, telling the other devotees about his plan to go to New York. When he heard Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted to see him, he assumed it was in connection with the cornerstone-laying ceremony, since he was in charge. But as soon as he entered Prabhupāda’s room he sensed something heavy was about to happen.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda smiled and asked Bhāgavata how he was.\n“I’m fine, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\n“How would you like to stay here and manage this place?”\n“Well, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I don’t really think I can stay here. It’s too hard.”\n“Couldn’t you stay here and build this building?”\n“I could. But it is very difficult. And I was all set to go to New York.” Bhāgavata began excitedly telling Prabhupāda about a telegram from Ādi-keśava Swami in New York inviting him to come and head an important preaching department in the temple.\n“New York?” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “They have too many men in New York already. You don’t have to go to New York. You should stay here.”\nBhāgavata objected; he couldn’t work with Gargamuni Swami, the G.B.C. man for this area of India. Prabhupāda replied that he was sending Gargamuni to Bangladesh; he wouldn’t be in charge of ISKCON in Orissa anymore. Prabhupāda would personally supervise Bhāgavata.\nBhāgavata dāsa’s next objection was that his health was not good, and he had to sleep a lot.\n“This is a very healthy place,” Prabhupāda countered. “You simply go out in the field to pass stool, then wash with yourloṭā,and afterwards clean theloṭāwith the mud. And you can bathe with the sameloṭā.In this way you will stay clean and healthy.”\nBhāgavata then raised his ultimate objection. “Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said, “to tell you the truth, I’m not chanting my rounds. I think I’d better go to New York, because there is good association there, and I can become strong in my regulations.”\n“That’s all right,” Prabhupāda replied. “You are working very hard. So if sometimes you aren’t chanting your rounds, that’s all right. As long as you are working hard, you can do your rounds at another time.”\n“Well, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Bhāgavata dāsa, “according to theGurvaṣṭakam,I can understand that whenever you please the spiritual master you please Kṛṣṇa.”\nPrabhupāda smiled. “Yes.”\n“So if you want me to stay here, then I should stay.”\n“Yes, I want you to stay here – make life members, build this building, and help manage the place.” Although Prabhupāda had laid a cornerstone for a temple, the center had no funds or donors in sight and no established congregation. All the devotees had was faith in Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s train was to leave at 11 o’clock the next night, and Prabhupāda sat in his little hut talking with his disciples until it was time to go. The conversation ranged from World War II politics to the Tenth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.At one point, Śrīla Prabhupāda was saying how man cannot change the laws of nature. Man should not claim that he knows something or can do something unless he can stop the miseries of birth, death, disease, and old age. “My position means mykarma,” Prabhupāda explained. “If I am in the plush Bhaktivedanta Manor, I have the same suffering as I do in this hut. If I think, ‘Now I am in the Manor. I am happy,’ that is foolishness. But that is how they think. Then why are they dying? They should stop that. Can you, my disciples, help me in old age? You may try your best, but you should admit it is beyond your power. But as soon as you go back home, back to Godhead, everything is solved.”\nHe spoke about diets.Gheewas not good for him, but to eat only boiled food was like starving. He said he was capable of fasting. “If you give me nothing to eat for three days, I can do it.” Gargamuni told Śrīla Prabhupāda of a man he knew in Calcutta who was healthy at ninety and who attributed his health and longevity to his strict diet of only fruits. Gargamuni suggested Prabhupāda try that diet, and Prabhupāda agreed.\nPrabhupāda mentioned the diet of his spiritual master. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, he said, ate very little, but not only fruits. He liked to eat salty things, and his favorite preparation was made from chick pea flour and peanuts fried inghee.\nAfter the talk, when devotees were commenting about Prabhupāda’s proposed fruit diet, Hari-śauri remarked affectionately, “He has said that before, but he will never do it.”\nAs the train pulled into Howrah Station, Prabhupāda sat for a few minutes before disembarking. The vendors’ loud cries of“Chāy!Chāy!”*punctuated the overall din of humanity and machines.\n“This modern society!” Prabhupāda sighed. “It is very painful to even see their faces – they are fallen so much. By seeing their faces you become polluted. Last night they disturbed so much. And they think they are happy, they are enjoying life.”\n“But we have to take the risk,” said Satsvarūpa, “to go and preach?”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “If you are engaged in preaching, you are not affected. Sometimesyogīsgo to the Himalayas just to avoid seeing the face of the vicious persons. They practiceyogain a sacred and solitary place. Otherwise, what is this? Simply ‘Chāy, chāy, chāy,’ and cigarette,biḍi,talking nonsense, drinking? Yet the Vedic system is still in India. In the morning they take bath in the villages. In the cities also, at least those who come from the village. You will find in Bombay, many poor men are taking bath early in the morning. You have seen? They will wash their floor, take bath.”\nWith fond thoughts of the pure life in the Vedic village, Śrīla Prabhupāda left the station, passing through the crowds and the noise. He knew Calcutta well, better than any of his disciples. The poverty, chaos, and political slogans did not phase him. It was his hometown. But he had no mundane connections there. He was coming only for a few days – to preach. Then on to Māyāpur.\nMāyāpurFebruary 7, 1977More than eighty Bengaligurukulaboys, along with some one hundred other devotees, greeted Prabhupāda with akīrtanaat the front gate of the Māyāpur Chandrodaya Mandir. The entire ISKCON land seemed to be blooming with flowers, and the freshly painted temple building shone like the first reddish rays of dawn. The new building, a long residential building, was almost completed. “Back to home, back to Godhead,” Prabhupāda said softly, as his car entered the gate and slowly proceeded toward the temple.\nHe was arriving three weeks before hundreds of devotees from all over the world were scheduled to come and be with him for the celebration of Gaura-pūrṇimā, the appearance day of Lord Caitanya. Bhavānanda Goswami and Jayapatāka Swami, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s leaders of ISKCON Māyāpur, ushered him through the crowd ofgurukulaboys and devotees up to the Deity room, where he beheld and bowed before the shining, golden forms of Śri Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava.\nLater, while sitting in his room on the second floor, Śrīla Prabhupāda complimented the devotees for making the grounds so beautiful and clean. Hundreds of flowers decorated his room like a gorgeous garden. “These flowers are your first success,” said Prabhupāda. He sat back, relaxed with the special pleasure and satisfaction he felt when in the atmosphere of his beloved Māyāpur. “For Kṛṣṇa’s service,” he said, “you submit some plan, and He’s very glad. We want some flower for Kṛṣṇa’s service, and Kṛṣṇa is supplying.Everythingwe want for Kṛṣṇa, not for our sense gratification. For Kṛṣṇa we can endeavor multifariously – that is the contribution of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that prior to Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, the Vaiṣṇavas used to live retired lives in Vṛndāvana – no preaching. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī was the first to demonstrate how pure devotees can preach in sophisticated ways, even living in big buildings and utilizing automobiles in the service of Kṛṣṇa.\n“People may be envious that these devotees are living in palatial buildings,” said Prabhupāda, “but Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura saidonlythe devotees shall live in palatial buildings.Onlydevotees. Just like government servants are given the best places to live in. Similarly, those who are devotees, they should be given all facilities. Not extravagancy, not luxury, but nice food, nice place, nice facilities – and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is our mission. This is not dry. Especially you coming from America and Europe, you are not accustomed to the hardships of Indian people. You must have the bare necessities of comfort, and serve Kṛṣṇa. This I am trying to do and utilize.”\nPrabhupāda thanked the devotees present for working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he reiterated his familiar formula that American brains and American money combined with Indian culture could turn the whole world into a heaven.\nLater, Śrīla Prabhupāda went to oversee the new building, the longest building in West Bengal, Jayapatāka Swami said – more than seven hundred feet. Śrīla Prabhupāda said it looked like a train. He inspected all the rooms one by one and emphasized that they must be ready in time for the festival. Walking along the veranda he remarked, “Oh, it is just like Fifth Avenue.”\nThe next few days were quiet. Prabhupāda would sit taking his massage in the late morning on the roof amid hundreds of potted plants. Leaning on the rail of the veranda outside his room one day, he looked down onto the lawn where one of the women was picking flowers for the Deities. “This is temple,” he said, “ – always something going on. And with each flower picked, she advances in spiritual life a little more.” Prabhupāda particularly liked that the Māyāpur Chandrodaya Mandir was always being expanded and improved. He liked to look out from the veranda and see guests arriving, devotees working, and new plans manifesting.\nBut Prabhupāda’s ill health persisted – an imbalance ofpittaandvāyu(bile and air), he said. One morning when his servant asked him how he felt, he replied, “Very bad.” But sometimes after a “very bad” morning, he would feel much better.\nThe devotees did not think of Prabhupāda’s illness in a material way, but it caused them anxiety. Over the years he had gone through various health crises, and the devotees knew these illnesses were transcendental, directly controlled by Kṛṣṇa. In 1974, when he had been very ill in Vṛndāvana, he had said that the cause was his disciples’ not strictly following the rules and principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. His disciples knew they had to strictly follow his orders if they actually cared for his health. He would go on taking risks – accepting more disciples, traveling and preaching – but his disciples had to avoid acting in ways that would disturb his health. Mostly the devotees preferred to think that Prabhupāda’s health would soon improve. And Śrīla Prabhupāda himself did not dwell on the subject; he was too absorbed in spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nA few days after his arrival, Śrīla Prabhupāda journeyed by car and ferry to Navadvīpa to visit theāśramaof his Godbrother Bhaktirakṣaka Śrīdhara Mahārāja. But while walking up the steep stone steps, Prabhupāda’s legs suddenly gave way, and he collapsed. Fortunately, Hari-śauri was close enough to catch him. It was the second time Prabhupāda had collapsed in less than two weeks. Both times he had been actively preaching, and both times he had continued on his way with no mention of what had happened.\nIn Bhubaneswar, Śrīla Prabhupāda had promised Svarūpa Dāmodara he would go to Manipur with him after the Māyāpur festival. Manipur, an independent country north of India, was mentioned in the Vedic literature, Prabhupāda said. Arjuna’s wife Citrāṅgadā had come from Manipur, and it had been ruled by Kṛṣṇa consciouskṣatriyas.Now Śrīla Prabhupāda, encouraged by Svarūpa Dāmodara, who was born and raised in Manipur, was eager to go and try to revive a Kṛṣṇa conscious state there. But with his weakening health, he questioned whether he should travel.\nHari-śauri, who had been with Prabhupāda continually for eighteen months, felt that Prabhupāda’s health was not likely to improve. And in one sense, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was spreading so widely under Prabhupāda’s direction that it was perhaps not so necessary for Prabhupāda to travel, at least not with the extraordinary expenditure of energy and strength that he had been displaying for the last ten years. Maybe he could retire from traveling. Even during the previous summer, when he had been traveling in the United States, he had once remarked that he simply wanted to go there to become encouraged by how well his devotees were managing everything by themselves. He used to say that he had laid the foundation and erected the framework for the building of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement; now his followers simply had to fill it in. He would often say he had injected medicine into the system of materialistic society; now it would spread and act. He also said he had ignited the fire that would now rage around the world. Therefore, although he was always anxious for his movement, he had confidence.\nOne morning just after breakfast, Prabhupāda was on his veranda looking out across the land of Māyāpur. Turning to Hari-śauri, he said, “Actually it does not matter even if I die immediately. I have given the basis for everything, and now if they simply manage things nicely and follow whatever programs I have begun, then everything will be successful.” Hari-śauri was disturbed to hear such statements, and he remained speechless. Then Prabhupāda added, “But still I would like to finish thisŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.”\n“What is the complaint of the opposing party?” asked Prabhupāda. Again, as when he had argued with Rāmeśvara Swami, he defended the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement while his disciples fired materialistic arguments at him. It was not just an exercise; he was training his disciples. He had to answer any arguments that had discouraged or weakened them. And beyond that, he was actually the ultimate defender of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n“They say we are zombies,” said Brahmānanda.\n“Zombies?” Prabhupāda asked. “What is that?”\n“Zombies,” said Hari-śauri. “Like a robot. We have no brain. We are like machines. They say we have no freedom of choice.”\n“Children have got also the same thing,” replied Prabhupāda. “But the father stops. Children want to play; they do not like to go to school. Father does not like it. Is that father’s attempt to check the child’s freedom? Every father is doing that. The government is doing that. Why the government is checking criminals?”\nPrabhupāda was interested to hear other news, and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami reported on the new ISKCON farm in Pennsylvania and on the restaurant in New York City. Brahmānanda Swami talked about their new farm in Africa, and both he and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa gave their impression of things at Hare Krishna Land in Bombay and reported on Gopāla Kṛṣṇa’s progress in printing Prabhupāda’s books in various Indian languages.\n“So this is the thing that is starting to happen now,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “They are lobbying in the Congress of the United States to pass laws that if someone is abnormal then the parents should have the right to commit him to psychological treatments. Even though the child may be fifty years old and the parents seventy years old, if the parents think that the child is not sane, then they have the right to have the child committed.”\n“This is very dangerous,” said Prabhupāda.\nThey told Prabhupāda of a devotee who had been kidnapped while distributing books at an airport. The court had given the girl’s parents legal authority to have her confined for thirty days in a special center in Arizona run by deprogrammers. They also told him that among the lobbyists advocating kidnapping were powerful groups of Christians and Jews, who had become active because they saw that other movements, not only the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, were taking young people away from the religion of their parents. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested that a probable result of ISKCON’s court case in New York would be to establish ISKCON as bona fide. Defenders of civil rights in America were alarmed at the threat to constitutional liberties, and therefore the court case was generating great interest. It was a test of freedom of religion. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa told Prabhupāda it was the biggest test case of the decade, and that the American Civil Liberties Union had taken it as one of their main priorities.\n“Two states have passed laws making this deprogramming legal,” said Brahmānanda Swami. “And they also give tax exemption. That means the government is giving support.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “They are afraid that these Kṛṣṇa conscious men may capture the government.”\n“Yes,” agreed Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, “some of them are saying that the Kṛṣṇa conscious organization is very powerful and that our ambition is to take over the world.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda laughed. “That’s a fact. Well, let us see. It is a fight between Kṛṣṇa and demon. Let us do our duty and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa; everything will be all right. There were so many demons. Prahlāda Mahārāja was five-years-old boy and his father was such a big demon. But still Prahlāda Mahārāja was victorious. Similarly, you are all like Prahlāda Mahārāja. The fight is there. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Depend on Kṛṣṇa. You will come out victorious. Nṛsiṁhadeva will come. So the ‘poison’ of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is acting now. That is good. If we come out victorious, that will be a great victory.”\nAs they spoke, the electricity went off, and Prabhupāda’s room, as well as the rest of the building, was in darkness. Within a few moments a devotee entered with a kerosene lantern. Prabhupāda began to reminisce, saying that electricity had been introduced in India when he was a young boy. At first not every house could afford electricity, he said, and if a man had a good gas light in his house, he was considered rich. He said the street lamps were carbon arc, and the man who changed the carbon rods would throw the used ones in the street. “When the carbon would be changed,” said Prabhupāda, “they would throw, and we children would collect them.”\n“What would you do with them?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda laughed and said, “Play – ‘We have collected something.’ So electricity was introduced in our life when we were ten or twelve.”\n“But still you were able to read,” said Brahmānanda.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “with this lantern.” He recalled that his father would purchase kerosene for the lanterns. His father was not rich, but by buying and stocking things in quantity, he used to amply provide for his family. Life was simple then, Prabhupāda concluded, but civilized.\nThesannyāsīsbegan telling Prabhupāda about how a military dictatorship had taken over in Argentina and had officially banned the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Twenty thousand dollars’ worth of books had been seized, and devotees had been arrested. Many other persons were being regularly arrested or shot in the streets.\n“Things are deteriorating everywhere,” said Prabhupāda.\n“Very quickly,” added Brahmānanda.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “So this will give impetus to Kṛṣṇa consciousness –yadā yadā hi dharmasya glāniḥ.*Don’t be disappointed. Kṛṣṇa will act through His movement and kill them, these demons. How it will be done, that you cannot know now, but it will be done. Let us remain true soldiers. That’s all. And suppose you die in the fight? Fight means with vow, with determination either to gain victory or die. Because it is a fight againstmāyā.Why you shall be afraid of being killed? When there is a fight, one must know that, ‘Either I’m going to be killed or gain victory.’Jīva vā mara vā.Those who are devotees, either they live or they die, it’s the same thing. While they live they are serving Kṛṣṇa. When they die they will serve Kṛṣṇa.Jīva vā mara vā. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.*He goes to Kṛṣṇa. So what is the loss? We are working for Kṛṣṇa, and if we die we go to Kṛṣṇa. What is the loss?”\n“This movement is not brainwashing,” Prabhupāda began, “we are brain-giving. First of all you must have brain. Then there is a question of washing. But you have no brain. You do not know what is this life. You cannot explain what is the difference between a dead man and a living man. You have got so many big, big scientists and philosophers, but you do not know. So where is your brain? First of all prove your brain. Then there can be a question of washing. It is not brainwashing. It is brain-giving movement. Unfortunately, you have no brain. Therefore you misunderstand. On this point theBhagavad-gītāwill explain. What do you think? Brainwashing or brain-giving?”\n“Yes,” said Ādi-keśava, “this is good.” Prabhupāda said the devotees should consult among themselves, write an essay, and send it to the court. His main point was that most people could not understand the simple truth of the soul. They are in need of knowledge, and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is giving essential knowledge of the soul. Therefore it is a brain-giving movement.\nĀdi-keśava took the role of the antagonists. “Well,” he said, “I have a brain, and it is functioning. Otherwise, how could I be speaking to you now? How could I even answer you?”\n“But that speaking and the dog’s barking are the same thing,” said Prabhupāda. “The dog is barking. What is the difference? He is speaking in a different language, that’s all. The dog is barking, and you are speaking. What is the difference?”\nĀdi-keśava: “But they say, ‘We have art. We have science.’ ”\n“Whatever you may have,” Prabhupāda replied, “you cannot answer the ultimate question.”\nArguments flew back and forth, as other devotees in the room challenged Prabhupāda’s logic. But Prabhupāda stuck to his main point. If a man doesn’t know the difference between a dead man and a living man, if he doesn’t know the soul, then he has no brain. When the devotees mentioned faith in scripture, Prabhupāda said that he was not arguing on the basis of scripture, but on logic. Whatever arguments they raised, Prabhupāda strongly defeated. There was no trace of illness or weakness in Prabhupāda’s demeanor as he drilled his men on how to defend by aggressive argument.\n“They say that this discussion is beyond our intelligence,” said Ādi-keśava.\n“If you say beyond your intelligence,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “that means you have no brain.”\nIn Prabhupāda’s association, Ādi-keśava gained strength and conviction. “They complain,” said Ādi-keśava, “that if one becomes a devotee, he suffers from loss of identity. But actually, they don’t know who they are. So we will challenge them like that, ‘What is this loss of identity? You don’t even know who you are. So you have nothing to lose.’ ”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, with great spirit. “What is your identification?Thatyou do not know. We are teaching that by identifying yourself with this body, you have lost your identity.”\n“Most of their charges,” said Ādi-keśava, “are based on misconceptions about our movement. For instance, they say that we do not eat enough or sleep enough. Yet we have studies from their own scientists that say our diet is good.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “How we are living if our diet is not good? Ten years we are eating insufficiently? Then how we are living? You do not know what is good food, but the result you have to know. A cow eats so much grass, and a human being eats a small plateful. If the cow says, ‘You are not eating sufficient like me,’ is that logic?”\n“No,” said Ādi-keśava, “it is not logic.”\nPrabhupāda: “So you are just like cows and asses. You eat voraciously. Does it mean I have to eat voraciously?”\n“But what proof is there?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami. “They may argue for proof of the soul.”\n“This is proof,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Now if the real active principle has left, if you can understand it, then replace it. Replace life. If you cannot, then you have no brain.” Prabhupāda argued that at death, although the parts of a body remained, something was missing.\n“But you have not seen that something,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“See it or not,” said Prabhupāda, “I can see. Why this man is dead? Something is missing.”\n“Well,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “it’s just like a machine.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda became fiery. “A machine you can replace! Why don’t you bring a new body and replace the dead one? Therefore you have no brain! It is a completely different thing!”\nPrabhupāda said this philosophy of the soul should be presented in court. “It will be very interesting,” he said. “The case will prolong, and we can disclose our whole philosophy. Is it not? Think deeply, over and over, and fight. Tell them, ‘What is your seeing? You cannot see beyond this wall. Does it mean there is nothing? Why depend on your seeing, rascal? You are being brainless.’ I take it as a good opportunity for describing our whole philosophy. Don’t take it as otherwise. Rather, prove yourself sufficient in this subject matter. This is a trial examination.”\nThe devotees told Prabhupāda how critics were examining the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamand trying to find fault with the devotees on the basis of their philosophy. They were challenged in court about Prabhupāda’s statement that man had not gone to the moon.\n“I personally did not go with you,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “So how shall I believe? From the practical point of view, I did not go. It is just some news, so why should I accept it? They believe some paper, that’s all. So why shall we not believe the Vedic literatures? Vedic literature is so authoritative. It has been accepted by theācāryas.”\nNext the devotees began talking about how the parents and deprogrammers justified their use of force. “This clouds the issue in the courtroom,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, “because everyone naturally feels very sympathetic toward the fathers and mothers.”\n“Why don’t you quote from ourśāstra,” replied Śrīla Prabhupāda, “that he is not father –pitā na sa syāt.Find this verse.”\nPradyumna had the book off the shelf and his finger on the verse within a few seconds. He read,gurur na sa syāt sva-jano na sa syāt, pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt / daivaṁ na tat syān na patiś ca sa syān, na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.“One who cannot deliver his dependents from the path of repeated birth and death should never become a spiritual master, a father, husband, mother, or worshipable demigod.”\n“So how is he the father?” asked Prabhupāda. “What is the purport?”\nĀdi-keśava Swami: “They argue sometimes that —”\n“You will argue your point,” interrupted Prabhupāda, “but our point is there. We shall argue from our point of view. Unless the father releases the son from the cycle of birth and death, he is not father.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda never let up, and finally he concluded, “If you try to advise a rascal, he will be angry. So this is the position. Still, we have to do our business. What can be done? Difficult task. Therefore, if you want to please Kṛṣṇa very quickly, struggle for preaching:ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati.So we have got our business, to please Kṛṣṇa. That is our mission. So despite so many inconveniences, we have to do this business.Mūḍho ’yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam.*They are allmūḍhas.So we have been engaged to teach them some lesson.”\nĀdi-keśava mentioned that an official in the Indian Embassy had said that the Indian government would give him asylum if necessary. Śrīla Prabhupāda was pleased to hear this. When Ādi-keśava admitted that he was sometimes discouraged and alone in the prolonged legal struggle, Prabhupāda said he could take other men with him to help. But the main backing Ādi-keśava required was from Śrīla Prabhupāda; he wanted Prabhupāda’s mercy. And Prabhupāda, like a father, gave solace and courage to his young, rather frail-looking son who was going into battle. Don’t be afraid, Prabhupāda said. Repeatedly he would call Ādi-keśava to his room to give him more mercy: another logical argument, an instruction on how he should act in court. Prabhupāda’s essential advice, of which Ādi-keśava was now aware and convinced, was that he should preach; Kṛṣṇa would protect him.\nPrabhupāda’s dictation continued:\nNow the very same arguments that Prabhupāda had spoken to thesannyāsīswere immortalized in the Bhaktivedanta purports. In the future, after the court case had been finished and mostly forgotten, Prabhupāda’s true assessment of the situation would prevail.\nSoon the Māyāpur Chandrodaya Mandir was teeming with transcendental activity; the Gaura-pūrṇimā festival was in full swing. The Vaikuṇṭha Players of New York staged an evening theater performance of theRāmāyaṇa,and Śrīla Prabhupāda attended. The audience watched and appreciated Śrīla Prabhupāda almost as much as they did the play.\nOn the opening night of thepaṇḍāl,a government minister attended to officially inaugurate the festivities. He cut a ribbon to open the new building, and he and Śrīla Prabhupāda walked together down the long first-floor corridor and viewed a photo display of ISKCON centers around the world. Halfway down the corridor Śrīla Prabhupāda stopped, shook his head, and said, “It is all inconceivable.” The minister was also amazed at the scale on which Śrīla Prabhupāda was propagating Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda and his guest went onto the stage. The minister gave an introductory speech, glorifying a well-known impersonalist swami, referring to him as a divine incarnation. He also slighted the name of Lord Caitanya by saying that although he didn’t know whether Caitanya Mahāprabhu was an incarnation, he knew He had certainly done good in the world.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda spoke next, using scriptural evidence to correct the erroneous opinions the minister had given in his talk. Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke in Bengali, and most of his disciples could not understand, but they could appreciate the gist. Later, when Śrīla Prabhupāda was sitting in his room with a few devotees, he began laughing. Smacking his fist into his left palm, he said, “I have smashed him.”\nWith Gaura-pūrṇimā only about a week away, thousands of Bengali pilgrims were attending the ISKCON center each night. They streamed into the temple room forkīrtanaanddarśanaof Rādhā-Mādhava and then went to see the ISKCON photo exhibit. It was the biggest and best organized Māyāpur festival ever. Despite the opposition in America, Lord Caitanya’s movement was flooding the world with the waves ofsaṅkīrtana,and this gathering of more than five hundred devotees from every continent was a powerful testimony to the good health of the growing Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nRāmeśvara Swami returned with the latest figures of Prabhupāda’s book production. In the English language alone Śrīla Prabhupāda had published 43,450,500 pieces of literature. And the total production of Prabhupāda’s books in twenty-three languages, including Russian, was 55,314,000, more than ninety percent of which had already been distributed. Rāmeśvara also presented Śrīla Prabhupāda with a new book just off the press, the Ninth Canto, Part One, ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Rādhāvallabha reported that the next printing ofBhagavad-gītāAs It Iswould be so large that the paper required to print it would have to be carried on seventy-six train cars. Prabhupāda and the devotees laughed at the astounding figures.\nPrabhupāda thanked the devotees for their hard work. “This is the blessing of my Guru Mahārāja,” he said. “He wanted it. And because we are trying to do this, he is giving us all blessings.”\nThe G.B.C. men began their annual three days of meetings, and each evening they would meet with Prabhupāda. He heard their proposals and, after making some corrections, approved them. The final item on the G.B.C.’s list of resolutions was that all ISKCON temples hold twenty-four-hourkīrtana,in view of Prabhupāda’s sickness. The devotees had also done this in 1974 when Prabhupāda had been ill. “Yes,” Prabhupāda said when he heard the resolution, “chanting is the only cure for all diseases.”\nOn Gaura-pūrṇimā, Śrīla Prabhupāda accepted more than two hundred disciples for first initiation, and he awarded second initiation to one hundred disciples. Huge crowds poured through the front gate all day; and from four P.M. until late at night, the roads would be packed and thekīrtanaswould attract large receptive audiences.\nIn the afternoon Śrīla Prabhupāda received Tarun Kanti Ghosh, the home minister for Bengal, also in charge of the state police force. Prabhupāda spoke with Mr. Ghosh in his room and found him very favorable toward ISKCON and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had decided to stay on in Māyāpur instead of accompanying the devotees to Vṛndāvana for the second half of the festival, so some of the leaders came to his room to pay their respects before departing. When Harikeśa Swami and Ādi-keśava Swami entered together, Prabhupāda told Harikeśa that because the people in the Communist countries were suffering so much, he should give them books without making them pay. Turning to Ādi-keśava, he said he had placed much responsibility on Ādi-keśava’s thin shoulders but that he should be victorious. “So you are Harikeśa and Ādi-keśava,” he said, “the Keśa brothers. So go and preach. Be successful.” Śrīla Prabhupāda similarly spoke lovingly with other G.B.C. men as they departed for their assigned areas around the world.\nWithin a few days, Māyāpur was again quiet, with very few visiting devotees remaining.\n“My mission is now successful,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “In 1965 I went there. This is now recognized after twelve years. I was loitering in the street alone, carrying the books. Nobody cared.”\nSvarūpa Dāmodara was present, and he spoke with Prabhupāda about the Bhaktivedanta Institute and about preaching in Manipur. And other matters came before Prabhupāda’s attention. But he kept coming back to the news from New York. “Our most auspicious sign is this,” said Prabhupāda, “ – ‘Hare Krishna Movement Is Bona Fide Religion.’ ”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s plans were to move to Bombay. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami said a lot of senior devotees were gathering in Bombay. They had gone there from Vṛndāvana and were waiting for Prabhupāda. “I am, therefore, going,” said Prabhupāda, “in spite of my so much inconveniences. I am going there.”\n“You want to stay in Bombay?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “How long?”\n“I don’t want to stay anywhere,” said Prabhupāda. “I want to work. Staying – I have stayed in big, big palaces, big, big cities. I have no other desire but to work.”\n“How long do you want to work in Bombay?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“So long as there is work,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “There is no end of it. Our Bombay should be organized. Work is our life. There is no question of how long. As long as possible. Kṛṣṇa is giving us good opportunities. Now we should take it seriously. It is not a joke – ‘Hare Krishna Movement Is Bona Fide Religion.’ ”\nThe devotees discussed before Prabhupāda the significance of the court decision. They also appreciated the judge and said that he was a senior man in the courts and was considered conservative. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that he should be sent a letter of congratulations: “May God bless you for such right judgment. Live long life to serve God.”\n“Honest and sincere people normally appreciate our movement,” said Svarūpa Dāmodara. “Only those who are envious —”\n“Envious we don’t care about,” Prabhupāda interjected. “We don’t care, never care about. I didn’t care – many times, even my Godbrothers. Neither do I care just now. I’ll go on with my work. Why care? We are doing our duty, that’s all – under the higher authoritative order. Have no fear. It is not personal gratification. So arrange for Manipur. We shall go.”\nSvarūpa Dāmodara said he would go to Delhi and try to arrange permits for entry, but that it would be hard, since most foreigners were not allowed to enter Manipur. He said that after doing his business, he would come to Bombay and see Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“Now work very strenuously,” said Prabhupāda. “You are all young men. And somehow or other, to a dead horse you have given life. The last fortnight I was thinking I was dead. I was thinking like that – now life is finished. I can be finished at any time – that is not amazing. To live, that is amazing. My life is finished – that is not amazing. No one will lament. ‘Oh, he was old man, eighty-two years old.’ But if I can live for some days more, that is wonderful. If I die that is not wonderful.”\n“Kṛṣṇa is wonderful,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami.\n“Kṛṣṇa is wonderful always,” said Prabhupāda.\n“And you are wonderful,” said Bhavānanda Goswami.\n“I am wonderful,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “as long as I serve Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, useless, no value. If I can serve Kṛṣṇa, then I am wonderful, certainly.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued declaring that Kṛṣṇa was the most wonderful and could do anything. That he was alive and still active, he said, attested to Kṛṣṇa’s being wonderful. “If Kṛṣṇa is not wonderful,” he said, “is it possible for me to do all these things? Who am I? We don’t want to become cheaply wonderful. We want to become really wonderful, by serving Kṛṣṇa. That is our mission. Kṛṣṇa is wonderful undoubtedly. Who can become more wonderful than Kṛṣṇa?Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat.Always remember, Kṛṣṇa is wonderful. Don’t take Kṛṣṇa very slightly, like one of you. That is foolishness. Kṛṣṇa is wonderful always. He is the most wonderful person, and He can do anything wonderful.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued to make appreciative remarks about the judge’s decision. He said he had feared the case might have taken fourteen years, and yet it had not even taken fourteen hours. Kṛṣṇa was so wonderful.\nMarch 22The senior devotees in Māyāpur felt Śrīla Prabhupāda was too ill to travel and that he should remain there and recuperate. Besides, reports from Bombay were conflicting. Surabhi Swami, knowing that Prabhupāda’s quarters weren’t finished, wanted more time, so he wired Prabhupāda, requesting him not to come. But Girirāja and others had been arranging a lecture program for Śrīla Prabhupāda at apaṇḍālin Azad Maidan in Bombay, and Girirāja had written inviting Prabhupāda. Prabhupāda considered the opportunities for preaching and decided to go. He had his secretary send a telegram from Māyāpur to Bombay.\nBut on Prabhupāda’s arrival in Bombay, he was so weak that he could not walk down the steep stairs from the airplane, and airline personnel arranged for him to be lowered to the ground by hydraulic lift. Once he was on the ground, several devotees assisted him in walking. Although he appeared frail, he smiled brightly when he saw the devotees waiting for him at the airport.\nIn the car Śrīla Prabhupāda inquired about the Bombay temple, and Hari-śauri informed him that his quarters were not yet ready, with no toilet, no running water, no doors or windows, and the workmen polishing the floors. Prabhupāda dismissed these objections and said he would move in anyway. The devotees who knew the state of the building became extremely anxious. It didn’t seem possible that anyone could live there. But Prabhupāda said he would.\nHari-śauri said he was surprised Prabhupāda had decided to travel, and Prabhupāda replied, “Yes, even up to last night, there was no chance of my coming. But still, somehow or other, we are here.” Prabhupāda was traveling and preaching because that was his life. For more than thirty years he had been spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement – first in India and then in America and throughout the world. As long as Kṛṣṇa gave him even a little strength, he would continue. He wanted to hold the public lectures in the city, and he wanted to observe the progress of the construction at Hare Krishna Land, his grandest temple. Even though the temple was not completed, he would move in and show the devotees how to use it.\nAs they drove up to the entrance to Hare Krishna Land, Prabhupāda could see the tall towers of the ISKCON hotel and the incomplete but massive domes of the temple. These huge structures dwarfed the little shed that was the temporary residence of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Rāsavihārī. The Deities had been in that shed since 1971, when Prabhupāda had moved Them there, with a promise that he would build Them a beautiful temple. And now, after much difficulty and struggle, that promise was soon to be fulfilled. Rādhā-Rāsavihārī would soon move into one of the most gorgeous and opulent temples in India.\nHare Krishna Land was intense with activity as some two hundred workers plied their various skills in constructing the temple-hotel complex, under the direction of Surabhi Swami and his assistants. A dozen men were cutting redstone slabs to cover the concrete superstructure of the hotel; almost fifty marble workers were chipping away with hammers, making decorative columns and arches in the temple; and masons and interior finishers were working on the theater building. Much of the work was completed, yet everything still appeared bare, like bones without flesh. The hotel had no windows or doors and, of course, no furniture or curtains, and the temple was mostly an unfinished structure.\nThe work crews were moving quickly, concentrating especially on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s quarters on the top floor of one of the hotel towers. But even that was not ready, so Citrakāra, as ordered by Surabhi Swami and Girirāja, drove Prabhupāda’s car past the hotel to the rear of the property, to where Prabhupāda usually stayed, in an apartment in one of the old tenement buildings.\nDevotees were waiting at Śrīla Prabhupāda’s tenement room in happy anticipation. They were prepared with paraphernalia to perform a foot-bathing ceremony andārati,and they had spent most of the day cleaning the rooms, which were decorated with lily garlands and scented with incense. A group of devotees stood outside the building withmṛdaṅgasandkaratālasholdingkīrtana,and some of thebrahmacāriṇīswere poised, ready to throw flower petals before Śrīla Prabhupāda when he walked from his car and up the stairs. But Śrīla Prabhupāda was in a different mood. “I will never again go into this apartment,” he said. “Take me to my new quarters.” Citrakāra repeated what Śrīla Prabhupāda had already heard: “Your quarters aren’t ready yet, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It will take a few more days to finish.”\n“Call Surabhi Mahārāja,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. He was adamant. The devotees in the apartment and in front of the tenement wondered why Śrīla Prabhupāda wasn’t getting out of his car. As Citrakāra was driving Prabhupāda back to the hotel, Surabhi came running up behind.\n“Why are my quarters not ready?” Prabhupāda asked from the car window. Running to catch up, Surabhi explained that he needed a few more days and that Śrīla Prabhupāda could please stay at his old apartment in the meantime.\n“You do what I say!” shouted Prabhupāda. The car stopped. “If I don’t go there now,” Prabhupāda said, still speaking loudly, “it will never be finished. I want to gonow!”\n“Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.” And Surabhi ran off to see if he could get the elevator to work. Meanwhile, the assembled devotees, having heard the news, also ran to be with Prabhupāda as he entered his new quarters.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda felt his time was limited, and if he was not insistent, his disciples would delay more and more. He had already been delayed for years by the landowner and the government. Even after he had purchased the land, the police commissioner had remarked that thekīrtanawas “a nuisance” and had delayed construction for months by denying the No Objection Certificate. But despite so many delays, Prabhupāda had persisted and won. No, he wouldn’t go back to the old place.Nowthe new Bombay temple should come to life – now that he had come.\nThe elevator didn’t work. The devotees, therefore, carried Prabhupāda in a palanquin up the stairs to his fifth-floor apartment. The place was cluttered, and the floor was covered with a thick, greasy marble polish the workers were using. The dozen workers present were confused – why was their work being interrupted? The devotees rushed in with drums,karatālas,andāratiparaphernalia, but just stood around, not knowing what to do. The room was bare, with no furniture, desk, or sitting place.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda, however, looked around at the chaotic scene and said, “I am going to sit down here.” A devotee took off a woolencādaraand placed it on the floor in an isolated dry part of the room, and Śrīla Prabhupāda sat down. “Now you can do what you like,” he said.\nWhile some of the devotees began washing the floor, others ran to find serviceable pieces of furniture to provide Śrīla Prabhupāda with a desk, seat, and bed. Surabhi Swami nervously bathed Prabhupāda’s feet and then offeredārati,while devotees sangśrī-guru-caraṇa-padmaand tried not to slip on the greasy floor. Surveying the scene with a satisfied look, Śrīla Prabhupāda smiled broadly and said, “Thank you very much.”\nWhen the welcoming function was complete, Śrīla Prabhupāda was left alone with his secretaries. He said his quarters were to his liking. He spent the night there, but the next day agreed to move for a week to the home of Mr. Kartikeya Mahadevia. For a week he would attend the Bombaypaṇḍālprogram, which was near Mr. Mahādevia’s home, and this would give Surabhi Swami enough time to get the quarters ready.\nCompared to formerpaṇḍālfestivals, where sometimes thirty thousand people had gathered in one evening, this one was small, with only about a thousand attending nightly. The main reason for such a small turnout was that India had just held an election, and the people were absorbed in politics. On March 22, after the Congress party had been defeated in the House of Parliament, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had resigned. Within a day or two, a new prime minister would be selected from the Janata party. Many Bombayites who might otherwise have attended thepaṇḍāllecture were caught up in hearing the news, attending rallies, or talking about national politics and the fall of Indira Gandhi. But the small crowd that attended was very interested. Prabhupāda was not disappointed.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda spoke, and his faint voice was amplified over the sound system. “Bhavānanda Swami will recite two or three verses fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,” he said, “which is the theme of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. The first verse begins withtaravaḥ kiṁ na jīvanti.”\n“Do the trees not live?” Bhavānanda recited loudly. “Do the bellows of the blacksmith not breathe? All around us do the beasts not eat and discharge semen?” He read Śrīla Prabhupāda’s purport and then read the next verse: “Men who are like dogs, hogs, camels, and asses praise those men who never listen to the transcendental pastimes of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the deliverer from evils.” After Bhavānanda finished reading the long purport to that verse, Śrīla Prabhupāda began his lecture. He explained how the spirit soul changes bodies, life after life, but admitted that people are generally unaware of this simple fact. “But at least in India,” he said, “this condition should now be changed.” Not everyone would be able to realize this spiritual knowledge, but at least there should be an ideal institution. And that, he said, was the purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, to create idealbrāhmaṇaswho could guide and instruct the rest of the society.\n“Not from so-called politicians,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “This is Indian civilization. Formerly even Lord Rāmacandra, who was the king – He is God Himself – still He used to consult the learnedbrāhmaṇas,sages, and saintly persons for governmental duties. The divisions of society must be there. There are so many things to be done in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Don’t take that it is simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa chanting is the prime factor, because if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇamahā-mantra,then gradually everything will be clear in your mind.”\nPrabhupāda told how he had overcome opposition in America and how the people there were taking Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously. When he stated his plan for a combination of American money and Indian culture, the people applauded. “The real thing is knowledge,” Śrīla Prabhupāda concluded. “So don’t keep this knowledge locked up in your books, but spread it. My only request is that the leaders of India should now come forward and join this movement and take this advantage of doing good to the whole world. Thank you very much.” The audience’s applause swelled into a sustained ovation.\nPrabhupāda’s voice had been weak, his body almost motionless, but he had projected a power that had overcome those bodily limitations. His presence was, in fact, more commanding than ever. His energy was obviously the pure energy of the soul, transcendental to the bodily condition. Girirāja Swami called for questions, inviting people to come up and speak into a microphone in front of the stage.\nWoman: “Isn’t spiritual life very taxing?”\nPrabhupāda: “Do you think that you are not being taxed? Why should you not be taxed for the proper gain? You are being taxed for so many nonsense things. Why not be taxed for the proper thing? That is intelligence.”\nAs Prabhupāda answered the questions, he became more and more forceful, although he remained very still, not even moving his hand. His answers were not as lengthy as usual – he seemed to be saving his energy – but he delivered each answer with intense emphasis and conviction.\nA well-dressed, middle-aged Indian man stepped forward and asked, “Swamiji, what is the importance of health in life, and how do you advise people to maintain health? And how does it connect to your mission?”\nPrabhupāda: “What is health? First of all you have to understand that however healthy you may be, you must die. So what problem will you have solved?Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam,Kṛṣṇa says. It is not my manufacturing. Although you may try to remain very healthy, nature’s law is that you must die. How can you help yourself? After all, you have to meet death. So long as you have got this material body, there is no question of health. You must suffer. You may be a very great scientist, but nature’s law must act.Prakṛteh kriyamāṇāni.Foolish persons bewildered by false egotism think, ‘I am improving my health, I am improving this… ’ He is improving nothing. He’s completely under the clutches of material nature. He can’t act anything independently. That is the law of nature.”\nAnother man asked if Prabhupāda could solve political problems “with this religious basis.”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied. “All problems will be solved when we become Kṛṣṇa conscious.”\n“What is the simple solution to understand the soul?” another man asked. “I would like to understand the soul.”\n“This is very simple,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied, “but you are educated so foolishly that you cannot understand.” Śrīla Prabhupāda explained briefly that the body is made of material elements but that there is a superior element. “Anyone can understand,” he said. “Everything is explained in theBhagavad-gītā.But people are not serious to understand.”\nIn fact, Śrīla Prabhupāda was becoming increasingly strong in his uncompromising criticism of allmūḍhaswho do not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was condemning materialistic civilization, calling it a dog civilization or an anthill civilization. A dog runs on four legs, and a human being runs on four wheels; but if he doesn’t know the meaning of life, then he is no better than the dog. Both humans and ants build tall edifices, but if a man doesn’t know of the soul and of Kṛṣṇa, then despite his proud skyscrapers, his civilization is no more than a glorified anthill.\n“If more visitors come,” Prabhupāda said, “I shall describe all this anthill civilization. Health – nonsense. What health? He’ll be kicked out immediately.” Śrīla Prabhupāda was referring to the man’s question from thepaṇḍāl.“Whois healthy if he is going to die?” Prabhupāda asked. “ ‘I am so healthy that I am going to die tomorrow.’ This is their health.”\n“Almost every one of those questions,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, “was about the body.”\nPrabhupāda: “Kṛṣṇa says,na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.That is healthy. When you do not die although the body is destroyed, that is healthy life. What is this healthy life? The body is finished – and everything. Actually, everything is not finished, but people are kept in that ignorance. They think the body is finished and then everything is finished, but that is not the fact. Kṛṣṇa very clearly said,na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin.*If you do not question, then how is it possible? But that is the most important question.”\nPrabhupāda mentioned that despite the United Nations World Health Organization, still everyone was going to die. “Where is health?” he asked. “Such foolish things are going on all over the world. So organize. Introduce reality to them and spread it, slow but sure.”\n“So we shouldn’t be impatient and compromise,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, “just to be popular.”\n“There’s no question of becoming impatient,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “You have got a diamond. If there is no buyer of the diamond, that does not mean you have to throw it away. You must know that ‘Here is a diamond. If I want it, I must pay the proper price.’ That I want to establish. Why India’s culture should be lost in this way? I am not a cheap patriot. I want to give Indian culture to the whole world. I am not going to cheat people, takingBhagavad-gītāand speaking all nonsense. I want to presentBhagavad-gītāas it is. That is my mission. Why should I cheat you?”\n“We will try to follow your message properly,” said Mr. Mahadevia.\n“Why should India’s big culture be lost for the matter of these rascal leaders?” said Prabhupāda. “They should be stopped. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is all-inclusive. Just like the economic question:annād bhavanti bhūtāni.Kṛṣṇa says grow food. It is practical. But when I was travelling, I saw millions of clerks coming to get education. And who is growing the food? Then these clerks have to be provided in these pigeonholes and depend on ration. Is that civilization? Throngs of people are coming. They are coming like ants. And when you go to the village, it is all vacant. No one is interested to produce food. Everyone is interested to live in the city in these pigeonholes and go to the cinema, the brothel, go to the club, learn how to drink, how to become ‘gentlemen.’ Is that civilization? The human aim of life is lost. You do not know why you are going to the office, why you are eating. They are keeping humanity in an animal mentality, a doggish mentality. University education is a doggish mentality. The dog wags his tail as soon as you give him some food.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Mahadevia. “For application for a job, there are five jobs, and five dozen people apply.”\n“Is that education?” said Prabhupāda. “Better not to be educated. Those who are not educated, they can purchase five rupees’ worth of potatoes and sit down anywhere. After spending so much money, living at the cost of fathers and mothers, they have no job and no food. Then they plan some political party – Naxalite or this or that party – and join a political movement and help Indira Gandhi. You are paid to make propaganda.”\n“But all that has vanished now,” said Mr. Mahadevia. “That plan has failed completely.” Like many other Indians, Mr. Mahadevia was hopeful that with a new election, conditions would be improving.\n“No,” said Prabhupāda, “another one will come. This unemployment is there. When I was a child, we were purchasing mustard oil for three annas, and now it is selling for thirteen rupees per kilo. Will a change of government bring this thirteen rupees to three annas? Then what is the benefit? Stool is stool, whether you take it from the top side or the bottom side.”\nA few devotees entered the room and sat, while Prabhupāda encouraged them all in preaching. He said that people could not get relief through government but through Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa and His devotees were for everyone, not for a particular nation or person.\n“The people are in darkness,” said Prabhupāda. “And the politicians are keeping them like dogs, hogs, and camels, taking a vote from them and becoming a leader. Nobody protested last night, however, that I called all men dogs, hogs, and camels. No one came forward and said, ‘You are using very strong words.’ Because it is all a fact.”\n“They especially liked your idea,” said Hṛdayānanda Goswami, “of American money and Indian culture. They applauded for that.”\n“Yes, that is my mission,” said Prabhupāda. “I am doing that. I am bringing money from America. Nobody is paying me. It is not a joke. Ten lakhs of rupees. Who else brings?”\n“Even big export companies don’t bring so much,” said Gopāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“And they will be glad,” said Prabhupāda. “They have got money, and they are getting culture. I am trying for united nations. That is the real attempt, not this United Nations, all rogues and thieves and cheaters, barking dogs. I am trying for real United Nations. Let us cooperate together.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s disciples rallied to hear him speak like this, and they resolved to somehow counteract the forces of ignorance through Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He said they should proceed slowly but surely, just as he had done. He had begun humbly, “loitering” on the streets of New York, and before that he had been living alone in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. But now there was the Bombay temple, a palace that would be crowded with thousands of guests to see the Deity and attend cultural programs.\n“Do it enthusiastically,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “You are all young men.”\n“Our enthusiasm is coming from you, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“I am old man,” said Prabhupāda faintly. But the devotees didn’t accept that; Śrīla Prabhupāda wasnava-yauvana,spiritually ever fresh.\nIn his evening lectures Śrīla Prabhupāda advised his hearers against identifying with any political party. One day someone is a prime minister, he said, and the next day that person is finished. Although Prabhupāda had begun his lecture series by apologizing to the audience, saying he could not speak much because of his poor health, each night he very strongly argued that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only solution. And during the question and answer period that followed his lecture, he was often explosive.\n“When chanting,” a man asked through the microphone at the front of the stage, “you chant the name of Rāma as well as Kṛṣṇa. But I do not see any photograph of Rāma here. What is the reason?”\n“You do not see, but can you hear?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“I do not see!” the man insisted.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda exploded, “But you do not hear!” And he went on to explain that hearing is the best way of understanding that which you cannot see.\nAnother man asked how a religious-minded person could move in the material world. Prabhupāda replied, “Therefore you have to understand your spiritual identification. But because you are fools and rascals you are thinking, ‘I am this body.’ ” He said that to realize this knowledge one must be trained by a spiritual master.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was aware that most of the questioners had no serious intentions of following him, so sometimes he reprimanded them, like an older brother, for their foolishness. Even their asking philosophical questions with no intention of following was itself foolishness. But Śrīla Prabhupāda continued to offer the diamond of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even when the inquirer didn’t possess the purchase price of sincerity. He offered it nonetheless, and at great expense to his own physical condition.\nWhen a man rhetorically asked Prabhupāda to kindly enlighten him about the soul, Śrīla Prabhupāda replied, “That is already explained, that you are a soul within the body.” Śrīla Prabhupāda elaborated on how the senses are superior to dull matter, the mind is higher than the senses, intelligence is higher than the mind, and the soul is highest of all. “So it requires study,” he said. “It requires education. The education is there, the books are there, the teachers are there. Unfortunately, you are not interested to take this spiritual education. You are now interested in technology – how to hammer. That’s all.”\nEach evening a prominent guest would appear at thepaṇḍāland introduce the program. One night, after J. M. Gandhi, a justice of the high court of Bombay, spoke, Bhavānanda Goswami read aloud the first two verses, along with Śrīla Prabhupāda’s commentary, from the teachings of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva in the Fifth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke briefly and agreed to take questions.\n“If God is everywhere,” a man asked, “why His presence is not felt by everybody?”\n“Everybody is not intelligent,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Mostly they are rascals.Manuṣyānāṁ sahasreṣu.This is the statement by God that, ‘Out of millions of persons, one tries to become perfect. And out of many millions of perfect persons, one can understand God.’ So God understanding is not so easy. But if we want to understand, God will help us. That is the point.”\nThe next man said he had several questions. “My first question is, I don’t think God is opposed to sex. Seriously. I have heard many a lecture, and it is always stressed as if the God is opposed to sex. But I don’t think that’s so.”\n“God is never opposed to sex,” replied Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Who said? God said,dharmāviruddho kāmo ’smi:‘Sexwhich is not against the regulative principles of religious life, that I am.’ God never says, ‘Stop sex.’ Otherwise, why is theregṛhastha-āśrama?Āśramameans that there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But make itāśrama,and follow the rules and regulations ofāśrama.Then it is all right. Otherwise, you are bound up by the laws of nature.”\nThe same man then referred to Prabhupāda’s purport which Bhavānanda Goswami had read, in which Prabhupāda had criticized the life of the hoglike man who lives only for sense gratification. “One of your principal statements,” the man said, “was that a man goes on the motor tram, stands there for two hours, reaches his place of business and works there from nine o’clock in the morning to five o’clock in the evening, returns back, has his food and sex and all that. I found many people who have worked very hard, raised children very nicely, have sex, but lead a good life. I don’t think there is anything wrong with that.”\n“Yes, if there is no wrong,” said Prabhupāda, “it is all right. But this sort of life is not very palatable.”\nThe man continued, “Because I find even the dog —”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda interrupted, but his reply was soft and humble. “If you like that life, if you feel it is good, then that is up to you. But I don’t think this is a very nice way of life, to work so hard simply for bread.”\n“No,” the man said, “I agree there.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then raised his voice more strongly. “Then agreed, agreed. Then why disagree? That’s all right, no more.” The man had more questions, but Tamāla Kṛṣṇa called on someone else.\n“Would you agree that God is just a concept? If you do not, please give a logical reason for that.”\nPrabhupāda: “Why shall I agree that God is only a concept?”\n“Because I want it logically.”\n“You do not know logic. You have to learn logic.”\n“But I still would like you to explain it logically.”\n“Yes, but you have to learn how to know it. There is master. Just like you cannot prove logically that without father, there is a child.” Śrīla Prabhupāda explained that everything we see is growing out of the earth, and the earth is described in theVedasas the mother. But there cannot be a child without a father; where there is mother and child, there must be father. God, therefore, is the father of everything.\nThe following night Prabhupāda did not speak at all, but he sat onstage while two of India’s leading cardiologists, Dr. Kesharrao Datey and Dr. Sharma, spoke. Śrīla Prabhupāda had been garlanded by Dr. Datey, and he sat patiently and silently on thevyāsāsana,satisfied that prominent Bombayites were honoring the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Dr. Datey spoke about heart disease and said it could be eliminated by controlling anxiety. He then praised Śrīla Prabhupāda and his movement. After the doctors’ brief talks, Svarūpa Dāmodara gave another scientific lecture and showed slides. Śrīla Prabhupāda later told Svarūpa Dāmodara and others, “This scientific program is giving me extra strength to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\n“It seems like you are giving more stress to science in recent years than previously,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami.\n“That is required for convincing the modernized man,” said Prabhupāda. “Perhaps I am the first man who protested against these unauthorized scientists.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Svarūpa Dāmodara. “Everybody is afraid of them except Śrīla Prabhupāda. Frankly speaking, I never knew that the problem was this serious before I met Śrīla Prabhupāda. I never thought about this.”\n“Therefore I took it so seriously,” said Prabhupāda. “Every morning walk I would look for you and ask, ‘Where is the scientist?’ I thought, ‘Here I have got an opportunity to impress a scientist, and that will fructify.’ That was my aim. Therefore I was bothering you in so many ways.”\n“It is your incredible mercy, Prabhupāda,” said Svarūpa Dāmodara.\n“Because I cannot use the technical words,” Prabhupāda said, “and he can do that. So I wanted that he should be trained up.”\n“When I went there,” Girirāja told Prabhupāda later, “he asked me to sit with them on a dais. So I did. But was that wrong?”\n“Why not?” said Prabhupāda. “He is honoring you.”\nGirirāja said that Mr. Rajda had asked to be the first speaker at the rally, so that he could be free to come and meet with Śrīla Prabhupāda before leaving the next day for a meeting with the central government in Delhi. Girirāja explained that Mr. Rajda was a member of Parliament from Bombay South, which was the most prestigious district, and that he had formerly helped ISKCON in their case against the attempted demolition of the temple.\nMr. Rajda entered the room and made a respectful gesture of obeisance to Śrīla Prabhupāda. He said he had met Śrīla Prabhupāda once, but since then he had been in jail for nineteen months. Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed surprised. “Jail?” he asked.\nMr. Rajda explained that he had been jailed during Indira Gandhi’s political emergency. More than 150,000 “patriotic people” had been imprisoned, he said, including J. K. Prakash and the present prime minister, Morarji Desai.\n“When Girirāja told me that you were here,” said Mr. Rajda, “I told him definitely I would like to ask fordarśana.”\n“This attempt at material adjustment … . ” Prabhupāda began, speaking slowly. “Just like we felt a little danger under the regime of Indira Gandhi. Now we have another feeling. This is material adjustment. Material adjustment may be temporarily beneficial, but that is not permanently beneficial.”\nMr. Rajda replied, “Unless there isadhyātmikaadjustment, there cannot be lasting benefit.” Mr. Rajda was obviously acquainted with the Sanskrit Vedic knowledge, and he was also aware of the value of going to see a saintly person.\nPrabhupāda persisted, however, in making the point that people do not really understand spiritual life. He described that the material body is made of different elements, and yet the living being is different than these elements. “Unless we understand this fact,” he said, “which is very nicely explained in theBhagavad-gītā,this material adjustment will never make us happy.”\nMr. Rajda followed Prabhupāda’s point but asserted that a great change had taken place since the elections. “The basic difference,” he said, “is that formerly there was no moral code observed by the rulers.” He was entirely agreeable – or wanted to be – with Śrīla Prabhupāda, yet they were speaking on different levels. Both asserted that spirituality was needed in government, but Mr. Rajda’s political conclusion was that such spiritual reform was now present in his political party.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda, however, continued to speak of people who talk of God yet don’t even know the identity of the soul. He didn’t specify whether this criticism applied to the former or to the present political party, although his remarks seemed to include both. Whoever was not in transcendental knowledge, whoever tried to work in the material field without knowing the difference between spirit and matter, would come to the same inglorious end.\n“No,” said Mr. Rajda, “the last rulers, most of them were Communists. They said religion is opium. They didn’t believe in religion at all.”\n“Therefore,” Prabhupāda said, “they say something, we say something, he says something, you manufacture something. But nobody knows what is reality. That is the difficulty. Unless you know the reality, to suggest and say, ‘I suggest it,’ does not mean that it is a solution. This is going on all over the world.Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum.*The external features, these material features – they are concerned with that. Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence. But they do not know that beyond this, there is another element. Unless you come to that knowledge, there is no question of welfare activities. That knowledge is available in India.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda accepted Mr. Rajda’s visit as sincere and serious, and so he wanted to convince him to fully accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness if he was really serious about introducing principles ofdharmaand morality into government. Realdharmahad to start with an acceptance of self-realization as the all-important goal of life. It could not succeed just by rubber-stamping the government as religious.\n“Now we have got good government,” Śrīla Prabhupāda conceded. “Very nice. Now you should take advantage of the privileges which are there in India. TheBhagavad-gītāis there. If you take directions fromBhagavad-gītā,then the whole human society will be benefited. That you do not know. That is the defect. Even big, big leaders, they profess to be students ofBhagavad-gītā,but they do not know anything, although it is clearly stated. Who is the leader in India who does not knowBhagavad-gītā? Everyone knows. Even Morarji Desai, when he was to be arrested by the leaders of government, he said, ‘Wait, let me finish my reading ofBhagavad-gītā.’ Is it not?”\n“Yes,” replied Mr. Rajda.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “ ‘Let me finish myBhagavad-gītā,then you can harass me.’ ”\nMr. Rajda added that Mr. Desai was also studying theBhagavad-gītāvery minutely while he was in jail.\n“But now,” said Prabhupāda, “he says that ‘Janata is my God.’ Did he not say this recently?” Mr. Rajda admitted that Morarji Desai had stated that, but that he had later clarified it.\n“It is the government’s responsibility to make people God conscious,” Śrīla Prabhupāda argued. “It is a very simple thing. God personally is explaining how to become God conscious. It is a very simple thing:man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.*Even a child can do it, so why not leaders? Then their example should be followed. Why don’t they do this, this God consciousness? Do it seriously. Then everything will be all right. They are defying the existence of God and readingBhagavad-gītā.This is their position.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda explained to Mr. Rajda how he had been propagating the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement virtually alone. For years he had worked in the West, and now he was bringing his movement to India. “Cooperate with us,” he said. “You are so kind; you have come to see me. You have got desire. So let us take it seriously.”\nMr Rajda seemed very moved, and replied, “Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Correct.”\n“It is serious,” said Prabhupāda, “but nobody has taken it seriously.Bhagavad-gītāis popular book. Everyone takes theBhagavad-gītāand says, ‘I am a student ofBhagavad-gītā.’ But if the leaders of a society really set the example, others will follow.”\n“That’s correct,” said Mr. Rajda. “A serious effort should be made. Only lip service will not help. That is correct.” Mr. Rajda reminded Prabhupāda how he had supported the Juhu temple at the time of the attempted demolition.\n“So you have given a great service,” said Prabhupāda. “Now it is not only not demolished, but it is standing there.”\n“It is standing,” affirmed Mr. Rajda, “and a very nice temple.”\nMr. Rajda mentioned the possibility of a meeting between Śrīla Prabhupāda and Morarji Desai. He said it could be arranged if it was convenient for Prabhupāda.\n“My life is dedicated for this purpose,” said Prabhupāda. “It is convenient for me at any time. I am not keeping good health at the moment, yet still I have come. I am just trying, even up to the last moment of my life. If I can deliver some good to these people – that is my determination. What is this life? Life will end today or tomorrow or day after. But if you live just to the point, that is the idea. Otherwise, trees are also living – thousands of years. What is the benefit?”\nMr. Rajda confirmed that the meeting could definitely be arranged. He would see the prime minister and fix up a time.\n“So,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “there’s some Kṛṣṇa’s purpose that you were elected.”\n“It is through His blessings,” said Mr. Rajda.\n“Take advantage of His blessings,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Do some service.”\nBefore leaving, Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke with Mr. and Mrs. Mahadevia. Prabhupāda had one of the devotees purchase a nicesārīand he presented it to Mrs. Mahadevia. “I stayed with you, and this is just my remembrance of thanks, so don’t refuse.” He gave a tape recorder to Mr. Mahadevia, asārīto the Mahādevias’ daughter Priti, and money to their servants. Mrs. Mahadevia was very pleased but she protested, saying it was a traditional duty and a pleasure for them to receive Prabhupāda in their home. Previously Śrīla Prabhupāda had been playing the tape recorder in Mr. Mahadevia’s presence, and Mr. Mahadevia had admired the sound reproduction. Now, when Śrīla Prabhupāda gave him the tape recorder, he protested. “No, Prabhupāda, I was not telling you that you should give me that tape recorder. I was just telling you that it’s a good piece.”\n“No, no,” Prabhupāda insisted, “this is for you. You must keep it.”\nSeeing how the one large room was arranged to facilitate his different activities, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “This is like my room at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. In one corner I am writing, in another corner I am sitting, in another corner I am takingprasādam.” The comparison was odd, since the Rādhā-Dāmodara place was a tiny cell, yet Śrīla Prabhupāda saw them as related: the beginning in Vṛndāvana and the apex in Bombay. In either place, he was the same person, humbly taking a littleprasādam,writing his books, and ambitiously planning for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda discussed with several of his disciples and Dr. Sharma about his daily routine in Bombay. He said he would come down fordarśanaof the Deity and would lecture once a week on Sunday. On special occasions he would see a visitor in his quarters, but rarely. “Generally,” he said, “people come to visit and say, ‘How are you? How are you feeling?’ And he takes a half hour even. So what is the use of wasting time like that, ‘How are you?’ Everyone knows that I am not feeling well.”\n“So they can come to the temple room in the morning,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “If they actually want to see me, I am going there. They can see me for a half hour. And for talking, there is no need of talking, ‘How are you? How are you feeling?’ This is not talking.”\n“Instead,” said Gargamuni Swami, “they can buy some of your books downstairs.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, nodding approvingly. “This is a waste of time. I want to stop this, to answer all these things, ‘How are you?’ ” By saving his time and energy, he said, he could work on his book writing. Devotees assured him that everyone would appreciate this schedule and would be happy that he was working on the Tenth Canto.\n“I think I shall be able to work from today,” Prabhupāda declared. “Now I have got very nice place, full freedom. So there will be no difficulty.”\nThat Prabhupāda would not take any morning walks went without saying. Everyone closely involved with Śrīla Prabhupāda had come to accept a new way of living, with no morning walks and very few classes. Someone suggested that Prabhupāda might like to walk on the roof, but even that seemed to be too difficult.\n“No, one story I can go,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Not now, but I can go. So you are trying so much for my comfort, I do not know whether I shall be able to repay you. But I shall try my best. It is not possible to repay your debt, you are so kind. So I can simply pray to Kṛṣṇa to give His blessings to you, so that you may remain very steady in devotional service and preach His message all over the world. Otherwise, I have no other means. Without your help, I could not do anything. So you are very kind. Kindly continue your cooperation. This is the movement forpara-upakāra[doing good for others]. I have got report from our other temples all over the world – they are doing very nice. Is it not? Other temples outside India, they are doing very nice.” Svarūpa Dāmodara, who had recently come from the West, told about the successful standard of devotional service in the temples there.\nPrabhupāda said he wanted silence so he could do his work, and he told a little story about a woman whose tinkling bracelets disturbed her husband. The husband took one bangle away, but still he was disturbed by the “tink-tink-tink.” He took away another bangle and another, until there was only one left. Then there was no more “tink-tink-tink.” Prabhupāda specifically asked his secretaries not to gather and talk in the outer room. “Remain always one,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “and read books. Then there will be no noise. And as soon as you become two –  ‘tink-tink-tink.’ That I don’t want.”\n“It won’t happen,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “If anyone comes to see me, I will go out of the apartment.”\n“Yes,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “in this way arrange. It should remain always quiet and serene.”\n“These areyourquarters,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “No one else should come.”\n“And we shall arrange for seeing our own men at a time,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “But the principle should be silence. That will be all right. I will be free to work.”\nPrabhupāda continued to appreciate his new situation. The rooms were well ventilated, with plenty of sunlight. Other ISKCON buildings, like the Bhaktivedanta Manor in London, were very good, he said, but in most seasons he couldn’t open the doors or windows, because of the cold. “You have to remain packed up,” he said. “In Detroit and London, you cannot open a window.” But here in Bombay the temperature was ideal, and the area outside Prabhupāda’s window was verdant.\nDays went by, and most devotees in Bombay never got to see Prabhupāda. They were all used to having him come down in the morning and walking with them for an hour on Juhu Beach. And they were used to having him come to greet the Deities, give classes, and givedarśanain the afternoon. He had always been open, especially in India, allowing anyone to see him at almost any time. He had always received them warmly and listened to their problems or questions with great sympathy. So for them not to be able to see him, even while he was living in their midst, was traumatic. Only two or three secretaries stayed with him, and whenever other devotees came into his rooms to see him, they would feel that they were taxing him and would leave at the first opportunity.\nUnexpectedly one morning Śrīla Prabhupāda appeared in the temple room, and the few devotees removed Prabhupāda’s picture from thevyāsāsanaso he could sit down. He hadn’t given any warning that he was coming, and many of the devotees were absent. But the word spread that Prabhupāda was there, and the devotees came running.\nAfter theguru-pūjā ārati,Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke to the assembly of devotees. He said he was sorry that he couldn’t come down more often and that he wanted to cook for all the devotees and serve them. On Sunday, he said, he would cook a feast and invite all the devotees up to his quarters. “I shall come daily to the temple,” he said, “and I shall remain up to eight for ourdarśanaand talks, if there is any comment. Generally every day it will be done. And on Sunday you can fix up some time. I will speak in the evening. And then Kṛṣṇa’s desire, as He likes. But for the time being, this arrangement.”\nPrabhupāda’s humility and his exactly reading the minds of the devotees made them feel ecstatic love for him. Some of them had even been thinking that Prabhupāda had forgotten them and that other things had become more important for him. But now he was reassuring them. Although he appeared to be incapacitated, he was fully reciprocating with his disciples. He was telling them that as they were controlled by him, so he was also controlled by their loving service.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then explained the significance ofguru-pūjā,analyzing some of the words in the song the devotees sang each morning during the ceremony. “So the necessity isprema-bhakti,” he said. “Prema bhakti jāhā hoite avidyā vināśa jāte, divya-jñāna.So what is thatdivya-jñāna?”Prabhupāda explained that it was the duty of theguruto awakendivya-jñāna,or superior knowledge of the self. Because thegururevealsdivya-jñāna,he is worshiped. For the nondevotee,divya-jñānais never manifest, and one thinks of himself in terms of his body – as American, Hindu, or Muslim.\n“So we worship theguru,” said Prabhupāda, “because he gives us superior knowledge. Not this knowledge of how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex life and defend. Generally, the political leaders, the social leaders, they give this knowledge: how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex, how to defend. Theguruhas no business with these things. He hasdivya-jñāna,superior knowledge. That is required. This human form of life is an opportunity to awaken that:divya-jñāna hṛde prokāśito.And if he is kept in darkness about thatdivya-jñāna,then life will be lost. Remember this. It is a very risky life to be once again thrown into the waves of birth and death. We do not know where we will go. It is very serious. Kṛṣṇa consciousness isdivya-jñāna.It is not ordinary knowledge.\n“So you should always remember these words,divya-jñānahṛde prokāśito.And because the spiritual master enlightens withdivya-jñāna,one feels obliged to him.Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo / yasya prasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi.*So thisguru-pūjā isessential, just as the Deity worship is essential. It is not cheap adoration. It is the process of enlightenment, ofdivya-jñāna.Thank you very much.”\nNot only was Prabhupāda reminding his disciples that he hadn’t forgotten them, but he was also reminding them that they should not be absent from theguru-pūjāand worshipful thoughts of the spiritual master, even if he was not able to personally come before them.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda mostly stayed alone in his room, and during the day he would move from one desk to another, either to dictate theBhāgavatam,to takeprasādam,or to speak to guests. He was especially prolific at his writing. Rising at one or two in the morning, he would dictate ninety, a hundred, and occasionally almost two hundred digits on his dictating machine. This was more than he had done in months.\nBut he had little appetite. He could not eat anything heavy, and sometimes he had no appetite even for a cup of milk. Pālikā dāsī and sometimes Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha, a Bengali devotee, were the cooks. Śrīla Prabhupāda liked Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha’sśukta,made fromnīmleaves, eggplant, bitter melon, potato, sweet potato, and yogurt.\nOne morning Śrīla Prabhupāda asked for orange juice, but there were no oranges in the kitchen. Gopīnātha ran to get them, but when he returned, Śrīla Prabhupāda was ringing his bell. Gopīnātha rushed in and told him, “I am just coming. It takes time to make the juice.” After a few minutes, when the juice did not come, Śrīla Prabhupāda began repeatedly ringing his bell. As Gopīnātha at last entered with the juice, Prabhupāda spoke out angrily, “I am sick with no appetite, and when I have a little hunger, then you take hours!” He said he didn’t want the juice, but Gopīnātha put it on the table anyway.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda picked the glass up and drank. “You are serving me so nicely,” he said quietly. “I am always chastising you. When one gets old, he becomes short-tempered.” Gopīnātha had not felt bad about the reprimand, but on these humble words from Śrīla Prabhupāda he felt terrible. Gopīnātha became so emotional that he could hardly speak. Yet he managed, in a choked voice, to say, “Please, Śrīla Prabhupāda, don’t speak like that. I make mistakes, and if you don’t correct them, then who will?”\nThere were many little personal exchanges like this between Śrīla Prabhupāda and his assistants, but sometimes he would be more silent and inward than they had ever seen him before. He would spend time chanting and reading, and only on special occasions would he see a guest.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda agreed to an interview with Mr. Koshi, assistant editor forTheCurrentmagazine. Mr. Koshi’s approach was not reverent but provocative, in search of a lively interview. Prabhupāda was interested in speaking to many people through a magazine article, but he had no interest in flattering the editor or in compromising. Especially of late, as at the Bombaypaṇḍāl,Prabhupāda was speaking in the most plain, direct words. Whoever approached him he informed about Kṛṣṇa and their illusion in not accepting Kṛṣṇa. Mr. Koshi asked Prabhupāda why he had been recognized first in countries other than India.\n“Because they [Indians] are so poor that they cannot purchase diamond,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “But diamond must be there. They are so poor-hearted, their education has been so poorly given, that they cannot understand.”\n“Poorly given?” asked Mr. Koshi.\n“Yes,” replied Prabhupāda. “They are teaching, ‘You are this body. Jump like cats and dogs.’ That’s all. That is nationalism? It is, ‘You are this body. Jump like cats and dogs.’ A group, as a group of crows gather together –caw, caw, caw.That has been taught. Make a group and crow. But you don’t find this wordnationalismin theBhagavad-gītā.These are all borrowed words.”\n“So what is your alternative?” asked Mr. Koshi.\n“We are preaching internationalism,” said Prabhupāda. “Everyone welcome. Come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Here is Christian, Hindu. Here is African, Muhammadan – everything. That is real United Nations. If they were thinking that ‘I am American,’ then why are they after a poor Indian man? Indians are known outside India as poverty-stricken, and that’s a fact. But actually we are not poverty-stricken. If we cultivate our own standard of knowledge,Bhagavad-gītā,then we are the richest. We can give the whole world these gifts.”\nPrabhupāda said it was regrettable that scholars and politicians pretend to be students ofBhagavad-gītāwithout even knowing the difference between the body and the owner of the body. They do not even know the first lessons ofBhagavad-gītā.\n“So what is the solution?” asked Mr. Koshi.\n“Solution!” Prabhupāda shouted. “You learn it!”\n“But they don’t want to do it,” said Mr. Koshi.\n“Then they will go to hell,” said Prabhupāda. “What can be done? If you want to cut your own throat, you can do it. Who can save you? But our duty is to say, ‘Don’t commit suicide.’ ”\nMr. Koshi made a case for drinking tea and coffee; he could not see how such things were sinful. Prabhupāda explained that they were intoxicants.\n“But there are several million like me,” said Mr. Koshi.\n“Millions of zeros does not mean one,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Zero is zero. If there are seven million zeros added together, you cannot make one.”\nMr. Koshi also wanted to ask why Prabhupāda paid so much attention only to Kṛṣṇa, since there were hundreds of gods in the pantheon, but Prabhupāda stopped him short.\nMr. Koshi asked about the brainwashing controversy.\n“There are so many accusations,” said Prabhupāda, “but now it is in the court.”\n“But you don’t require recognition of any court, do you?” asked Mr. Koshi.\n“You require,” replied Prabhupāda laughing. “I don’t require. You require.”\n“Yes, until then,” said Mr. Koshi, “there is doubt.”\n“Because you are after the court,” said Prabhupāda, “after the judges. We are not after anyone. We are after one – Kṛṣṇa. That’s all. We know what our duty is.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda further explained that opposition was coming in America because so many young people were taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. “Young men are taking it,” said Prabhupāda. “They are preaching. They have sacrificed their lives. So they are intelligent persons. They can understand that they should not die. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not an old man’s recreation.”\n“No,” said Mr. Koshi, “but you are responsible for it.”\n“I am not,” said Prabhupāda. “Kṛṣṇa is responsible. I am just distributing. My duty is to distribute. That’s all.”\nMr. Koshi asked Prabhupāda if he was happy with the way his movement had spread, and Prabhupāda replied, “Why shall I not be happy? I am not manufacturing anything. That is not my business.”\nJumping from one topic to another in search of readable magazine copy, Mr. Koshi asked Prabhupāda, “How is your health now?”\n“Not good,” Prabhupāda replied. “Health or no health, it is the outward machine. That doesn’t matter. But if it is a good machine, then it helps. That’s all. Otherwise machine good or bad, it doesn’t matter.”\n“What happens when the machine stops?”\n“If your machine has stopped,” Prabhupāda said, “you take another machine. That’s all. Why shall I be overwhelmed, ‘Oh, machine is going, machine is going’? Therefore, Kṛṣṇa says, ‘You are lamenting for the machine, you nonsense.’ That is not thepaṇḍita’sbusiness.”\nMr. Koshi: “What is your typical day like? What time do you get up, and how do you spend your day?”\n“How can I say?” replied Prabhupāda. “I have got so many things.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa, sensing that the interview had gone about as far as it could profitably go, spoke up. “Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said, “I want to suggest that if he has some further questions, we could try to answer them, and then if there are still unanswered ones … . ”\n“No,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “he has no answer on this spiritual matter. He will ask me some political questions. We have no function in politics.”\nMr. Koshi disregarded the signal from Prabhupāda’s secretary and went on with his questions. “You see,” he said, “when I see a group of young people like these boys here dancing in the street, it is something jarring to my eyes. What is the necessity for the chant?”\n“One man’s food is another man’s poison,” Prabhupāda replied laconically.\n“No, no,” said Mr. Koshi, “there must be a purpose behind it.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “that is the way to spiritual understanding in this age.”\nMr. Koshi asked about illicit sex, and Prabhupāda replied that sex should be used only within marriage, for begetting children.\n“Don’t you think that the children should be given freedom to choose voluntarily?”\n“Do you want to give freedom to your children?” asked Prabhupāda.\n“I am asking you,” said Mr. Koshi.\n“No, no,” said Prabhupāda, “what is the use of giving freedom to a child with a razor? He will cut his throat, that’s all.”\n“But at a later age perhaps.”\n“Later age, yes,” said Prabhupāda. “That is enjoined. When a child is sixteen years old he can do as he likes. Not before that.”\nNow Mr. Koshi was ready to wrap it up. “What is your message to the world?” he asked Prabhupāda.\nPrabhupāda and the devotees laughed. “Again you ask me,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “After readingRāmāyaṇa,you are asking me whose father is Sītā. I have explained already.”\nBefore Mr. Koshi left the room, Prabhupāda requested, “Write nice article.”\n“Don’t worry about that,” Mr. Koshi replied. “It is my job.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda made sure Mr. Koshi tookprasādambefore leaving.\nCertain managerial affairs Prabhupāda would try to avoid, although often to no avail, such as concerning the delays in completing the construction work at Bombay. He could hear the sounds of the work, and sometimes it was noisy, but it was the slowness that perturbed him. Sometimes he would sit silently for hours and then remark to his servant or secretary that he was very upset by the construction delays. “You are sincere workers,” Prabhupāda told the devotees in charge, “but no intelligence. I can see that this construction work is not going on. Am I to close my eyes? I can do that, but I am a sensible man. How can I close my eyes? They are all giving their excuses.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda analyzed the different leaders and, on finding defects in each of them, concluded that they were incompetent to speed up the construction. When Tamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested that maybe they should consult a life member who was expert in construction, Prabhupāda approved. So Mr. Mohatta, an engineer and life member, was brought to see Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nAt that time, the construction company was demanding that all past bills be paid before they would go on with the work. But Śrīla Prabhupāda said he wouldn’t pay any more bills until the work was completed; then all bills would be paid in full. Although some of the devotees were more inclined to pay the company right away, at least partially, so that the work would go on smoothly, Mr. Mohatta at once appreciated Prabhupāda’s reasoning and began dealing with the construction company on that basis. He got results, and Prabhupāda was relieved. Thus, although Prabhupāda was eager to retire fully, he did not feel he could remove himself from ISKCON management yet.\nHe began having the newspapers read to him. Much of the news dealt with the downfall of the Congress party and the reform promises of the Janata party. From time to time Prabhupāda would comment, “These rascals, wherever they go, they create trouble.” One time he commented, “Mandaḥ sumanda-matayaḥ –they have got a conception which is very, very bad. Their religious, social, and political conceptions are all condemned.” Prabhupāda’s conclusion: “What the fools and rascals are doing – that is the newspapers.”\nPrabhupāda directed Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and others to write letters and articles replying to some of the news stories. In one news editorial, the writer criticized formal education as corrupting the minds of children. “Educationists and researchers,” the writer urged, “should look into the question and suggest remedies.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “That means the rascals do not know that godlessness and godless education will be like that. The teachers who are suggesting, they are themselves bad, and they are leading. They do not know what is the defect. You can write to them, ‘You leaders, you do not know what is the cause. This is the cause –harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā/ manorathenāsati dhāvato bahih.Without God consciousness, there cannot be any education, there cannot be any good qualities. You do not know this, and you are simply crying in the wilderness. All the education and its propaganda is to make the world godless, although the most scientific knowledge of God is there in theBhagavad-gītā.’ Write him. Give him a slap: ‘You do not know.’ ”\nAnother article, “One Hundred Million Harijans Pick a New Messiah,” observed the death anniversary of Dr. Amritsar, the former champion of human rights for the untouchable caste. The writer lamented that the untouchables, termed “harijans” by Mahatma Gandhi, were so downtrodden and presented such a baffling problem to the leaders and people of India. Śrīla Prabhupāda asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa to write to the editor, explaining how Kṛṣṇa consciousness uplifts the most fallen. “We shall elevate them to go back to Godhead, whatever they may be,” said Prabhupāda. “The defect was that Gandhi started thisharijanmovement – keeping them where they are and at the same time changing their name by rubber stamp toharijan.That must be failure. Just by artificially giving him money or stamping approval, it won’t change anything. You have to changehim.And they have no plan for that. We should not misuse this wordharijan,which means the personal associate of God.”\nPrabhupāda said that some of the senior devotees should regularly write on topics which he would suggest. More and more they should take up the management, write essays, and give lectures transmitting the arguments he would give them.\n“Now you try to manage the whole world organization, all G.B.C. men,” said Prabhupāda. “Suppose I am not there. Manage very nicely. But not independently to create havoc, but really manage. I am still present, so I will give you direction. Don’t spoil it. We are in a very good, prestigious position. So much hard labor. I started with a very humble condition, and now it has come such an exalted position. You don’t spoil it. That is my request. Increase. That will depend on your character, behavior, and preaching. Everyone was astonished how I started this without any help. My only asset was I was sincere. Everyone knows it. Otherwise, how is it possible?”\nUpendra, who had come to be Śrīla Prabhupāda’s personal servant, was surprised to see how Prabhupāda’s diet had changed. He could no longer cook thekicharīwhich Prabhupāda had previously liked. Often Prabhupāda would not even speak when he wanted something, but would indicate an idea or a desire with a nod of the head, a glance, a flick of the finger, or a sound like “Hmm.”\nFrom his room Prabhupāda heard the routine sounds of the day: the call of the cuckoos and the crows, the hammering of the marble workers, and the more distant car engines, horns, bicycle bells. He could also hear thepūjārī’sbell and the conchshell at eachārati,as well as thekīrtanasandbhajanasin the temple room.\nOne morning while Prabhupāda was talking to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Girirāja, the recording of the “Govinda” song began, signifying, as it did in all the ISKCON temples, that the Deity was now giving morningdarśana.“Kṛṣṇa consciousness is such a nice thing,” said Prabhupāda. “Alone in this world I am struggling, and the so-called intelligent persons, they will not come. They have business. Why? If it is actually beneficial to the human society, why I should try alone? I will go on trying as long as I live. There will be no checking. But what kind of intelligent persons there are? We shall go on playinggovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.People may hear or not hear. We don’t mind.”\nGirirāja had arranged the meeting with Mr. Rajda, and now he had another member of Parliament, Mr. Ram Jethmalani, ready to meet with Śrīla Prabhupāda. Mr. Jethmalani had many doubts, however, and he had admitted to Girirāja that he didn’t know whether Kṛṣṇa really existed or was imaginary. His main interest was in improving the slums. But he was willing to see Śrīla Prabhupāda – who was, after all, theguruof a worldwide movement – for a customary social visit. He would see him and then go on to a “thanksgiving tour” among the members of the Bombay constituency who had voted for him in the recent elections.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s desire was to enlighten the political leaders according to the instructions ofBhagavad-gītā.If that was not possible, then he wanted to elicit their help, such as in arranging special visas for foreign devotees and mediating local problems between the Bombay temple and the municipal bureaucracy.\nGirirāja introduced Śrīla Prabhupāda to Mr. Jethmalani, and when Prabhupāda heard of the man’s interest in improving slum conditions, he replied, “So we can uplift the position of theharijansvery easily by this process of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.” He described Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda as the originators of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. And the purpose of Their movement, he said, was to alleviate the suffering of all the sinful people by giving them the Hare Kṛṣṇamantra.But for such a claim, Prabhupāda said, there must be evidence. “You are a lawyer,” he nodded congenially to his guest. “So you want witness and evidence.”\n“You don’t blame me,” agreed Mr. Jethmalani.\n“No, it is not blaming,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “It is a fact. Without evidence, without proof, how can a law be established?” Prabhupāda cited his evidence in a song by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, which told of two great sinners, Jagāi and Mādhāi, who had been saved by the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. That was five hundred years ago, Prabhupāda said, but today one could see practically in the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement how drunkards and illicit sex hunters had become saintly. “Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice,” he said. “Everyone can be elevated. So what is thisharijan? We can uplift them.” Mr. Jethmalani asked why there was no emphasis in theBhagavad-gītāon public and social service.\n“There is no need,” said Prabhupāda. “This is animal conception of life. The dogs also combine together and make a sound,ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.A human being can also do like that. But then what is the difference between animals and human beings?”\n“But I don’t know that animals, on the contrary, serve each other,” said Mr. Jethmalani. “It is men who do.”\n“But what is the use of serving?” Prabhupāda asked. “What you can do? What service you have done? You cannot do anything beyond the laws of nature. Now Indira is in difficulty. What can you do? In one day, everything is finished. The law of nature is so strict. You cannot do anything. You are falsely proud that you want to help, but it is not possible.Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni.*You can only do this service of understanding you are not this body but you are spirit soul. Your business is this. This isdharma.”\nMr. Jethmalani protested that nevertheless there was so much physical suffering around. Prabhupāda agreed that it was good to be sympathetic, but one had to actually do something to rectify the suffering. “So you must know first of all how suffering can be stopped,” said Prabhupāda. “Then you do this, the needful. Otherwise, what is the use if you do not know the method?Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam.*I think you have read theBhagavad-gītā?”\nMr. Jethmalani said he had. He could not understand yet exactly how theBhagavad-gītācould be so practical, but he was listening respectfully to Śrīla Prabhupāda and appreciating his staunch conviction. But after a few minutes, he prepared to leave. “Anyway,” he said, “I will be in touch with your Girirāja.”\nPrabhupāda continued preaching and simultaneously asked thatprasādambe brought for Mr. Jethmalani.\n“Sir,” said Mr. Jethmalani, “I will take leave of you, and with your blessings. I hope we shall soon be —”\n“We are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness without any sectarian motive,” said Prabhupāda. “This is unity on the spiritual platform. Try to understand.” Mr. Jethmalani said he hoped that he could be of some use to Prabhupāda’s movement.\n“Yes,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “that is required – that you want to cooperate.”\n“Whatever you order at any time,” said Mr. Jethmalani.\n“So inform him,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “and bringprasādam.”\nAt first Mr. Jethmalani said he would prefer that theprasādambe brought down to his car so that he could hurry and get to the public meeting on time. But Prabhupāda insisted; that was no way to honor the Lord’sprasādam.“Kindly wait,” he asked. Mr. Jethmalani said he did not want to eat in Prabhupāda’s presence, but Prabhupāda insisted and explained that this was an exchange of love. Finally, when the full plates ofprasādamwere brought in, Mr. Jethmalani was very appreciative. He had been so busy that he had not eaten all day, and he found theprasādamvery tasteful.\n“This is the real human service,” said Prabhupāda, watching with pleasure as his guest began to eat, “ – to give them knowledge.” Mr. Jethmalani became more relaxed and friendly, inquiring about Prabhupāda’s daily routine and about different aspects of how Westerners had taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nGirirāja mentioned that earlier Mr. Jethmalani had been questioning whether Kṛṣṇa had an actual existence or whether He was imaginary.\n“Why imaginary?” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “He’s in the history,Mahābhārata.” Prabhupāda continued to give historical evidence of Kṛṣṇa from theśāstras,and Mr. Jethmalani listened submissively while continuing to eat. In due course, sweets were brought.\n“In Northern India,” said Prabhupāda, “first of all they give sweets. So they eat sweets to the heart’s content.”\n“The best way to destroy your appetite is to eat sweets first,” said Mr. Jethmalani.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, and they both laughed.\n“So I am very glad that you have taken theprasādam,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “I am pleased. Therefore, I wanted that you eat before me. It is a great pleasure.”\nOn the best of terms, Prabhupāda and his guest parted, with Mr. Jethmalani promising he would confer with Girirāja about any problems. Girirāja was ecstatic. His dream of Prabhupāda at the Bombay temple, transforming lionlike politicians into gentle devotees, was being fulfilled.\n“Yes, you have done everything. Still, we want the wholeBhāgavatam,Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\n“That will be done,” said Prabhupāda. “Even it is not full, there is no loss. You are competent. You can take charge. Now you can take charge of all the money, and let me remain free from management. My only request is, don’t spoil it. I have sometimes chastised so that it may not be spoiled.”\nPrabhupāda said that for him to see that things were going on nicely under his ISKCON leaders would make him happy. “And I will go on writing books. That will be all right?” He said there was no need for him to eat anymore. Since he was not physically active, there was no purpose in taking a lunch ofcapātīsand rice.\nGirirāja expressed that it was the pleasure of Prabhupāda’s devotees to see him eat and relishprasādam.But Śrīla Prabhupāda disregarded this and said the brain could be kept active just by a little fruit or milk.\nThese moods – Prabhupāda speaking of retirement and fasting, even hinting of passing away – were only occasional moods. They were very real, practical, and sober, but he would soon turn to other things, promising his continual involvement with his disciples, his movement, and the world. After a brief spell of such talking, he would again be commenting fiercely on the follies of the scientists and politicians.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that if a man could not accept the simple logic that there must be God, then he was obstinate and not even sane. “But these animals,” he said, “they are passing on as big scientists, philosophers, theologians, and so on and so forth. We have to stop them.Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāh prapadyante narādhamāh.This is the qualification of the person who does not accept God. He is eitherduṣkṛtina, narādhama, mūḍha,ormāyayāpahṛta-jñāna.Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāmeans those who are highly educated but have no knowledge.Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥmeans they do not believe that God exists. So as Kṛṣṇa conscious leaders, you have to chastise these rascals.”\nGirirāja said, “It’s actually relishable to chastise them.”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda laughed. “It is a pleasure sport.” As they spoke, Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha entered with the daily newspaper. “What is the news?” Prabhupāda asked. “What are all these rascals saying? Newspaper means all the statements of rascals.”\nGopīnātha read the headlines aloud: “Honest Plea to Congress Chief Minister … Mischief Calls for Assembly Election.”\n“Again elections,” said Prabhupāda. “As if election will change their quality. Let them remain rascals and simply by election replace one rascal with another rascal. Let them remain rascal but get votes. That is described inBhāgavatam:śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ.*The population isśva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra,and they are giving vote, another bigpaśu[animal]. Yes, this is democracy. The voters arepaśus,or beasts, and they are selecting another bigpaśu.This is going on. The rascals do not know that if instead of a tiger we select a lion, then what is the difference? Simply names. The tiger was president. Now the lion is president. And both of them are animals. Where is theman,the human being? This is going on. And because they arepaśu,they say, ‘Oh, now there is lion. Now the tiger is driven away. Now there is lion.’ This is going on. Am I right?”\nPrabhupāda said that temple living was forbrahmacārīsandsannyāsīs.If agṛhasthawas rendering essential service, the temple could provide an apartment for him. “But why salary?” asked Prabhupāda. “Where is the question of salary? Where isvairāgya,renunciation? Salary project should be stopped. If they want salary, they can work outside. In the name of Vaiṣṇava, he is drawing salary, living comfortably, having sense enjoyment. So all you, my officers, should think it over and do the needful.”\nPrabhupāda told how Lord Caitanya was living in the perfect situation in family life with His wife and mother, and yet He left it all to practicevairāgya.And thus He was praised by Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, “You are the Supreme Person, appearing as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, and You are teaching renunciation and devotional service.”\n“But that is not respectful,” said Prabhupāda. “Then he does not know how to honor a saintly person. Useless to meet. If he has no respect for a saintly person, if he thinks he is greater than a saintly person, then the visit is useless.”\n“Yes, then the meeting will start on the wrong foot,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “He has to come see you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There are so many examples in theśāstraof big personalities coming to see saintly persons.”\n“Even Caitanya Mahāprabhurefusedto see the king of Orissa,” said Prabhupāda, “what to speak of going there.” Prabhupāda explained that he did not require anything from the prime minister, but for the benefit of the human society he could suggest some things to him. He said that it was a fact that sometimes, when in difficulty, a saintly person could approach a king. He gave the example of Lord Caitanya’s devotee Gopīnātha Paṭṭanāyaka, and how the devotees asked Lord Caitanya to intervene to save him. But Lord Caitanya showed that it was a difficult job to approach such royal persons. With these guidelines in mind, Girirāja pursued the idea of a meeting.\nOn the evening of May 5 at about midnight, Girirāja received a phone call from Mr. Rajda; the meeting with Morarji Desai was fixed for seven-thirty the next morning. The prime minister was only going to be in Bombay for one or two days and would be staying at his son’s flat on Marine Drive. Although Girirāja knew that Prabhupāda had said he would not go to Mr. Desai, Girirāja wanted to consult Prabhupāda to see if certain leading disciples should go. Not wanting to disturb Prabhupāda, he tiptoed into Prabhupāda’s hallway and peeked into the room. Prabhupāda was awake, sitting at his translating table, working. He looked up, saw Girirāja, and motioned him to come forward.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Girirāja, “I am very sorry to disturb you at this hour, but I just received a phone call from Ratan Singh Rajda.” Girirāja related that Morarji Desai was ready to meet them at his residence the next morning. Śrīla Prabhupāda explained that he wanted to see if Morarji Desai would have been willing to come and meet him at Hare Krishna Land. “It’s not that I’m proud,” he said, “that I can’t go meet him at his place. But unless his mood is respectful, there is no use.” Prabhupāda said that this was the test of whether the prime minister had a proper attitude. He agreed that Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami and Girirāja should go ahead and meet the prime minister.\nGirirāja:This meeting with Śrīla Prabhupāda was one of the most intense and unique that I ever had, although I was able to be in his presence so many times. We were alone together, at midnight. Everyone else was asleep. All the lights were out, and it was just the two of us in this big room. He was sitting behind his marble translating desk, and I was sitting on the floor at his feet.\nI said, “Prabhupāda, I am sorry that I had to disturb you like this in the middle of the night.” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “That’s all right. Actually, with this sickness I cannot sleep at night. Even if I want to, I cannot sleep. Due to this illness, I cannot eat also. I am such an old man. There is no question of sex life and there is no question of defense either, so I guess I am liberated.”\nOf course, I knew that Śrīla Prabhupāda was liberated, not because of bodily circumstances, as he was humbly saying, but because he was in transcendental consciousness. He was always up at night, translating, not because he was sick and couldn’t sleep, but out of devotion to his Guru Mahārāja and to Lord Kṛṣṇa. But it was a very wry, humorous remark, and I felt very charmed by the whole meeting and offered my obeisances and went back to sleep.\nThe next morning, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami and Girirāja were prepared well in advance for their meeting with the prime minister. Before leaving, they asked Prabhupāda what books they should give him. Prabhupāda replied, “Bhagavad-gītā,Kṛṣṇabook, andTeachings of Lord Caitanya.”\n“In Hindi?” asked Girirāja.\nPrabhupāda frowned. “No, English.”\nThe devotees went in their car to pick up Mr. Rajda at his flat; from there they would go to the apartment on Marine Drive where Prime Minister Desai was staying. After Girirāja had been ringing the front doorbell for about twenty minutes, Mr. Rajda finally appeared. He said that they had to wait just five more minutes, while he continued dressing and eating. Unfortunately, by the time they reached the apartment on Marine Drive, it was eight o’clock. They were thirty minutes late! As soon as they entered, the prime minister said, “You are very late.” He was already meeting with some other people and said that he would see the devotees for a few minutes. He repeated that he had been waiting since 7:25. The devotees remained silent, not knowing what to say. They apologized and gave him Prabhupāda’s books. Mr. Desai didn’t say much and quickly excused himself, going back to his meeting with the others.\nWhen the devotees returned to the temple, Prabhupāda eagerly asked what happened. He was very upset to hear that they had been late. “Very bad,” he said. He remarked that Morarji Desai was known for his punctuality. They had missed a good opportunity, he said, by their misbehavior. When the devotees explained that Mr. Rajda had made them late, Prabhupāda asked for a more detailed report. The devotees said the main thing Morarji Desai wanted to know was why they were late.\n“Did you tell him that Ratan Singh Rajda made you late?” asked Prabhupāda.\nGirirāja and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa shook their heads. Prabhupāda became disgusted and said, “Why did you not say that he made you late? That you were on time, but he made you late? I know you are thinking that he is our friend and you didn’t want to embarrass him in front of the prime minister, but now the whole thing is spoiled.” Feeling very foolish and ashamed, the devotees sat silently before Prabhupāda. Śrīla Prabhupāda reflected for a moment. “Anyway,” he said, “these men will never change their views.”\n“You should take care of your health,” said Sriman Narayan. “I hope you get better.”\n“Oh, this is just an old machine,” Prabhupāda laughed. “The more you cure it, the more it gets worse. But my work never stops. That keeps on going. My main work is to write these books, and that is going on.” Several other Indian guests were present, and they at once began recommending good places for health: Srinagar, Kashmir, Dehradun, Masouri, Simla, Hardwar.\n“Yes, the water in Hardwar is good,” said Sriman Narayan, “but better than that would be in Hrsikesha, where the Ganges flows. Whatever places are on the bank of the Ganges, the water will be very good. Pure Ganges water.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda took these remarks seriously and turned to his disciples. “Yes, then we can go to Hrsikesha. This time is very good. Let us arrange for that.”\nFrom that moment, going to Hrsikesha became a definite plan, and Prabhupāda prepared to leave Bombay within a week."

        "content": "THE FIRST WEEK in Hrsikesha was idyllic, heavenly, with perfect weather and hopes of Prabhupāda eating and recovering. But on the eighth night, a violent storm hit, and with the storm came a drastic turn in Prabhupāda’s health. He said the end was near, and he asked to go immediately to Vṛndāvana, in case Kṛṣṇa wanted him to depart from the world very soon.\nThe devotees in Hrsikesha had been in high spirits, and so had Śrīla Prabhupāda. While crossing the Ganges by boat, Prabhupāda had requested drinking water to be fetched from the center of the river. He had liked the lodge provided by his host, and he had even gone into the kitchen to show his disciples how to cook. Word had spread through the pilgrimage-tourist town that A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami was present, and Prabhupāda had agreed to hold adarśanafrom five to six P.M. daily. The room had always been crowded at that hour with forty to fifty people, including Western hippies and seekers as well as Indians on pilgrimage or vacation. Although Śrīla Prabhupāda’s voice had been extremely faint, he had spoken with force, stressingBhagavad-gītāas it is.\nWhen an American hippie had questioned him skeptically, Prabhupāda had replied, “You cannot understand, because you are crazy.” And when a lady had put forward materialistic welfare work as the highest good, Prabhupāda had replied, “Your compassion is as valuable as blowing on a boil to heal it.”\nOnly a few disciples were with Prabhupāda in Hrsikesha, and they had deemed it a wonderful treat. Not only had Prabhupāda directed the cooking, but he had told stories while cooking. He had said that only a lazy man couldn’t cook, and then he told a Bengali story – the story of a lazy man – to illustrate. There was a king who decided that all lazy men in his kingdom could come to the charity house and be fed. So many men came, all claiming, “I am a lazy man.” The king then told his minister to set fire to the charity house, and all but two men ran out of the burning building. One of the two said, “My back is becoming very hot from the fire.” And the other advised, “Just turn over to the other side.” The king then said, “These are actually lazy men. Feed them.”\nBut on the evening of May 15, Śrīla Prabhupāda could neither sleep nor work at his dictation. The storm, a harbinger of the monsoon season, knocked out all electric power in Hrsikesha. Since the fans were not running and the window shutters had to be closed because of the wind, the room became very hot.\nAt five in the morning Śrīla Prabhupāda called for Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami and said he was feeling weak. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa massaged Prabhupāda for an hour. Even at dawn the wind did not let up, and sand was blowing.\nThe storm and power failure continued the next night. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked Prabhupāda about the swelling in his hands and feet, and Prabhupāda replied, annoyed, “Why you are bothering? It is my body, and I am not disturbed.” But then he added, “From the material point of view, it is not good. Please consider how everything may be turned over to the G.B.C., so that in my absence everything will go on. You may make a will, and I will sign it.” He was talking definitely about things that before he had only alluded to.\nSuddenly, at one-thirty A.M., Prabhupāda rang his bell, and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha responded. From beneath his mosquito net, he said, “As I was telling you, the symptoms are not good. I want to leave immediately for Vṛndāvana.” If it was time for him to pass away, he said, then let it be in Vṛndāvana. Since he wanted to leave immediately, the devotees stayed up all night, packing and preparing to leave. Train reservations were not available, however, so they decided to go by car.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda rode in the back seat of the small Ambassador, sometimes stretching out on the seat. Upendra sat at his feet on the floor, while Tamāla Kṛṣṇa sat in the front next to Dāmodara Paṇḍita, an experienced driver who drove fast but with utmost care. Often Dāmodara Paṇḍita would glance into the rear-view mirror and meet Śrīla Prabhupāda’s attentive gaze. At one point, when Prabhupāda saw a man selling cucumbers, he asked Dāmodara to stop the car. Cucumbers, he said, were good for quenching thirst.\nAfter four and a half hours they reached Delhi and stopped at the ISKCON center in Lajpat Nagar. It was very hot. The devotees watered down the roof, and Śrīla Prabhupāda rested there on a cot.\nBy five the next morning they were ready to set out for Vṛndāvana. At the Delhi temple, the devotees had given Prabhupāda a large plate of the Deities’prasādam,but he had only taken a few tastes. “Eating is finished,” he had said. “I prayed to Kṛṣṇa to be freed from eating and sleeping, and it is happening. I have already given up mating and defending. Now all these material activities are finished with.”\nAs they drove out of the city and into the countryside, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa noticed that Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed more peaceful. “You look very happy to be going to Vṛndāvana,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied, “Vṛndāvana is my home, and Bombay is my office.”\nAs they turned off the Delhi – Agra Road, Śrīla Prabhupāda saw for the first time the stone marker, “Bhaktivedanta Swami Marg.” They soon met up with Guṇārṇava, who was waiting on a motorcycle and who joyfully sped ahead to tell the devotees at the Krishna-Balaram Mandir that Śrīla Prabhupāda was here. At the gate of the temple a bigkīrtanaparty, including all thegurukulachildren, was gathered to greet Prabhupāda with chanting and dancing. Four devotees carried Prabhupāda on a palanquin to the temple hall, where he offered his respects to the two Lords, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. After theāraticeremony honoring Śrīla Prabhupāda, Prabhupāda spoke briefly to the assembled devotees.\n“If death takes place,” he said, “let it take place here.” Seeing his demeanor and hearing him speak these unexpected words, some of the devotees in the room began to cry. “So,” he continued, “there is nothing to be said new. Whatever I have to say, I have spoken in my books. Now, try to understand it and continue your endeavors. Whether I am present or not present, it doesn’t matter. As Kṛṣṇa is living eternally, similarly, the living being also lives eternally, butkīrtir yasya sa jīvati.One who has done service to the Lord lives forever. So, you have been taught to serve Kṛṣṇa. So with Kṛṣṇa, our life is eternal. The temporary disappearance of this body – it doesn’t matter. The body is meant for disappearance. So live forever by serving Kṛṣṇa.”\nDespite the finality of these words, Śrīla Prabhupāda continued to converse in his room with a few guests who remained after most of the devotees had left. A retired family man, a Mr. Bose, was present and told Prabhupāda how he was now living alone in the Krishna-Balaram Mandir. Prabhupāda said, “You will not be able to adjust to this way of life.” But when Mr. Bose expressed his determination, Prabhupāda added, “You have a very good family, so it is hopeful.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda went on to recall some of his activities at Hrsikesha, and he spoke of how his movement was growing stronger around the world and how in New York the judge had made a very favorable decision.\nA little later, the conversation turned to ghosts, and Prabhupāda told about the haunted house of Lokanath Mullik in Calcutta. Prabhupāda had also rented a “ghost house” in Lucknow. “I am not afraid of ghosts,” he said. “I am ghostproof. In England there are also many ghosts. They are generally evil, and sometimes they even kill. They can be seen sometimes entering a latrine or sitting on a pillar. By offeringpiṇḍaone can free his forefathers from ghostly bodies. In Māyāpur there were Muhammadan ghosts, but not anymore. By our chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa ghosts are driven away.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was still prone to become involved in management, and he asked his secretary to report to him on the various ISKCON activities. “You become my eyes,” he said. But to think that the Bombay project was not yet completed disturbed him very much. “I have worked so far to get done whatever is accomplished,” he told Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “Now if the Deities are not properly installed in my presence, it will be a great shock.” But ISKCON management was too much botheration, and Prabhupāda told Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “You must give me complete relief from management.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa mentioned that Prabhupāda would sometimes become upset if he was not informed about ISKCON management, but Prabhupāda said better not to inform him. “Now take it that I am dead,” he said. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa took this remark to mean that the leaders of ISKCON should manage all problems just as if Prabhupāda were no longer present. They should relieve him so he would be free to think of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. And Prabhupāda confirmed that this was the right idea. “Give me that chance,” he said.\nAfter one day in Vṛndāvana, Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote,\nSeeing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mood, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa mentioned the need for a will, and Prabhupāda agreed. A will, he said, was simple enough. Whatever he spoke, several men could sign as witnesses. He recalled how his spiritual master, just before a hernia operation, had made a very simple will on a scrap of paper. Although he never underwent that operation, years later the same will was presented in court and was accepted as evidence against the plots of some of the disciples.\n“He was the original founder,” said Prabhupāda, “so whatever he wills, that is accepted.” When Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked why Prabhupāda’s Guru Mahārāja had not undergone the operation, Prabhupāda replied, “Everyone has their sentiment. He thought that the doctor was paid to kill him.”\n“Yes,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “because sometimes people were actually paid off to kill him. Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you and your Guru Mahārāja were the greatest enemies of modern civilization in this century.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda explained, “This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mission.Bhārata-bhūmite haila … .This is India’s culture. The whole world is in darkness, and they are risking their life in the transmigration of one body to another. He does not know that he is eternal and that in a few years this fragment is passing away, this life is just a passing flash. This is the Vaiṣṇava’s concern. What these rascals are doing? They are jumping like monkeys, wasting time. That is the Vaiṣṇava’s compassion,para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.”\nWhen some other devotees gathered in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa explained Prabhupāda’s recent decision. “So Śrīla Prabhupāda has decided that the best medicine would beŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamandkīrtana,and no need of any doctors who have promised to help save the life. We shouldn’t bring them. And no outsiders.”\n“No medicine for the body?” asked a devotee.\n“Oh, whatever medicine I am taking,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “Yogendra Ras.”\n“He has tried so many medicines,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said. “Every doctor has come, and they have each given their medicine. And he has tried them. This medicine always works:Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamandkīrtana.”\n“Bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-’bhirāmāt,” quoted Śrīla Prabhupāda. (He had been quoting it again and again.) “It pleases the ear and the mind,bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-’bhirāmāt, ka uttama-śloka-guṇānuvādāt.Make glorification of Bhagavān, and everyone will appreciate it – except the animal.”\nAt Śrīla Prabhupāda’s request,kīrtanasby a group of no more than four or five devotees andBhāgavatamreadings went on constantly, whether he was in his room, on the veranda, or on the roof. In the morning from five to ten and in the evenings from three to nine he would sit with his eyes closed, absorbed in thekīrtana,“the medicine for the disease of material existence, which gives pleasure to the mind and ear.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa promised to Prabhupāda he would read him no letters and bring him no visitors. Prabhupāda had long wanted this, and now it at least would come to pass.\nThe writing of the will would not be done with the attitude that the end had come, but in the spirit of “preparing for the worst.” It also meant finishing things so they would not have to be done at the last minute. Prabhupāda was concerned that his movement continue securely, with all ISKCON properties in the possession of his disciples within the institution and all his instructions made clear for the future. These matters should be dispatched now in a will, and the G.B.C. men should gather in Vṛndāvana to make these last arrangements and to be with him. Once these things were settled, Prabhupāda would be free to continue writing his books with no worries.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa later asked Śrīla Prabhupāda whether his new decisions indicated that he was losing his desire to fight to live. Śrīla Prabhupāda indirectly admitted it was so. “Therefore,” he said, “I do not wish to leave Vṛndāvana. If, by Kṛṣṇa’s desire, I survive, then we shall see later on. Otherwise … . ”\nEven though his secretary did not read him letters or bring him news, Prabhupāda went on thinking. “What about the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple?” he asked. He had been renting his rooms there for years, and the temple proprietors had often challenged his rights. This was just another of his multifarious worries in maintaining his preaching around the world. Prabhupāda advised that his disciples always live in the Rādhā-Dāmodara rooms; that would prevent the landlord from trying to use them for something else. Even while lying quietly, resting, Prabhupāda would turn over such problems in his mind.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa wanted to double check to see that Prabhupāda actually wanted all the G.B.C. men from all over the world to come. It would be costly and demanding, so he wanted to be sure that Prabhupāda really wanted it. When Śrīla Prabhupāda assured him that he did, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, who saw his service as responding to whatever Śrīla Prabhupāda desired, also spoke in favor of the idea.\n“Because they love you,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “I am sure they will all want to come and be with you.”\n“Your love for me,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “will be shown by how much you cooperate to keep this institution together after I am gone.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda would usually make comments such as this while lying in bed. As soon as he would speak, some of the devotees attending him would come close to catch his words, and sometimes thekīrtanawould stop.\nThe parts of Prabhupāda’s daily schedule that remained the same as before were his rising in the middle of the night to translateŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,his morning massage and bathing, and his hearing news through his secretary. He had all but stopped his morning car ride, as well as hisdarśanaofthe Deities. Eating was almost nil. He asked to be moved from his bed downstairs to the one upstairs, and sometimes he would sit at his desk.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa read Prabhupāda a letter from Girirāja, more like a loving prayer than a letter. Girirāja had quoted a verse by Prahlāda Mahārāja fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam:\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was very affectionate toward Girirāja for his faithful, fearless service, and he listened with great appreciation, closing his eyes and drinking in every word of the prayer.\nThat same evening, Śrīla Prabhupāda sat up to receive a member of Parliament, Sri Sitaram Singh. Although he was appreciative that a highly placed man was visiting, he spoke on the absolute plane, exposing material illusions. Immediately, he attacked the narrow-mindedness of politicians with their party politics. He also exposed the rascaldom of politicians who claimed to support nonviolence on the basis of theBhagavad-gītā.At times like this, the devotees with Śrīla Prabhupāda would almost forget that he was making preparations for the end of life. Later that night, afterMr. Singh had left, Prabhupāda said, “I can speak some more, or if Kṛṣṇa desires, then whatever I have given already, that is all.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was unlimitedly willing to speak about Kṛṣṇa and to help give Kṛṣṇa consciousness to others. But how much longer he would stay, how much more he would give, was up to Kṛṣṇa. With more time, he would carry on Kṛṣṇa’s will in the material world. But if Kṛṣṇa’s desire was that he should leave, then he would also accept that willingly. Even if he had to soon depart from this world, he could not simply shut off his burning compassion, his preaching spirit. Most of all, he desired that what he had started – a worldwide movement to save suffering souls –  should continue.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami confided to his Godbrothers that his own feelings were mixed. It was a time of sorrow, and yet Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed relieved now that he had decided not to struggle to survive. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said he couldn’t but feel happy at Śrīla Prabhupāda’s relief from all concerns. Bhavānanda Goswami, one of the first G.B.C. men to arrive, told the others how he had said to Prabhupāda that on the one hand he felt sad that Prabhupāda was departing, but also joyful that he would be able to leave this nasty material world and rejoin Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda had approved the sentiment, adding that although his Guru Mahārāja had become disgusted at the end of his life due to the misbehavior of his leading disciples, he did not feel that; rather, he liked the company of his disciples and felt they were doing their best in carrying out his order. But he also warned them not to spoil ISKCON and become another Gaudiya Math by splitting up.\nThe ISKCON leaders formed small groups and took turns in being with Prabhupāda and chanting and reading to him. He would often be sitting up in bed in his main room downstairs, and the high-ceilinged room with its black stone floor would be very dimly lit, though decorated with flowers and framed pictures of ISKCON Deities. His room was comfortable, despite the oppressive heat, because of the air cooler and overhead fans.\nSometimes Prabhupāda would clap his hands softly to thekīrtana,and he was always ready to hear and evaluate reports of his disciples’ preaching. The main difference about Prabhupāda was his physical appearance. As one G.B.C. man put it, he looked like one of the great ascetics depicted in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,grown extremely thin like Dhruva Mahārāja or Rantideva, who performed great austerities while rapt in meditation on the Absolute Truth.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda would alternately sit up in bed or lie down while hearingkīrtanaorŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Now he was always surrounded by concerned disciples and he seemed happier. Some of the devotees who had been with him in Vṛndāvana just before all the G.B.C. secretaries had arrived could see that he felt more encouraged; perhaps by the sincere prayers of all the devotees a dramatic change might come.\nBhavānanda Goswami and Jayapatāka Swami brought reports from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s beloved Māyāpur project. Bhavānanda said the temple was filled with transcendental activity, and thegurukulaboys would chant Hare Kṛṣṇa even while sweeping the roads. Work was just beginning on a new residence for Śrīla Prabhupāda; it would be surrounded by fountains, a terrace, and a big pond.\n“It has not yet begun?” Śrīla Prabhupāda asked. Jayapatāka Swami replied that the plans had been drawn and that the architects said it would be no problem. They could build right through the rainy season.\n“How long will it take?” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s behalf.\n“Six months.”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “I think you are tied to this planet by the love of your devotees.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda uttered a thoughtful “Hmmm. All right.”\nAlthough Śrīla Prabhupāda had indicated a will to live by saying, “All right,” to Bhavānanda he said, “There is no hope of life. Therefore I have called the G.B.C. If I can die in Vṛndāvana … . Kṛṣṇa can accomplish anything, but from the physical condition there is no hope.”\n“But Kṛṣṇa is Parameśvara,” Bhavānanda said.\nPrabhupāda laughed. “That is another thing.” If Kṛṣṇa liked, then he would live. But Prabhupāda wanted his disciples to understand the critical state of his health. “The brain is working,” he said, “but the body is not allowing. Don’t worry. Everyone will die today or tomorrow. I am also an old man. There is nothing to be regretted. It is up to Kṛṣṇa.”\nDropping his reassuring stance and pleading as a helpless student, Bhavānanda asked, “What can we do, Śrīla Prabhupāda?”\n“You can pray to Kṛṣṇa,” Prabhupāda replied. “Kṛṣṇa is all-powerful. And one of the most important things is that when I am gone, don’t spoil it. Keep it, Māyāpur.”\nJayapatāka Swami gave glowing accounts of his recent preaching to both Hindus and Muslims in Dacca. “There have been nosādhusin Bangladesh for years,” said Jayapatāka, speaking strongly and victoriously, though sitting like a child at the foot of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s bed. “People are eager to hear about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Ten thousand people gathered. It was the biggest function in the history of the colony, either Hindu or Muhammadan. The Muhammadans are also interested. They don’t know anything about Lord Caitanya. Many ask if we have any books on the life of Lord Caitanya. They like to read.”\n“That bookTeachings of Lord Caitanya,”Śrīla Prabhupāda interjected in a voice hoarse but full of life and interest.\nJayapatāka said they had prospects of getting a temple there. “Many young men are coming and asking very intelligent questions,” he said. “They ask questions about our Deity worship, aboutguru,abouthari-nāma.Very intelligent questions. There is no CIA rumor. There is no type of any bad talk about us. No envy at all. And because they are a little oppressed, they are always being challenged about believing in Kṛṣṇa – so that is why they are eager to understand.”\n“What about the Muhammadans?” asked Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“At one place,” said Jayapatāka, “when Prabhaviṣṇu lectured in Dacca, a Muhammadan heard and came to him and said, ‘What you are preaching is very applicable to the modern day. In my district there is nearly a majority of Hindus, but when they have theirsādhuscome and preach there, I find it very old-fashioned and very unacceptable. But your preaching we find enthusing.’ So he arranged a program. Ultimately every Muhammadan that I have met has become interested, just because it was presented in a way that was acceptable to them. They say, ‘You are Hindu?’ We say, ‘No, we are Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava means we believe in only one God. There is no one equal to Him. So you believe in the same thing.’ ”\n“That is a fact,” said Prabhupāda. “Asamordhva.There cannot be anyone equal to God or greater than Him.”\n“Many young men, both Hindu and Muhammadan, will join,” said Jayapatāka Swami. “I am sure. But right now we are getting the society registered and getting our place.”\n“You did not get that yet?” Prabhupāda asked. “Get the place and get the society registered.” Prabhupāda added that Jayapatāka should do everything very seriously. “It is increasing,” he added approvingly.\nWhen Rāmeśvara Swami came into the room for hiskīrtana,he brought Śrīla Prabhupāda the newest editions of theKṛṣṇabook trilogies and reported on how the various books were selling.\n“Keep your health very nice,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. “Live as many years as possible. Be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then next life you go back to home – permanent life. There is no cheating, no politics, no personal ambition to fulfill. There is not any tinge of any personal salvation. Now can anyone point out that here is personal sense gratification? Can anyone? Can you say, ‘Here is my personal sense gratification’? There is no such thing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is our desire – that we live with devotees and execute the mission of our predecessors. This is our ambition. Without ambition no one can live. Our real self-interest is to execute Kṛṣṇa’s desire. So do it very carefully, and if one fourth of the Americans become Vaiṣṇavas, then the whole world will change. … ”\n“In America now,” Rāmeśvara said enthusiastically, “the book selling has surpassed last year. We are trying to double. We have not yet doubled, but it has gone beyond last year.”\n“It is going to double,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“By your mercy,” Rāmeśvara added.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “Be doubly blessed.” At these words the devotees laughed happily.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then turned to Kīrtanānanda Swami. “So New Vrindaban is developing. Be happy.”\n“We can’t be happy if you are not there,” Kīrtanānanda said.\n“I am always there,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “When I see that everything is going nicely, then I am happy. Even with this body. Body is body. We’ll have next body.”\n“Wasn’t it Puru who gave his father his youth?” asked Kīrtanānanda.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda nodded. “King Yayāti traded his old age.”\n“And you can do that,” said Kīrtanānanda.\n“No, why?” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “You are my body. Then you can do it. There is no difference. Just like I am working, so my Guru Mahārāja is there, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. Physically he may not be, but in every action we do.”\n“In theBhāgavatam,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “you say that for whoever follows theguru,thegurulives with him eternally.”\n“So I am not going to die,” said Prabhupāda. “Kīrtir yasya sa jīvati.One who does something substantial, he lives forever. He doesn’t die. One has to accept another body according to hiskarma,but for a devotee there is no such thing. He always accepts a body for serving Kṛṣṇa, so there is no problem.”\nRāmeśvara Swami informed Prabhupāda that the last volume of the Ninth Canto was at the printer, and the first volume of the Tenth Canto would follow in two weeks. Śrīla Prabhupāda inquired about whether it was more economical to print the Hindi books in India or America, and they discussed.\n“Internationally all conditioned people are suffering,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “But you devotees are above all dangers. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja knows that very well. He has no danger, sticking to that New Vrindaban program. There is always improvement. They eat first-class nutritious food. And what is that place in Pennsylvania?”\nIt was like old times, with Śrīla Prabhupāda hearing reports and correcting and inspiring his leaders to do more and more, assuring them that Kṛṣṇa would help them.\nRāmeśvara Swami described for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s pleasure the great volume of Kṛṣṇa conscious literature being distributed. “At the end of this year,” he said, “we will have sold at least sixty-five million books on Kṛṣṇa. Every year we are selling at least fifteen to twenty million books now.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “They ask, ‘Why are you stressing so much on Kṛṣṇa?’ But that is the only message. It will increase more. People will be inquisitive.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued to talk, but with occasional reflections on his present condition. “What is the problem?” he asked. “We are talking about Kṛṣṇa. So if all of a sudden I collapse, then what is the problem?Kṛṣṇa tvadīya-pada-paṅkaja … .*Ordinary dying iskapha-vāta-pitta,choking. But if in thekīrtanayou die, oh, it is so successful. Not the injection and operation – that atmosphere. But inkṛṣṇa-kīrtana.That is glorious. Not oxygen, gas, dying, and so much trouble. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa –bas. And let me die, Kṛṣṇa. Never be disturbed. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. For chanting you have got so much material. Now read something from this book.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda reached over and openedŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamand handed it to Rāmeśvara, who began to read.\nOne after another the G.B.C. men arrived. Atreya Ṛṣi brought pomegranates and sweet lemons from Iran, as well as good news of the ISKCON restaurant there. Śrīla Prabhupāda listened with intense interest to Atreya Ṛṣi’s report and then spoke for a while about the Middle East and how to best present Kṛṣṇa consciousness there. Kīrtanānanda Swami had brought milk products from New Vrindaban, and asannyāsīcame from Thailand with fruits and flowers.\nWhen Ādi-keśava Swami came in, Prabhupāda beamed. He heard with great pleasure Ādi-keśava’s report of the impact of the New York court decision on Indians around the world. When Svarūpa Dāmodara arrived he showed Prabhupāda the manuscripts for three pamphlets proving scientifically and mathematically that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the Absolute Truth. After each report and greeting, Śrīla Prabhupāda would ask that thekīrtanabe continued, and he would become silent, as the devotees sang softly, hour after hour: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. A very small pair ofkaratālas,the only instrument, produced a soft, pleasant ringing The voices of the chanters were subdued, but their minds were firmly fixed in devotion to Śrīla Prabhupāda and the holy name, concerned that Prabhupāda could hear themahā-mantrawithout interruption.\nThe devotees who were chanting experienced their own realizations while intimately associating with Śrīla Prabhupāda in this way. They could understand this was a most important connection with Śrīla Prabhupāda, to come into his presence and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa andjaya śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanyaand read to him fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted to hear the transcendental sound, yet he was simultaneously teaching his disciples. After his departure, they would retain the deep impression of the significance of the Hare KṛṣṇamantraandŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and they would go on giving the mercy to others. He was teaching them how to become pure devotees. He was sharing himself with them by having them chant very simply and read his books without speculation, so that later, when preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they would remember. Śrīla Prabhupāda would always be with them as they went on chanting simply and preaching without speculation. Whether he would depart now or later, he was preparing them.\nSometimes during the chanting Śrīla Prabhupāda would communicate unspoken feelings with his disciples. He might simply glance at one of the devotees, but that devotee would feel a surge of loving emotion and realization. Suddenly he would understand better how pure and compassionate Śrīla Prabhupāda was. And the devotee might recall how Śrīla Prabhupāda had come and saved him, bringing him to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus the G.B.C. men, while chanting and becoming purified, were rededicating themselves, hoping that Kṛṣṇa would accept them as surrendered souls. They asked that Kṛṣṇa bless them and make them fit for whatever happened.\n“Do not leave me,” Prabhupāda said at one point.\n“Are you feeling better?” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked.\n“Yes, I am feeling a little better. Go on administering this medicine.” At Śrīla Prabhupāda’s request, the devotees staying with him between 1:30 A.M. read to him fromKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.He would usually be on the roof then, sitting up in bed. A few bare bulbs would light the darkness, and all would be quiet and still except for the sound of the devotee reading. After one such reading, Śrīla Prabhupāda asked Rūpānuga about the preaching in Washington, D.C. Rūpānuga replied briefly, and then he and Balavanta began talking about deprogramming. Then Rūpānuga said he had written “A Prayer to The Higher Authorities,” and asked if he could read it to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nA sannyāsīdisciple read aloud a prayer he had written, petitioning the Supreme Lord for Prabhupāda to live for a hundred years. On hearing this, Śrīla Prabhupāda opened his eyes wide and smiled. But again he pointed out that he was not afraid of death. Wherever he was, he said, he was in Vaikuṇṭha. Especially being in Vṛndāvana and being surrounded by thekīrtanaof his disciples was Vaikuṇṭha.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami told Prabhupāda that he had offered a prayer in the temple that morning while standing before Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Kṛṣṇa has done so many miracles, he said, so it would not be very amazing if He kept Prabhupāda alive. And Balarāma, who was supporting all creation, would not be weakened if He gave Śrīla Prabhupāda a little strength. “In this way,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said, “we may all pray to Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma to save you. We are not very important, but still They may hear.”\n“No,” Prabhupāda said. “You are all pure devotees with no other motives.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda regarded the petitions of his disciples as expressions of sincere affection, not at all improper spiritually. But he pointed out that it was ultimately up to Kṛṣṇa. He had His plan. In any case, Prabhupāda said that he would be all right. He told the story of a sage who blessed different persons in different ways. The sage blessed a prince to live a long life, since after death he would be punished for his sensual life. The sage also blessed an ascetic to die at once, so as to be relieved of the suffering of his austerities and receive his pious rewards. But when asked to bless a pure devotee, the sage said that because the devotee had already obtained the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, his condition would be the same, whether he lived or died.\nPrabhupāda knew, even better than his disciples, that there was much he could do if he remained in the world, but he simply wanted to see what Kṛṣṇa desired. He saw strong evidence, however, that his life was about to end, at least according to the condition of his physical body, and this in itself indicated that Kṛṣṇa’s desire was that he soon leave this world.\nThe G.B.C. men met and decided that aside from Prabhupāda’s will, which would secure the ISKCON properties, and aside from making all the bank accounts within ISKCON secure, there were also a few questions which they should put before Prabhupāda before it was too late. These questions, such as how future disciples would be initiated, would have to be answered; otherwise they would become a source of speculation and havoc after Śrīla Prabhupāda’s departure.\nA selected committee from the G.B.C. came before Śrīla Prabhupāda as he sat up in bed in the main room downstairs. Satsvarūpa dāsa Goswami was to be the spokesman, but he felt shy and uneasy. To come directly before Śrīla Prabhupāda and ask about what should be done after his passing away might seem impertinent.\nBut it was necessary. Śrīla Prabhupāda himself had requested that the G.B.C. come to Vṛndāvana to take care of exactly this kind of business. Besides, for a disciple to feel foolish and awkward before Śrīla Prabhupāda was normal. And certainly the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disciples continuing his movement was so grave that its importance transcended the awkwardness of the moment. Nevertheless, Śrīla Prabhupāda was Śrīla Prabhupāda, and even though apparently invalid, he was as awesome as ever. If he were displeased with the questions, then it would be frightening.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Satsvarūpa, “we were all asked by the rest of the G.B.C. to come to ask some questions. These are the members of the original G.B.C. as you first made it out. Our first question is about the G.B.C. members. We want to know how long should they remain in office?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda spoke slowly and deeply. “They should remain for good. Selected men are chosen, so that they cannot be changed. Rather, if some competent men are found, they should be added.” Śrīla Prabhupāda took the opportunity to recommend that Vasudeva become a G.B.C. member representing Fiji. “Add him,” said Prabhupāda. “But the G.B.C. is not to be changed.”\nSatsvarūpa asked what to do if a G.B.C. member gave up his post, and Prabhupāda said that the G.B.C. body should elect another man.\n“Our next question,” Satsvarūpa proceeded, “concerns initiation in the future, particularly at that time when you are no longer with us. We want to know how a first and second initiation would be conducted.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “I shall recommend some of you. After this is settled up, I shall recommend some of you to act as officiatingācārya.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa interjected, “Is that calledṛtvik ācārya?”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said, “ṛtvik.”\n“Then what is the relationship of that person who gives the initiation?” asked Satsvarūpa.\n“He isguru,” said Prabhupāda.\n“But he does it on your behalf,” said Satsvarūpa.\n“Yes, that is formality. Because in my presence one should not becomeguru.So on my behalf, on my order –āmāra ājñāya guru.He is actuallyguru,but on my order.”\n“So they may also be considered your disciples,” said Satsvarūpa, referring to those persons initiated on Prabhupāda’s behalf by theṛtvik ācārya.\n“They aretheirdisciples,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. Now he was speaking of initiations after his passing away. “They are the disciples of the one who is initiating. And they are my granddisciples. When I order you to becomeguru,you become regularguru,that’s all. And they become the disciples of my disciple.”\nThe G.B.C. members present were satisfied that Śrīla Prabhupāda’s reply to the intricate inquiry was clear and conclusive. Later, he would select “some of you,” and whoever he selected could become an initiatingguru.What he had already described many times throughout his Bhaktivedanta purports was now being implemented: his disciples would becomegurusand accept disciples of their own.\nSatsvarūpa next asked about the BBT. “At present,” he said, “no translated works are to be published without your seeing and approving them. So the question is, is there any system for publishing works in the future, works that you may not see?”\n“That we have to examine expertly,” Prabhupāda replied. He accepted the principle that future works could be translated from Sanskrit, but he cautioned, “But amongst my disciples, I don’t think there are many who can translate properly.”\n“Therefore, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Kīrtanānanda Swami, “we think that you cannot leave us very soon.”\n“I don’twantto,” said Prabhupāda, “but I am obliged. What can I do?”\n“If you don’t want, then Kṛṣṇa won’t want,” said Kīrtanānanda.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda went on to describe the special qualifications for translating Sanskrit Vaiṣṇava literature. It would take a realized soul, he said. “Otherwise, simply by imitating, A-B-C-D, it will not help. My purports are liked by people because it is presented as practical experience. It cannot be done unless one is realized.”\n“It is not a matter of scholarship,” added Bhagavān.\n“Lord Caitanya says,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “āmāra ājñāyaguru.One who can understand the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he can becomeguru.Or one who understands hisguru’sorder inparamparā,he can becomeguru.And therefore I shall select some of you.”\nBy repeating himself, Prabhupāda emphasized his point –hewould select who would beguru.And he also repeated his other point: “So there is no question of changing G.B.C. Rather, one who is competent, he can be selected to add by the vote of G.B.C.”\n“Of course, if someone falls away,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa proposed, “just like in the past G.B.C. men have fallen down …”\n“They should be replaced,” said Prabhupāda. “They must be all idealācārya.In the beginning we have done for working. But now we should be very cautious. Anyone who is deviating, he can be replaced.”\nTheir few questions answered, the G.B.C. men sat silently before Śrīla Prabhupāda, awaiting any further instructions but anxious not to tire him with their presence.\n“So, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “there is a chanting party ready to do somekīrtana.Maybe they can come in?”\nEven while the G.B.C. was gathered to make a thorough draft and make the will legal, Śrīla Prabhupāda received a visit that made him anxious over his ISKCON society. One of the Gosvāmīs of a Vṛndāvana temple visited and praised Śrīla Prabhupāda. But in the course of the conversation, the man asked, “After you, who will take charge of the property?” As soon as the gentleman left, Śrīla Prabhupāda called for Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Bhavānanda also gathered.\n“In India you can understand there is an undercurrent,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“Undercurrent,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa repeated.\n“An undercurrent is going on,” said Prabhupāda, “that after my demise it may be taken away from your hands.”\n“Whew! You understood that from this discussion?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“I understood it long ago,” said Prabhupāda. “How are you going to guard yourselves?” Once again, it was Prabhupāda who had to make them aware of worldly wisdom.\n“You ordered that we form a trust property with life-long trustees,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “Actually this property is the envy of all India. They are the best properties.”\n“They envy our prestige,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “our position –  everything. Everywhere we are first class.”\nFor Śrīla Prabhupāda, a will meant protection for his ISKCON. As Śrīla Prabhupāda had explained, a devotee has not a tinge of self-interest – everything is for Kṛṣṇa. But in his purity he must not be naive. ISKCON was a large, growing organization of properties and monies intended one hundred percent for use in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Prabhupāda called on the G.B.C. to be vigilant.\nWhile his G.B.C. men discussed privately the details of the will, Śrīla Prabhupāda lay in bed, anxiously concerned about ISKCON’s properties. He didn’t attempt to eat, and Upendra had to massage his chest. Later that day, while surrounded by a sweetly chanting group of devotees, he again brought up the threat. “There is a big plot going on,” he began. “They are very troublesome.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa, who knew what Prabhupāda was talking about, said, “This should be done immediately – make a trust property.”\n“This shall be done,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Very nice.” What Prabhupāda was asking was not unusual. But it had to be done soundly, expertly. And that meant Śrīla Prabhupāda would have to do it himself. He wanted no more management, but could his disciples assure him on this point of greatest anxiety, that the institution’s properties and monies would be protected?\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa spoke up to assure Prabhupāda of the G.B.C.’s competence to deal with this. “This shall be done for all the properties,” he said, “but especially here in India.”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Bhavānanda Goswami, “the trustees should be designated.”\n“Trustee without designation,” Prabhupāda replied. “Where is trustee? I have already made one draft of trustees – for the Book Trust. In that style make it.”\n“Yes,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “So we will make up a draft on that style. And after the draft is approved, you can tell us which trustees you want.”\n“Oh, you can select among yourselves,” said Prabhupāda. “Why you are taxing me?”\nWhen Tamāla Kṛṣṇa mentioned that the three places in India – Bombay, Vṛndāvana, and Māyāpur – were the most important, Śrīla Prabhupāda replied, “Everywhere.” Then he added, “Among yourselves there is no strong man. That is the difficulty.”\n“That is a fact,” admitted Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“All my child,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda – a statement of love but not of relief. “And it requires a very strong man. That is lacking. In every minor detail I have to open my mouth. Anyway, whatever you have got, sit down and select trustees, and that format is there. Make it a trust. Among you Rāmeśvara is a little intelligent. Anyway, do your best. Otherwise, there is a very, very big undercurrent. They are waiting for your program.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa assured Prabhupāda that they would immediately have a meeting – “We will discuss these points.”\n“Oh, discussion I have already given you,” said Prabhupāda. “Do it.”\n“What I meant,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “is we will execute it.”\n“All right,” said Prabhupāda. “Don’t delay.”\nAt times like this, it became especially clear that the day was approaching when Prabhupāda’s children would have to grow up and lead, manage, protect, and expand his society on their own. These might well be their last chances to learn directly from him and to be close with him for chanting the holy name and dedicating themselves utterly to carrying out his desires for ISKCON. Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed to be doubting whether his children would rise to the occasion, and that expressed doubt impelled them not to discouragement but to determined action to prove themselves loyal and competent.\nThat evening a G.B.C. committee reported back to Śrīla Prabhupāda that the will had been drafted, with provisions for the protection of all ISKCON properties through specified trustees. Rāmeśvara read the will before Prabhupāda, who made only a few comments.\n“This will make it impossible for anyone to cheat,” said Rāmeśvara.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda agreed, “as far as I can see.” Even regarding matters of utmost concern to him, he sometimes remained quiet. He had directed his G.B.C. men as far as possible, now he mostly wanted the medicine of the holy name. But what they had done was all right, and he was satisfied. As the committee was leaving his room, he softly exclaimed, “Jayafuture directors of ISKCON!” And later, when alone with his servants, he shed tears and said he could now leave peacefully.\nA few days later the final version of the “Declaration of Will” was notarized in the presence of a lawyer. The document began, “The Governing Body Commission (G.B.C.) will be the ultimate managing authority of the entire International Society for Krishna Consciousness,” and went on to cover all the points of concern regarding ISKCON properties and management. Most of the twenty-three-member G.B.C. body was still gathered in Vṛndāvana, but their immediate business was completed.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s health appeared to be slightly improved, a blessing the devotees and Prabhupāda attributed to the constant chanting. Śrīla Prabhupāda even ate (and digested) some fried food. He also spoke of attempting to resume his early morning translating work. The G.B.C. men, each of whom had pressing leadership and administrative duties within their respective zones, began to feel the need to return to their posts. Aside from their chanting shifts in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, usually for three hours twice a day, they had no other service in Vṛndāvana. The weather was also unbearably hot, up to 120 degrees. When some of them expressed their plans to return to their areas of work, Prabhupāda gave his permission. They had been together for a week, and now, one by one, they began to disperse. Within another week most of them had left Vṛndāvana. Śrīla Prabhupāda and his small staff remained, and the constant chanting continued, performed by the devotees of the Krishna-Balaram temple.\nAs June came in Vṛndāvana, the weather remained very hot. The sky, which had been a clear blue, turned hazy as the first moisture arrived. Between noon and four P.M., the ground was too hot for bare feet, and the residents of Vṛndāvana would stay home, confining most of their activity to either the morning or the late afternoon and evening. Even eating was excluded from the midday, since the heat killed the appetite. The Yamunā was shallow and hot, giving little relief. The cows were gaunt from lack of grass and feed, and occasional hot, searing winds raised dust clouds. Flies and mosquitoes died in the air. One of the few pleasant features of summer was the fragrance ofbelflowers that climbed along the walls around Prabhupāda’s garden, somehow thriving in the dry heat.\nIn the first days of June, Śrīla Prabhupāda experienced some hope of recovery. He asked to resume his morning rides, and when being brought down to the car, he said, “Soon I will get down and walk myself.” His old friend from Allahabad, Mr. Ghosh, came and diagnosed his disease as anxiety for the devotees and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Śrīla Prabhupāda agreed. But he didn’t follow the doctor’s orders, since they included having his blood pressure checked regularly, and taking various medicines and special treatments. But by receiving massages from his servants, he felt he was improving At this rate, he said, he would be all right after a month and a half. But he stressed, “I am not leaving Vṛndāvana until I am well.”\nOne morning Śrīla Prabhupāda asked to go and see the Deities, and his men promptly moved him in his rocking chair before Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. Sitting in his chair beneath thetamālatree, Prabhupāda looked up at the transcendental brothers, while many tears glided down his cheeks. “They are dressed very nicely,” he said. While he basked in the presence of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, he enjoyed the soothing shade of thetamālatree. “The contractor wanted this tree cut down,” he said, “but I would not allow. There are not manytamālatrees left. These worldly men do not know.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda started coming down regularly each morning to see the Deities, an event that gradually grew to become a daily temple function involving ISKCON devotees and guests alike. Prabhupāda would sit in his rocking chair under thetamālatree, and a devotee would leadkīrtana,while Prabhupāda and all the other devotees chanted responsively. For Prabhupāda’s disciples, chanting with him in the courtyard of his temple in Ramaṇa-reti, Vṛndāvana, was the essence of the spiritual world.\nAlthough Prabhupāda’s body was apparently sick, he was still as alert as ever, and every morning he would notice who was there and who was not. The devotees grew to love this special opportunity to associate with Prabhupāda as he sat in his rocking chair, gazing at Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Vṛndāvana residents and pilgrims would also gather around Prabhupāda, often offering money, which they would place at Prabhupāda’s feet. While the energetic younggurukulaboys danced before Prabhupāda, and the pilgrims continuously flowed in and out, offering obeisances and rupees at his feet, and while one of his secretaries fanned him with a largecāmarawhisk, Śrīla Prabhupāda sat gravely yet simply, with his attention fixed on Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma.\nSometimes he would go sit in the private garden adjacent to his main room. A devotee had built a plaster fountain there in the shape of a large pink lotus, and while Prabhupāda sat in the little alcove, surrounded by flowering vines, the splashing of the fountain pleased and soothed. An occasional monkey would come over the wall into the garden, looking for something to steal, and Prabhupāda would have it chased away. Otherwise he sat silently, conversing only occasionally with one or two disciples.\nOne day in the garden Śrīla Prabhupāda was recalling the simple but civilized life he had known as a child. He mentioned the various ceremonies his mother had observed during pregnancy to allay the dangers connected with childbirth. Though his voice was soft and weak, he was still inclined to speak. “So much care was taken for the children,” he said. “Now these rascals are killing children. Most uncivilized life. Two-legged animals. Even in these days, in India in the interior villages, their life can be peaceful. They have enough grains, enough milk to live peacefully and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And they are going there to give this sterilization.” (Śrīla Prabhupāda was referring to Indira Gandhi’s policy of compulsory sterilization.)\nOne of the devotees present had just come from West Bengal, where he had been traveling on a boat down the Ganges, preaching and distributingprasādamin the villages. Śrīla Prabhupāda began describing to him how in the villages they make a simple bread ball fromattar(whole wheat flour) and bake it beside an open fire. “The same fire. It is calledkhāndifire, using cow dung chips,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. “They put one pot upon this fire and use it fordāl.Then after some time, you see if it is boiled – very nice. Then this ball should be cooked inghee.It will be first class.”\nWhile the fountain splashed gently and the pigeons and green parrots fluttered and chattered, Prabhupāda continued to talk freely. He recalled his horoscope at birth: “After seventy years this man will go outside India and establish so many temples.” He said he hadn’t understood at first that he would actually have to go, but when he had finally gone to the U.S., he had had no intention of ever returning. Except for the stroke he suffered in the United States in 1967, he said, he would not have come back. “That means Kṛṣṇa desired,” he said. “Otherwise, I had no plan to come back. Therefore I took this permanent residency.”\n“Do you regret having come back to India?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami.\n“No,” said Prabhupāda. “My plan was like that, to stay. But Kṛṣṇa’s plan was different. When I was coming back [in 1970] I was speaking to Dvārakādhīśa [the Kṛṣṇa Deity in ISKCON’s Los Angeles temple], ‘I came here to preach. I don’t know why You are dragging me back.’ That was when I was leaving Los Angeles. I was not happy. But He had His plan.”\n“Pretty nice plan,” commented Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued, “Kṛṣṇa said, ‘Come, I’ll give you a better place in Vṛndāvana. You were retired in Vṛndāvana, and I asked you to leave. Now you have to come back. But I will give you a better place.’ So He has given me a temple a hundred times better than any other place. Is it not so?”\nSo was Śrīla Prabhupāda “seriously ill” or “better”? “I may live or die,” he said, “in either case I am with Kṛṣṇa.” But he confided, “I asked Kṛṣṇa to give me enthusiasm to continue up to death. A soldier should die fighting on the battlefield.”\nThese letters were almost as valuable as Śrīla Prabhupāda’s, since they were often filled with direct quotes from Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nOne evening Śrīla Prabhupāda called for all the availablesannyāsīs.He said he was feeling tired, but like a father happy to have his children with him, he said, “You should all come to be with me like this, and I feel better.”\nOne day while sitting with Śrīla Prabhupāda, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa began to describe the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa as depicted in the painting hanging to the right of Śrīla Prabhupāda’sprasādamtable. The painting showed Kṛṣṇa and His cowherd friends eating lunch. Śrīla Prabhupāda looked at the painting and then, closing his eyes and thinking of thelīlā,said, “This is the highest perfection of life. I have concluded that whatever is done without Kṛṣṇa is simply a waste of time. What will they think of this?”\nPrabhupāda’s moods moved and varied within the realm of transcendental emotions and attitudes. To some of the disciples attending him, he said, “I am thinking, ‘I am a worthless person, taking so much service. There is no way I can repay you. I am poor in every respect, financially and spiritually.’ ”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa protested, “our only desire is to serve you.”\n“I know,” Prabhupāda replied, “and it is the only reason I am living. All over the world things are going on by your sincere service.”\nBut occasionally Prabhupāda would still reprimand an errant disciple. When, in dressing Prabhupāda, Upendra gave him aluṅgīthat was too small, Prabhupāda called him “a fool and a rascal.” And when Tamāla Kṛṣṇa did not attend Prabhupāda one morning, due to having a cold, Prabhupāda was critical. “I was never neglectful about my duty in any field of activity,” he said, “even business. Dr. Bose loved me very much. He was giving me checks to sign for forty thousand rupees. I was never lazy or neglectful in duty. I would do it honestly and try to make it perfect. Only I was neglectful when I was involved with my young wife. Then I neglected my studies. That was due to circumstances. And then later I neglected my wife. My father said I was fortunate not to like my family. Kṛṣṇa saved me through so many circumstances. This material life is checkered.”\nEarly one morning Śrīla Prabhupāda awoke suddenly. “I had a dream,” he said to the devotees attending him. “There was a big assembly of drunkards and chanters. The drunkards were madmen. Some of the drunkards were becoming chanters. They cannot stop fighting. The drunkards were so crazy.”\n“Were you there also?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“Yes, I was standing there also.”\n“Were some of the chanters becoming drunkards?”\n“Chanters cannot fall down,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Their names are listed – back to home, back to Godhead. They are in Kṛṣṇa’s family.”\nThoudam had grown up in Manipur but after graduating from high school had come to America to continue his education at the University of California. He had been attracted by the devotees chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa on the streets of Los Angeles and had visited the temple. When he met Śrīla Prabhupāda, he became convinced that he had met a genuine spiritual leader. At first Thoudam had maintained his stance as a representative of the world of empirical scientific knowledge, and Śrīla Prabhupāda had invited him for morning walks on Venice Beach.\nDay after day, Śrīla Prabhupāda would draw Thoudam into arguments about the origin of life. When Śrīla Prabhupāda was ready to argue, he would glance around and ask, “Where is the scientist?” And on catching sight of Thoudam, he would ask, “So, what do they say?” Thoudam would then argue that life had arisen by chance through chemical evolution, and Śrīla Prabhupāda would smash the argument with a stunning display of logic and common sense.\nThoudam, by regularly associating with Śrīla Prabhupāda and by reading theBhagavad-gītāAs It Is,had become more inclined to Kṛṣṇa consciousness than to material science, and eventually he had become Prabhupāda’s initiated disciple, Svarūpa Dāmodara dāsa. With Śrīla Prabhupāda’s encouragement, Svarūpa Dāmodara had soon received his Ph.D. and pledged to serve Śrīla Prabhupāda through scientific lectures and writings against the theories of modern, atheistic science.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was well aware of the powerful sway science held over people everywhere, and he was out to combat their godless propaganda. He knew thatBhagavad-gītāwas the highest science, and he saw how outrageously prejudiced many modern scientific assumptions were. For all their high technical jargon and faith in the scientific method, the scientists were actually ignorant of the origin and purpose of life.\nSvarūpa Dāmodara and a few other devotees holding graduate degrees had formed the Bhaktivedanta Institute and were working within academic circles to establish the scientific basis of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrīla Prabhupāda had been especially pleased when at a large meeting of scientists Svarūpa Dāmodara had challenged a Nobel Prize–winning scientist who held that life was a phenomenon that occurred at a certain level of chemical complexity. “If I give you the required chemicals,” Svarūpa Dāmodara had asked him, “will you be able to produce life?” And the embarrassed scientist had replied, “I don’t know.” Repeatedly Śrīla Prabhupāda had referred to that incident in his conversations and lectures.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda often praised the work of Svarūpa Dāmodara and the Bhaktivedanta Institute and assured them that the BBT would provide funds for their printing, research, and building projects. He had given them the arguments, and they were developing them with scientific language.\nNow Svarūpa Dāmodara had come for more association with Śrīla Prabhupāda, and after offering obeisances, he presented Śrīla Prabhupāda with several pink lotus flowers. Śrīla Prabhupāda took one in his hand and opened the petals; the others he gave to his secretary for presenting to the Deities. Svarūpa Dāmodara had also brought several ripe pineapples, and Prabhupāda immediately asked for a glass of fresh pineapple juice.\nSvarūpa Dāmodara was arranging for a conference of scientists in Vṛndāvana to discuss “The Origin of Life.” He had been meeting with various scientists and professors, many of whom had shown interest in Svarūpa Dāmodara’s approach and in participating in the conference. Svarūpa Dāmodara read Prabhupāda the prospectus he had prepared announcing the upcoming conference. Prabhupāda listened silently and at the end said, “All glories to Svarūpa Dāmodara!” Later in the afternoon they spoke again. It seemed that Prabhupāda was never too tired or too indisposed to speak with Svarūpa Dāmodara about defeating materialistic science.\nSvarūpa Dāmodara was getting hope from his conversations with scientists. He told Prabhupāda, “I think they’re interested in the program we are making. Otherwise they wouldn’t take time to discuss. Some of them feel our approach is unique.”\n“There is no other such proposal,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “They have taken God as something mystical. Especially this rascal Darwin’s theory. They have become like animals, and they are seeing everyone as animals. This rascal has convinced them, ‘Your grandfather was a monkey.’ How could they become the son of a monkey? But this is going on. A grand rascal, this Darwin. And his theory is taken as the greatest principle of anthropology in the whole world. So scientists by combined meeting should speak out against this Darwin’s theory.”\nOn the day of Svarūpa Dāmodara’s arrival in Vṛndāvana, the first rains also arrived, indicating the end of summer and the start of the monsoons. Heavy rains beat down while Prabhupāda and Svarūpa Dāmodara continued talking. Prabhupāda said that the Vedic evolutionary theory had been presented in thePadma Purāṇathousands of years before Darwin.\n“If we can get some big scientists on our side,” said Svarūpa Dāmodara, “at least a few, that will be enough.”\n“That I am asking,” said Prabhupāda.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa figured that Śrīla Prabhupāda would be tired after two hours of talking, so he interrupted, “Would you like akīrtanaparty now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?”\nBut Prabhupāda corrected him. “This iskīrtananow going on. People have to understand what iskīrtana.Any topics on Kṛṣṇa, that iskīrtana.Śukadeva Gosvāmī became perfect bykīrtana,but what kind ofkīrtanadid he do?”\n“He was speaking theBhāgavatam,” answered Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “You are simply thinking drums andkaratālasiskīrtana.But anything we do here iskīrtana.There is no material connection here. We are not talking how to increase our business and enjoy women and wine. That is not our aim.Ka uttamaśloka-guṇanuvādāt.We are trying to establish Kṛṣṇa – that iskīrtana. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.Do you know this?”\nTaking this remark as his cue, Svarūpa Dāmodara went on to speak about scientists he had met who were interested in the proposed “Origin of Life” conference. “I am thinking of the title of our conference,” he said, “as a Bhaktivedanta Vijñāna Conference in Vṛndāvana.”\n“No,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “They will take it otherwise, thinking that Bhaktivedanta is not ajñānī.They will take it lightly because Bhaktivedanta Swami is not a scientist.” One of the devotees said that “Bhaktivedanta” actually indicated the highest science, and Śrīla Prabhupāda agreed. But to understandbhakti,he said, was very difficult for the ordinary man.\n“Why not ‘Life Comes From Life’?” asked Prabhupāda. And Svarūpa Dāmodara immediately agreed.\n“Make something extraordinary,” said Prabhupāda. “We are not just some magicians like the otheryogīs.There is money, intelligence, and I can give you inspiration.”\nThe devotees working closely with Śrīla Prabhupāda did not think he was deteriorating; no matter how he appeared, he was just giving them another opportunity to serve him. If he wanted to eat or didn’t want to eat, if he was pleased or displeased, if he appeared well or ill, they would respond accordingly, out of duty and love. This mood was becoming increasingly prominent as Śrīla Prabhupāda more and more depended on his disciples to help him carry out all his functions. He had said he was remaining in the world only to satisfy his disciples’ sincere desires to serve him. Yet he continued to emphasize that their service to his physical form was not as important as their following his instructions.\nWhen two of Prabhupāda’ssannyāsīswere taking leave of him, he smiled pleasingly and said, “I may stay or go, but in my books I will live forever.” When he heard that forty thousand hardbound books had been distributed in one week, he said, “If book distribution increases, I will never die. I will be living for centuries.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa remarked that the book distribution reports were one kind of news that didn’t give Prabhupāda a headache, and Prabhupāda smiled broadly. “No!” he said. “It is my life!”\nBut one day while sitting in the garden with Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, Svarūpa Dāmodara, and others, Śrīla Prabhupāda became very disturbed when he detected a mistake in one of his already printed books. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa was reading aloud a verse from the First Canto which began, “Munayaḥ sādhu pṛṣṭo ’ham.”Śrīla Prabhupāda had him read the synonyms.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa read: “munayaḥ– of the sages;sādhu –this is relevant;pṛṣṭaḥ –questioned … ”\n“Munayaḥ?”asked Śrīla Prabhupāda. Thus he uncovered a thoughtless mistake made by the Sanskrit editors. “This is an address. Here the verse translation properly reads ‘O sages,’ but someone has changed the word by word translation to ‘of the sages.’ ” Śrīla Prabhupāda became very angry and denounced the “rascal Sanskrit scholars.” “A little learning,” he said, “is dangerous. Immediately they think they have become big scholar, thinking, ‘I shall arrange!’ And then they write all nonsense.” He continued speaking about the mistake for half an hour. He was disturbed. He ordered Tamāla Kṛṣṇa to write at once to the BBT and stop these speculations by his disciples –  changing his books in the name of editing. The devotees were startled to see Prabhupāda so angry; he was supposed to be peacefully relishing aŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamreading here in his garden. Such a change was very serious, he said, because it changed the meaning. “Even if the authorizedācāryaswould make a mistake,” he said, “it would not be changed. This isārṣa-prayoga.In this way theācāryasare honored.”\nBy Śrīla Prabhupāda’s strong reaction to this one printed mistake, he was again stressing the great importance of his books. “Whatever I have wanted to say,” he explained, “I have said in my books. If I live, I will say something little more. If you want to know me, read my books.”\nPrabhupāda had said that the only real medicine for him waskīrtana.Andkīrtana,he had explained, included preaching around the world. And for Prabhupāda, who was taking so little food, the chanting of the holy name and thekīrtanaof preaching reports from his disciples seemed to be not only his medicine but his sustenance as well.\nOn the evening of the day Prabhupāda received Ghanaśyāma’s letter, he learned that Gopāla Kṛṣṇa had arrived with copies of several newly published Hindi books. Prabhupāda had been lying in bed, but on receiving the good news, he raised his eyebrows and said, “Bring them immediately!” Gopāla Kṛṣṇa entered with the books, and Prabhupāda immediately sat up in ecstasy.\nBy June 1977, thegurukulabuilding in Vṛndāvana was near completion, and the devotees managing thegurukulawere contemplating opening the building in the near future. They were discussing how the rooms should be used, including which rooms would be for staff offices and residences. Although Śrīla Prabhupāda had not been consulted on these details, he seemed to know what was going on, and one morning he told his secretary he would like to see the new building from top to bottom. After takingdarśanaof Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, he was carried in his chair for a tour of the new building.\nPleased with the construction, he remarked, “By Kṛṣṇa’s grace everything has been done very nicely.” The second floor was one continuous wide veranda with many connecting rooms. “The persons in charge,” explained Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “have one room for residence and one for an office.”\n“Very comfortable,” Prabhupāda remarked. He heard and observed everything, occasionally making suggestions – there should be a flower garden and a fountain in the central courtyard. “I think there is no other building equal to this in Vṛndāvana,” he said. As they came to the first floor, Akṣayānanda Mahārāja, one of the temple managers, pointed out to Prabhupāda, “I want to keep my office here.”\n“That’s nice,” said Prabhupāda. “But because we have got a big enough place now, we should not think, ‘I shall keep one leg in one place and one leg in another place,’ and then the whole thing is mismanaged. Don’t do that. Don’t misuse even one inch.”\n“You were saying you wanted five hundred students,” said one of thegurukulateachers. “So we should keep as much space as possible for the students on the floors.”\n“Yes, yes,” said Prabhupāda. This was the point he wanted stressed.\nBut then another devotee remarked, “We are going to have administrative offices mixing here, both for the temple and thegurukula.”\n“No,” said Prabhupāda, “you have to invite children here. Otherwise what is the use of building such a big building? Not that we have three dozen managers and four students.”\nAlthough Prabhupāda’s soft voice was sometimes lost amid the noise of construction, and although his comments were made intermittently while being carried from place to place, his message was strong and clear. “Now we have a big facility,” he said. “So bring students. That is the first principle.”\n“We have to get the ISKCON students first,” said one of the teachers.\n“ISKCON or FISKCON,” said Prabhupāda, “bring students.” Prabhupāda’s word play made the devotees laugh. But he was serious.\n“It is arākṣasa*civilization,” said Prabhupāda. And he began mimicking the cry of a typical street vendor: “ ‘Do rupyā!Do rupyā –and no knowledge. Kṛṣṇa says,tathā dehāntara-praptiḥ,but all they can understand is two rupees, four rupees. Where they will go in the next life they do not understand. They do not understand eternal life, only how to enjoy this life. They don’t understand one line of theGītā,yet they say, ‘I readGītā.’This darkness is going on, and people are kept in darkness in the name of so-called university education. So ourgurukulawill be successful. It may take time.”\nAfter touring thegurukulafacility, Prabhupāda had the devotees place his chair down once more before returning to his own rooms. With most of the resident devotees of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir, includinggurukulastudents, gathered around him, Prabhupāda made his emphatic point. “You are thinking of management,” he said, “ – this manager and that manager and what rooms to utilize. But my question is, ‘Who will you manage?’ Bringthatperson. In Bengali there is a superstition that you should not lie with your head toward the northern side. So one man said, ‘But I have no head. For me what is the question of keeping it to the northern or the southern side?’ So your contemplation about management is like that. First of all, who will you manage? Simply considering office manager and this and that is not good. First thing is bring students. Then it will be successful.”\nThat afternoon Śrīla Prabhupāda said he would speak to thegurukulastaff. They gathered in his room, and he instructed them as only he could – he who was empowered to lead the world organization of Lord Caitanya’s movement. “Our next business,” he began, “is to approach the well-to-do businessmen and tell them, ‘Children of your family are expected to be educated with good behavior, good character, and devotion. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, “What is the use of begetting children like cats and dogs?” They must be learned and follow thebhakti-mārga.We will teach your sons these things.’ Canvass like that.”\nIn the present society, he said, even the prime minister’s son may be a debauchee. The demon Hiraṇyakaśipu hadn’t wanted his son Prahlāda to be a devotee but to be like himself, a cheater and a diplomat; and today’s society was comprised of little Hiraṇyakaśipus. “But our idea is to create Prahlādas,” Śrīla Prabhupāda continued. “At least 250 students can be accommodated nicely. Throughout India and the whole world you cannot bring 250 students? What kind of managers are you? I say bring five hundred. Canvass like this: ‘I fall down at your lotus feet. I flatter you one hundred times. Kindly hear me!’ In this way canvass. You have to bring students. Not just rooms for management.”\nPrabhupāda said that if thegurukulawas successful and if ISKCON got more standing in the future, the government could take guidance from ISKCON and not allow people to cheat, claiming to be abrāhmaṇaorkṣatriyawithout the training. “These things are now a dream,” Prabhupāda admitted, “but it should be done. I am thinking of so many things. But my life is ending. So keep these ideas. You especially, because you are young men.”\nJuly brought the rainy season to Vṛndāvana. Clouds began building from the beginning of the month, and by mid-July it would be raining daily. The perfumed odor of thekadambaflower was heavy in the air, and after a rain, thenīmblossoms would give off their onionlike aroma. The peacocks, with their full-feathered tails, became ecstatic, dancing, cooing, and calling. Sometimes a sudden rainstorm would come even while Śrīla Prabhupāda was sitting on his bed or at his dictating desk in an unsheltered part of the veranda, and his servants would rush out to move him inside as quickly as possible. Sometimes when rain prevented his using the garden he would recline instead on the little porch overlooking the garden. But at least the 120-degree heat was broken, and the days became more bearable.\nPrabhupāda quietly rested and continued his day’s routine, waiting to see what Kṛṣṇa desired. He would often wake about six A.M. and open his eyes to see Tamāla Kṛṣṇa at his bedside. He would then extend his hands, indicating that he wanted to sit up in bed. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa or another servant would then lightly stroke Śrīla Prabhupāda’s back while Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke his mind.\nVery few devotees were visiting Vṛndāvana, and guests were rarely allowed to see Prabhupāda. His health was not improving, nor did it seem to be at a crisis point as it had been in May. But because he was hardly eating anything, he was not building his strength. His main treatment consisted of hearingkīrtana,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,andCaitanya-caritāmṛta.\nAnd that was extremely difficult. Śrīla Prabhupāda admitted, “When I wrote this, I thought it will not be possible for me unless somebody else helps me.”\n“How did you write it?” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked, and Śrīla Prabhupāda replied, “Kṛṣṇa helped me. I don’t know. [He laughed.] That somebody –  Kṛṣṇa – helped.”\nInevitably the devotees asked, “But how will we explain it to the scientists?”\n“We do not require to satisfy the scientists,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied. “We have to describe according tośāstra.If they can understand it, then they’ll understand it. Otherwise, it is not our business to satisfy the so-called scientists. We are dealing with the real description.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested that the planetarium would spell the downfall of Western civilization.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “I want to expose that they are cheating. Their only interest is to make money, and for this they cheat. If you can make this planetarium, it will be a grand success, triumphant.”\nIn early July, some of the devotees in Vṛndāvana were working on sketches of the universe according to theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.They were puzzled, however, about how to account for satellite photos of the earth, which seemed to contradict theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam’sdescription. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s reply was that the scientists were bound up by their own conditioning and could not go beyond a certain point. When Tamāla Kṛṣṇa reiterated thatŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam’sexplanation still didn’t agree with modern travel around the earth, Prabhupāda insisted that it did.\n“You are prejudiced,” he said. “You’re conditioned with preconceptions of how everything is. It is just like a bull grinding, going around in a circle. He is tied up and simply going around. So everyone is tied up. They cannot go beyond a point, and they cannot move any way they like, just like the bull.\n“They have cheated about going to the moon, so how can we believe them? They want to explain the whole universe, but how can we believe them? Once someone is shown to be a cheater, he will always cheat. A gentleman will say, ‘I don’t know.’ But they are not gentlemen. They are loafer class. How can we believe them? They said the world was flat. Then Galileo said it was round, and for this he was almost hanged. They didn’t know, and he didn’t know. But our knowledge doesn’t change, because it is perfect. As soon as there is change, it is not perfect.”\nA few days later, the committee of devotees returned to Prabhupāda and said that the question was still unanswered regarding how theBhāgavatam’sdescription of Jambūdvīpa could accommodate the fact of traveling west from Los Angeles and reaching India. In reply, Śrīla Prabhupāda stressed that they not concern themselves now with such a minor issue. And he referred to the Pacific Ocean as “a drop of water.” The descriptions in theBhāgavatamcould not be adjusted within the limits of mundane knowledge.\nPrabhupāda gave the example of how after returning from Vaikuṇṭha, Nārada Muni had told a simple cobbler that Lord Nārāyaṇa was passing an elephant through the eye of a needle. “Oh, Nārāyaṇa is so great!” the cobbler had said. But an educatedbrāhmaṇahad said, “It is simply stories.”\nNārada had then asked the cobbler, “How can you believe that Nārāyaṇa was passing an elephant through the eye of a needle?” “Why not,” the cobbler had said. ‘I am sitting under a banyan tree. There are so many fruits, and each fruit contains so many seeds, which will each grow into a big banyan tree.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that with experimental logic one cannot understand the inconceivable. “Everything is inconceivable,” he said, “and these rascals want to bring it as conceivable. Don’t be puffed up by your so-called education. It has no value.”\nSuddenly a large peacock alighted nearby and spread his gorgeous purple, blue, and green feathers, as if posing for the pleasure of the devotees. While abrahmacārīcontinued steadily fanning him, Śrīla Prabhupāda sat silently. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, however, had some business which he thought would not be too demanding for Śrīla Prabhupāda. Sitting at his spiritual master’s feet, he broached an important topic.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he began, “we are receiving a number of letters now from people who want to get initiated. So up until now, since you were becoming ill, we asked them to wait.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested that since theguruhas to take on thekarmaof his disciples, and since Śrīla Prabhupāda’s health was already weak, he should wait before accepting more disciples.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said nothing, and the Vṛndāvana peace was punctuated by the splashing of the fountain. Then he began to speak. He named three of his disciples and said, “So these three can do.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa asked if devotees in America should write directly to these men for initiation.\n“Nearby,” said Prabhupāda, and he named three more disciples, leading devotees in Europe. “Five, six men may divide,” said Prabhupāda. “Whoever is nearest.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa asked whether this would apply to both first and second initiations. Prabhupāda said yes.\n“So there is no need for devotees to write to you for first and second initiation,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “They can write to the man nearest them. But all these persons are still your disciples. Anybody who would give initiation is doing so on your behalf.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa asked if there was anyone in India that Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted to do this, and Śrīla Prabhupāda added another name. Śrīla Prabhupāda asked to hear the names he had given, and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa recited seven names.\n“That’s all, ” said Prabhupāda. “Now you distribute. For the time being, seven names.” Then he added two more. “So without waiting for me,” said Prabhupāda, “whoever you consider deserves. That will depend on discretion.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said nothing else, and after a few minutes Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked if Prabhupāda would like to hear akīrtana.Śrīla Prabhupāda assented by a slight gesture, and the chanters, who had been waiting, came to join him.\nThe next morning Śrīla Prabhupāda added two more names, making a total of eleven disciples who would act asṛtvik,or representatives of theācārya.Śrīla Prabhupāda had not liked the idea of newcomers to ISKCON having to wait unnecessarily long to be initiated. Now initiations could continue regularly at the discretion of his eleven selected men.\nJuly 10Tamāla Kṛṣṇa received a phone call from Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. The Māyāpur temple had been attacked by a gang of three hundred dacoits (hoodlums). Five devotees were wounded and in the hospital. Bhavānanda Goswami had fired a shotgun at the attackers, injuring two. The police, who didn’t arrive until two hours after being called, had arrested Bhavānanda and put him in jail. Śrīla Prabhupāda became disturbed. “If the dacoits attacked and we used our shotgun,” he said, “what is wrong?”\nLater that day Prabhupāda heardThe Hindustan Times’version of the attack. According to the news report, some cows had wandered onto the ISKCON property, and the devotees had beaten the cows. This had angered the villagers, who on coming to the temple to complain had been shot at. Two had been injured. The article named Bhavānanda Goswami and at the end mentioned that the founder of the temple, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, had not been present.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda heard the article, made a few comments, and went on with his afternoon’s writing and translating as usual. But late that afternoon he called for Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “I am afraid of a big conspiracy,” he said. “The last line of the article says that the founder-ācāryawas not present. They were sorry. They would have arrested me and put me in jail.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa scoffed that the news article was one-sided. “That doesn’t sound right,” he said, “that the devotees beat the cows. Devotees don’t beat cows.”\nWithin a few days, a letter came from Gopāla Kṛṣṇa giving the facts of the Māyāpur incident. About fifty Muslim men were stealing crops from the ISKCON land. When Nitāi-cānda tried to stop them, they attacked him, cutting his head in three places. Later, while he was being treated in the temple infirmary, the men came and beat Nitāi-cānda and stripped one of the ladies naked. Meanwhile, another 250 men attacked, breaking the gates, cutting phone and electric wires, and destroying the water pumps. Wanting to scare the mob, Bhavānanda had fired a shot in the air, but when they did not disperse he fired another shot, injuring two men.\nIn the meantime, the attackers had broken both hands of one of thegurukulateachers and beaten many other devotees. Two hours later the police arrived and recommended the devotees go to Krishnanagar police station – twenty miles away – to file a complaint. When the devotees had reached the station, they had been arrested, and the two seriously injured devotees were denied medical treatment. Bhavānanda Goswami was still in jail. Prabhupāda said it was a plot to drive away the Hare Kṛṣṇa men. “They want that all Bengal be completely godless,” he said.\nWhen Tamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested that this incident would hurt their village preaching, Prabhupāda replied, “No, it will be to our favor very soon. I think the central government will take action. This is the same as Kaṁsa against Kṛṣṇa – Kṛṣṇa must win. No one can defeat Kṛṣṇa. If I had been there, they would have charged that I ordered the shooting and arrested me. Now I am an old man, I cannot take an active stand. So you all must do everything carefully.”\nPrabhupāda continued to think and comment on the incident. “Theguṇḍā*class doesn’t like Caitanya Mahāprabhu,” he said. “They say Caitanya Mahāprabhu made people emasculated. In Orissa they say that after Mahārāja Prataparudra met Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he lost hiskṣatriyastrength. He was a very powerful king, but after he met Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he became effeminate.”\n“What is our reply to that?” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“What can you reply?” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “If they conclude something like that, they have no idea of spiritual life. They say this is disruptive, Lord Caitanya’s saying,na dhanaṁ na janaṁ.Wedon’twant such things, and they want them. So how can you reply to such people? Everyone wants this, and we say that we don’t want it. How can you make a compromise with such people? In your country also they say, ‘What is wrong with illicit sex? What is wrong with intoxication?’ They say we are brainwashing. Is it not? It is very difficult to push on this movement. Still we are doing. That is Kṛṣṇa’s grace.”\nSeeing that Śrīla Prabhupāda was disturbed, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested, “Will you try to translate this afternoon, Śrīla Prabhupāda?”\nBut Prabhupāda continued on the same point. “A young, beautiful woman comes at the dead of night to see Haridāsa Ṭhākura, to offer her body, and he denied. Who will appreciate this?”\n“We appreciate,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“You appreciate,” said Prabhupāda, “but in the modern world, who will appreciate?” Prabhupāda continued pointing out the irrevocable split between the devotees and the nondevotees: “Their idea is that a young man cannot live without a young woman, and yet Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, ‘Oh, you are after a young woman? That is more dangerous than drinking poison!’ ”\nAs Prabhupāda spoke of the Māyāpur devotees who had been willing to sacrifice their lives for Kṛṣṇa, he became choked with emotion and began to cry. “Kṛṣṇa will give them protection,” he said, “our Māyāpur men.” He mentioned how Haridāsa Ṭhākura had also been put into jail and beaten and how Prahlāda Mahārāja had been tortured, until Lord Nṛsiṁha had appeared. “Don’t be worried,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, crying, and speaking as if all his Māyāpur devotees were directly in front of him. “Kṛṣṇa will protect you. We are doing our best as far as our intelligence goes. Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted that in every nook and corner of the world this movement should be pushed. We are limited.”\nIn an attempt to ease Prabhupāda’s sorrow, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa started reading the latest report from Ghanaśyāma, who was distributing books in Eastern Europe. The report of extraordinary success drew Prabhupāda’s attention away from Māyāpur. He smiled and said, “That is dynamic.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa continued reading the report.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa looked up from the letter and commented, “He has been everywhere, Prabhupāda, and he says that your books are more appreciated in the Communist countries than anywhere else in the world.”\n“Yes,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “they are hungry.”\nA few days later a full, on-the-scene report came in the mail from Jayapatāka Swami in Māyāpur. The local Hindus of Māyāpur were outraged at what had happened and were mobilizing mass petitions in support of the ISKCON temple. Although the newspaper reports were false, gradually people were learning the facts. Jayapatāka reported vivid details of Bhavānanda and other devotees being marched through Navadvīpa in chains on their way to court and the people of Navadvīpa offering them respects. The devotees were still in jail, he said, constantly chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.\nOn the whole, the report was optimistic.Prasādamdistribution was continuing in Māyāpur, book distribution in West Bengal was increasing, and the preaching parties were well received wherever they went. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s prediction was coming true: the incident was turning in the devotees’ favor. He commented that the enemies had thought they were digging up a garden snake by attacking Kṛṣṇa’s devotees, but they were finding that they had in fact unearthed a cobra.\nSpeaking into the hand microphone of his dictating machine, oblivious to his bodily condition, Prabhupāda described patiently and methodically how Nanda Mahārāja’s family priest, Gargamuni, performed the name-giving ceremony for baby Kṛṣṇa. In his purports, Śrīla Prabhupāda often spoke from his personal experiences and realizations.\nSometimes sitting in the predawn open air on the second-floor veranda and sometimes in the humid heat of bright afternoon, Śrīla Prabhupāda worked, describing the limitless Vedic knowledge, just as his predecessors, the Gosvāmīs and Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, had done when worshiping Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya while living in Vṛndāvana. Śrīla Prabhupāda, however, was the first greatācāryato make Kṛṣṇa conscious literature available to persons of all countries throughout the world, regardless of birth status or previous character. Even as he composed the latest chapters ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,thousands of young men and women were working on his behalf to preach the Vedic message to the world. His disciples were, in fact, keenly aware of how Śrīla Prabhupāda was producing the Tenth Canto purports in Vṛndāvana, and they prayed to Lord Kṛṣṇa that he be allowed to continue for many years, so that he could complete the entireŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nIn explaining the infant pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Śrīla Prabhupāda described an entirely transcendental mode of consciousness, beyond material designations of babyhood or old age.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was now rendering a particularly sweet part of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes, and with relish he described Kṛṣṇa’s stealing butter and feeding it to the monkeys and His showing the universal form to mother Yaśodā. In describing how the vision of Kṛṣṇa’s universal form was beyond mother Yaśodā’s comprehension, Śrīla Prabhupāda shed light on all incomprehensible situations – including his own.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda made deep and joyful appreciations of the pure devotion of mother Yaśodā for baby Kṛṣṇa, and he described her as the emblem of all pure devotees of the Lord, especially the residents of Vṛndāvana, who love the Lord in spontaneous affection. “The pure devotees who inhabit Vṛndāvana,” he wrote, “do not possess any bodily conception.” Such pure devotees were fully dedicated to the service of the Lord in sublime affection,prema.This had been described by Lord Caitanya, he said, as the highest perfection of life, pure love in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. “And mother Yaśodā,” Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote, “appears to be the topmost of all the devotees to have attained this perfection.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was concerned that what he wrote be published and distributed; it was his service to his Guru Mahārāja. And he received great satisfaction in hearing that book distribution was still expanding all over the world. Harikeśa Swami, the G.B.C. of Northern and Eastern Europe, reported that he was printing a very large quantity of books in thirteen languages. After hearing only the beginning of this report, Śrīla Prabhupāda exclaimed, “All the blessings of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Mahārāja on you! You are the most important grandson of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. Go on doing like this.”\nIn a similar mood, Śrīla Prabhupāda pushed his G.B.C. secretary for India, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, to produce Hindi books faster and in greater quantities. Whenever Gopāla Kṛṣṇa came to visit Śrīla Prabhupāda without a new publication, Prabhupāda would reprimand him for his slowness. Gopāla Kṛṣṇa therefore began a policy of visiting Prabhupāda only when he had a new book to present. In mid-July, when Gopāla Kṛṣṇa brought a copy ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,First Canto, Part Two, in Hindi, Śrīla Prabhupāda accepted it happily and said, “Twice now unless he brings some book he won’t come, because every time I criticize him: ‘Where is the book? Where is the book?’ ”\nJuly 20Abhirāma arrived and reported to Śrīla Prabhupāda about Māyāpur. There was nothing new in his report. Later, Śrīla Prabhupāda inquired from Tamāla Kṛṣṇa why Abhirāma had come. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa explained that Abhirāma had decided to take up business but was undecided which city to work in – perhaps Bangalore or Bombay.\nLater, after Śrīla Prabhupāda had retired for the night and was laying in bed under his mosquito net, he again called for Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda was concerned that Abhirāma not drift away from the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement on the plea of looking for business. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that he himself had lived independently ingṛhasthalife and so had Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. “But our aim was different,” he said. “When these neophytes remain aloof from the temple connection, without attending the functions, gradually they will be lost.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa replied that for that very reason he had suggested to Abhirāma that he make his business in Bombay. “Actually,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “I find thegṛhasthashave no desire to live independent of the temples.” He explained that in the Bombay temple thegṛhasthascould get apartments near enough to the temple so that they could attend themaṅgala-āratiand other functions.\n“Yes,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Unless these things are continued, thekarmīs’poison will spoil them. He can do independent business. There is no harm. But he must be connected with devotional service.” Śrīla Prabhupāda had not moved his body while talking, but he had turned his head slightly. Now he laid his head on the pillow.\n“Just like Abhirāma constructed that house,” Prabhupāda continued. “That’s all right. It is within the campus. There is no harm. But if now he goes away after so much training and advancement, if they are lost, then that’s a great loss for the society. With great difficulty we make one Vaiṣṇava. And again if he goes, like Śyāmasundara, then it is a great loss. The whole idea is to give up attachment for the material world and increase attachment for Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection. Now according to one’s position, it can be done gradually. But this is the aim.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda told Abhirāma that by doing a business in Bombay, he could benefit by living near the temple. “Gṛhasthasshould not be dependent on the society,” he said. “At the same time they should not be independent of the society.” Śrīla Prabhupāda laughed at the apparent contradiction. “This is the position,” he said. “Our society cannot take charge of a family. There will be so many numbers of families. How we will support? At the same time, if they remain independent of the society, without touch, then thekarmīs’poison will infect them.” Śrīla Prabhupāda concluded that the solution for thegṛhasthawas either to get an apartment near the temple or to live in the temple, if possible. “They should not live completely independent,” he said. “That will be future danger.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said he wanted ideal Kṛṣṇa consciousgṛhasthas.“Just like Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura,” he said. “There are many. I wasgṛhasthaalso. There was Deity worship, everything nice. I was publishingBack to Godheadasgṛhastha.So the aim of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was there. I could not leave family life because of certain circumstances. That is a different thing. But I must be in touch with devotional service as in the temple. If you live nearby the temple, it is easier. Or in the temple. But if he remains aloof, that is dangerous.”\nWhen Tamāla Kṛṣṇa brought up some problematic details ofgṛhasthasliving in the temple buildings, Śrīla Prabhupāda stayed to his main point and said, “Anyway, these things have to be adjusted. You cannot follow very rigidly in the case ofgṛhasthas.Somehow you have to adjust. We cannot allow them to be lost.” Prabhupāda saw with alarm that after much training, agṛhasthacouple could be lost simply because they disassociated themselves from the temple. It would be a great loss, and in an attempt to avoid it, he was instructing one of his G.B.C. representatives. Prabhupāda said unless this danger was curbed, “then the future of our society becomes hopeless.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s servant Upendra was also present, and he asked Prabhupāda about a man’s responsibility to maintain his wife and family. A man should not marry, said Prabhupāda, unless he had the power of maintaining his family. He should not expect the temple to. “Why should we maintain agṛhastha?”said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “And where is the means? But these things are all to be adjusted. I can give you the idea.” Then Prabhupāda gave the example that if agṛhasthawas maintaining the Deity worship gorgeously in the temple, that was also preaching, and the temple could consider maintaining such a man’s family.\n“So the guiding principle,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “should be that under no circumstances should anyone become lost.”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “Or else, where is the preaching? It will be like Alexander the Great. He was conquering, but as soon as he went to conquer a new place, the last place was lost. Suppose I have conquered Bombay. Then I go to Karachi, but in the meantime Bombay is lost. That was being done by Alexander the Great. When there is no proper management … . Just like the British Empire was lost in that way. They could not manage.”\n“So similarly we should not expand too quickly,” suggested Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “unless we have the proper management.”\n“I am therefore stressing book selling,” said Prabhupāda. He wanted to impress upon his leaders the main outlines of his program, and it should be their duty to carry these programs out. “At least don’t make me Alexander the Great in my lifetime,” he laughed. “They say to me, ‘You are great, great, great.’ But don’t make it small while I am living.”\n“Or after,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “We’ll never make you that way. We should never do that.”\n“Then,” said Prabhupāda, “that’s my request. People recognize I am great. Don’t make me small. I’ll not give you much trouble, but I am now invalid. What can I do?”\n“It seems like even if you are invalid,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “it gives us more opportunity to serve you.”\n“Thank you,” said Prabhupāda. “What can I do?” He laughed softly and said, “I have to give you that opportunity.”\n“It seems that it is your mercy to us,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“All right. Go on,” said Prabhupāda, dismissing them.\n“Jaya,Prabhupāda. Thank you for all your merciful instructions.”\nJuly 22In the morning, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa told Prabhupāda that on the following day Lord Jagannātha would travel down Fifth Avenue in New York City. “Lord Jagannātha is very kind to themlecchas,”Prabhupāda said. “Oriyans are mostlymlecchas,but still they are madepūjārīs.One devotee criticized an Oriyan, and Lord Caitanya slapped him: ‘Why do you criticize My servants?’ Just see His kindness! I prayed to Kṛṣṇa, ‘Anyone who has given a little service, please bless him.’ And Kṛṣṇa actually does. He doesn’t forget any service done.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa inquired, “Doesn’t Rādhārāṇī also pray like that to Kṛṣṇa?”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “Rādhārāṇī says, ‘I am not sincere. Here is Your real servant.’ That ismahā-bhāva.Kṛṣṇa becomes a servant to His servant. Therefore a disciple’s first duty is to be submissive to hisguru.”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “all your devotees are very much grateful to you.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda suddenly became immersed in thoughts of his devotees, and he became very ecstatic. Closing his eyes and rocking his head, he spoke with a choked voice and tears. “Oh, your intense love for me. I am living for you. All over the world everything is going on – money is coming and being spent – and I don’t have to worry. I am so much indebted. And I am taking so much service from you all.”\n“It is we who are indebted,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “There is no way we can ever pay this debt to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\n“That is abṛhad-mṛdaṅga,” said Prabhupāda. “I am beating from this room, and the sound goes ten thousand miles away. Our enemies are surprised: ‘How this man is still going on?’ ”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda went on appreciating how people in so many cities were enjoying the Ratha-yātrā festivals, seeing Lord Jagannātha, and dancing and chanting. He remembered past Ratha-yātrās, such as in 1969 in San Francisco, when some of the devotees were dancing joyously around a tree. He began recalling many other past wonderful experiences in ISKCON.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa had been acting as Śrīla Prabhupāda’s personal secretary for six continuous months, and he had become Prabhupāda’s eyes and ears and his spokesman, especially in dealing with ISKCON management. And he had also become a personal confidant, assisting Śrīla Prabhupāda in his transcendental moods. As a sincere servant, he now began suggesting a different remedy. Śrīla Prabhupāda had recently been feeling and expressing intense devotion toward his disciples in their preaching. Taking this as a cue, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested that if Prabhupāda could travel to the West and be with his disciples there, he would find new life.\n“But if I die,” said Prabhupāda, “I want to do so in Vṛndāvana.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa replied that Śrīla Prabhupāda should not think of dying. If he would go on a tour of the West, see the devotees there, takeprasādammade from food grown on the ISKCON farms, then certainly he would respond to such devotion and regain his appetite and strength. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa pointed out that when Śrīla Prabhupāda had been feeling like this in May and the G.B.C. had come, he had responded to their reciprocation of love by increasing his own desire to live.\n“One thing you can do,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “In your daily routine, you can pray to Kṛṣṇa, ‘If You want him to stay, please cure him, and if not, please take him away. We are fully surrendered to You. Now it depends on Your desire to keep him alive or let him leave this world.’ ”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was pointing out that he was not a victim of some mundane moroseness robbing him of a will to live. He had already said that he would be with Kṛṣṇa in any case. Staying in this world or leaving it was not up to him, but up to Kṛṣṇa. He recited the prayer of King Kulaśekhara from theMukunda-mālā-stotra:“Mydear Kṛṣṇa, please let me die immediately so that the swan of my mind can be encircled by the stem of Your lotus feet. Now while I am still strong. Otherwise, at the time of my final breath, when my throat is choked up, how will it be possible to think of You?”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa persisted in his affectionate line, however, insisting that Śrīla Prabhupāda could not think of leaving. There was so much unfinished business for Prabhupāda in this world, such as personally seeing to the installation of the Deities of Rādhā-Rāsavihārī in the Bombay temple.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda admitted it was so and added, “Another ambition I have is that the populace is suffering from agnosticism. The rascals are suffering, but they do not know why. I want to drive away agnosticism from the world.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa assured Śrīla Prabhupāda that if he were to go to the West, agnosticism would be driven out. The devotees were already working hard on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s instruction. But if they could have his physical presence, they would increase their preaching unlimitedly. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa no longer kept himself only in a passive role, waiting for the spiritual master to ring the bell and then waiting to hear what he wanted. Now he was trying to persuade Śrīla Prabhupāda to travel, and as Prabhupāda began to consider it, he became enthusiastic.\n“When I am in Vṛndāvana,” said Prabhupāda, “it is transcendental. That much mercy Kṛṣṇa has shown me. And wherever there is our center, that is also Vaikuṇṭha – New York, Los Angeles, Paris, or London.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa offered an itinerary: a visit to London, staying at the Bhaktivedanta Manor, and also seeing Rādhā-London-īśvara; then to New York and seeing the devotees in the ISKCON skyscraper with Rādhā-Govinda; then to the farm in Pennsylvania; and then Los Angeles, where he could see the new dioramas of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes.\n“To remain in Vṛndāvana is a sentiment,” Śrīla Prabhupāda agreed. “In New York if I die you will have to entomb me on the roof,” he joked grimly. “There is no other room. If I die, as long as I die among you, you are all Vaikuṇṭha men. I had a dream that Vaikuṇṭha men came to take me. They were all white men with shaven heads. Your countrymen cannot believe how you have changed.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda said that they should consult an astrologer to see whether it was auspicious for him to travel and whether he would be cured and how long he would live. “I was born in the evening at four P.M.,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “It was Nandotsava. You can consult an old Pañjikā to see the day. It was a Tuesday. I am prepared to go to the West.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa then quoted from theBhagavad-gītā,Chapter Two, verse 37, where Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna to fight: “Either you will die and achieve the heavenly planets or conquer and enjoy the earthly kingdom.” Śrīla Prabhupāda said the verse was appropriate. Throughout the night and the next day he considered the traveling proposal and mentioned to his other servants, “Tamāla is arranging a big party.”\n“I was praying to Kṛṣṇa, ‘What is this slow death?’ ” Prabhupāda told Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “Then you quoted that verse. At least my disciples will know I came at the risk of my life. They are the future hope. I must enthuse them. Kṛṣṇa ordered Arjuna, and I am Arjuna’s servant. I am not so limited to think that this is my country. Everything is Kṛṣṇa’s. Why should I limit Kṛṣṇa?”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa gave encouragement: “When you get there, with so many devotees who are giving their lives for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness and assisting you, it will really be enthusing. And you won’t have to speak so much. It’s your presence – your seeing the devotees and them seeing you. So in that sense, it won’t be exhausting. It’s a good climate now, too – August – in London. It’s a very good time.”\nPrabhupāda turned to Upendra and said, “His words are making me feel different. Just hearing, I become enthusiastic.”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “by going West I know you will recover.”\n“May Kṛṣṇa fulfill your words,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. He spent the rest of that afternoon hearingCaitanya-caritāmṛtareadings from various devotees. At one point he began to express great bliss and said, “ReadCaitanya-caritāmṛtaalways to me! These threebooks.*There is no comparison in the world. I may boast like this. I am fortunate to be able to present these books throughout the world, and people are accepting them even blindly.”\nAfter a day had passed, Śrīla Prabhupāda considered the travel proposal more seriously and mentioned some of its defects. He said that wherever he went, his physical condition would go with him.\n“But here you have not been translating lately,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“Who says I shall never again translate?” Prabhupāda countered. “Every action has some relaxation and then activity again.” Prabhupāda said that according to allopathic medicine, the only hope for him was to enter a hospital and undergo intensive medical treatment. According to Ayurvedic medicine, however, there were specific medicines. As Prabhupāda sat on his balcony speaking with his secretary, he wore sunglasses. He would wear them even late in the day or in a darkened room. To his disciples, this was another source of worry – that he appeared to be having problems seeing. Such things made the prospects of traveling to the West seem doubtful. Why couldn’t he just stay in Vṛndāvana, some of the devotees reasoned, where everything was arranged for his convenience?\nThe devotees had sent messages to three astrologers, and all the reports returned that same afternoon. Some of the reports offered absurd remedies without knowledge of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s position, but all of them agreed on one point: the next two months would be the most difficult of Prabhupāda’s life, and traveling should be avoided. One astrologer recommended Śrīla Prabhupāda wear a blue sapphire.\n“So it is not hopeless,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, after hearing all the reports. “At least for the next five weeks, keep me very carefully. For the time being, no travel. Secure this blue sapphire, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\n“After all,” he said, “so long we have got this body, thenjanma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi[birth, death, old age, and disease] we have to accept. This is the statement ofBhagavad-gītā.So the human endeavor should be to stop this repetition of birth and death. When Viśvāmitra Mahārāja went to see King Daśaratha, the king inquired,punar-janma-jayāya:‘Youare a great saintly person trying to conquer over birth and death. Is your process going on nicely?’ ”\nPrabhupāda then used the example of his bodily condition in a different way, to illustrate the concept ofvarṇāśrama-dharma.He compared thebrāhmaṇasto the head, thekṣatriyasto the arms, thevaiśyasto the belly, and theśūdrasto the legs. “If they are all in good condition, then the health is all right,” said Prabhupāda. “Now at the present moment I am suffering because my belly department is not working. So we cannot neglect any department. There must be all departments, and they must be cooperative and healthy. This movement is meant for that purpose. It is the duty of government to give us protection.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda mentioned the devotees’ recent difficulties in Māyāpur and asked for protection. “We’ll do it no doubt,” Governor Patwari replied. “I’m meeting the prime minister tomorrow, and we are going to discuss that matter.” The governor acknowledged that the reports in the newspaper were distorted. He asserted that Madras had a good atmosphere for religious work, and he mentioned severalsvāmīswho were doing good work. Of one he said, “He is making good propaganda aboutGītāeverywhere.”\n“There are many persons making propaganda,” said Prabhupāda frankly. “But if you don’t mind my saying so, all these men are in ignorance of what is the real meaning ofGītā.”Bhagavad-gītā,he said, should be understood as it is, and it should be adopted especially by therājarṣis,or government leaders.\nAgain the governor said how nice it would be if Prabhupāda would come to Madras. Prabhupāda seemed to consider it seriously and thanked the governor. Finally, Prabhupāda requested help in getting the permanent residency in India for some of his disciples. “They will never do any harm,” he said. “They will never take part in politics.”\n“I know it,” said the governor. “I know it.”\n“So kindly try to help,” said Prabhupāda.\nLater, when Prabhupāda mentioned he was fifty-percent decided to go to Madras, he and his servants began discussing the merits of travel to Madras and other places in the world. Although he could not move even a few feet without assistance, if Kṛṣṇa desired he was willing to travel.\nJuly of 1977 was special for pious Hindus, and the people of Vṛndāvana spent extra time in reading scriptures and visiting holy places. So by the end of July, when the trees and bushes were freshening with green leaves, pilgrims came in crowds to Vṛndāvana and to the Krishna-Balaram Mandir. Despite the mud and the rain, many of the people were in a jubilant mood, relieved from the oppressive heat and anticipating Jhulana-yātrā, the swing festival of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Jhulana-yātrā was Vṛndāvana’s biggest festival and would occur in mid-August this year.\nThe local newspapers were giving reports on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s health, and a genuine concern for his well-being prevailed throughout Vṛndāvana and surrounding villages. Therefore, because of the festival season as well as out of concern for Śrīla Prabhupāda, many people were coming to the Krishna-Balaram Mandir. Those who came around nine A.M. got to see Śrīla Prabhupāda when he went for his morningdarśanaof the Deities.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda still had no appetite and had scarcely eaten during the past six weeks. He was no longer regular in his times for sleeping, taking massage, or sitting up and translating. Feeling himself to be at a critical period, he had given permission for the devotees all over ISKCON to recite a simple prayer: “My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, if You desire, please cure Śrīla Prabhupāda.” He would regularly go before the Deities each morning. Wearing his dark sunglasses and sitting erect in the rocking chair, he would hold his palms together in a gesture of prayer, while two men, one in front and one behind, carefully carried the rocker from Prabhupāda’s room into the temple room. They would set the chair down first before the Deities of Gaura-Nitāi, then before Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma, and then before Rādhā-Śyāmasundara. Then they would carry him to a central spot in the courtyard, under thetamālatree, and set his chair down on the black and white checkered marble floor.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda would sit facing Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, and the devotees would sit down around him and begin akīrtana.As thekīrtanabegan, twogurukulaboys would rise and come in front of him, where they would begin dancing with arms upraised, their cottoncādarasswinging back and forth. Prabhupāda would usually not speak or even smile, but after a few minutes would give his garlands to a devotee, who would place them around the necks of the dancers. Soon two other young boys would come forward, and the first boys would garland them with the garlands they had received from Śrīla Prabhupāda and sit down. For half an hour, the dancing and singing continued. Guests to the temple would gather, many of them offering money at Prabhupāda’s feet, which rested on an embroidered silk cushion.\n“His main point, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Abhirāma, “was that for six months there is trouble, especially in the first week of September and then again on certain dates in October and November. The longevity is eighty-two years, five months, and eleven days, which means February 28, 1978. This is according to birth and stars arrangement. But he made it very clear that due to the hand of Kṛṣṇa this could be changed. And if you can pass through 1978, then he sees four or five years ahead clear.”\nWhen the report was finished, Śrīla Prabhupāda was quiet for a few minutes and then said, “By calculation the age is finished. That doesn’t matter. Rather, if I am finished now, it will be glorious.”\n“Living will also be glorious,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“Yes,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Let us see as Kṛṣṇa desires.” Other horoscopes also showed an inauspicious time ahead, due to the entry of Saturn into the eighth house. Śrīla Prabhupāda took this to indicate that his condition was most critical. In either case – whether according to the stars or according to Kṛṣṇa – who could change destiny? Everything was in Kṛṣṇa’s hands. But Śrīla Prabhupāda was still inclined to tour the West. “If I can work a little more,” he said, “our society will be very strong. I want to see that what I have done is made still stronger.”\nPrabhupāda’s talk of travel, however, coincided with increasing weakness. He talked less. When Tamāla Kṛṣṇa tried to encourage him to translate, he replied, “When I get inspiration, I will take it up. Don’t try to force me. I am going through a difficult time and am now feeling restless. It is not mechanical.”\nTo Satsvarūpa, Prabhupāda said, “I like your magazine [Back to Godhead],especially the article ‘Śrīla Prabhupāda Speaks Out.’ ”\nŚrutakīrti, who had come from Hawaii, showed Prabhupāda some candles they were producing and selling, and Prabhupāda laughed. “You Westerners,” he said. “There is no scarcity of money. But now I have taught you how to spend it.” For more than half an hour, Prabhupāda went on talking pleasantly.\nLater, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa told the devotees that Prabhupāda’s outlook seemed to change, depending on the people around him and the news he received; and he told them of Prabhupāda’s plans to go to the West.\nThat evening, when Śrīla Prabhupāda called for “Tamāla and the others,” the devotees gathered and went up to Prabhupāda’s balcony, not knowing what to expect. Śrīla Prabhupāda was lying on his bed. “Sit down,” he said. “I want simply to see you all. It gives me vital force.” Mercifully and lovingly he looked upon his devotees as they sat around him. The air was filled with frankincense billowing from the pot of coals Upendra had prepared for keeping mosquitoes away. Eveningāratibegan in the temple, and the sounds of thekīrtanarose to the little balcony. One by one the men present began to massage Prabhupāda. Śrutakīrti and Satsvarūpa were each massaging a leg, while Tamāla Kṛṣṇa massaged Prabhupāda’s head. Another devotee fanned. Prabhupāda lay back with his eyes closed peacefully. “You are all Vaiṣṇavas,” he said. “Be merciful to me.”\n“You are that one Vaiṣṇava, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Satsvarūpa.\n“You become,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Each of you. Why not?”\n“We can try,” said Gurukṛpā Swami.\n“Yes, try,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “But follow. Do not imitate.”\n“Today we have a letter about book distribution,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “the monthly report.”\n“That is the real good news,” said Prabhupāda, and he listened with full attention as Tamāla Kṛṣṇa read the BBT newsletter. He was pleased and absorbed, sometimes shaking his head and smiling to hear the achievements of his disciples. Then he heard a long letter from Ghanaśyāma about his triumphant book distribution in Eastern Europe. When he heard a letter from Tulasī dāsa, who was developing a Kṛṣṇa conscious farm community in South Africa, he commented, “This letter makes my chest swell, that I have such disciples performing such activities.”\nIn another letter, a devotee wrote a prayer stating that all his Godbrothers were praying for Prabhupāda, and he hoped that Kṛṣṇa would respond. “Surely,” said Prabhupāda, “I am practically living on your prayers. I haven’t eaten in the last six months. So I must be simply living on your prayers.” And hearing in a letter from South America that devotees were praying for him, he said, “I think I will have to stay. Kṛṣṇa is very kind. He isbhakta-vatsala.So many devotees are praying, it cannot be frustrated. I think this is why I am feeling inspiration to go out. In this condition, anyone else would prepare for death, but I am going on a tour. I don’t think of it as sentiment. Kṛṣṇa is actually present as the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. I am not without Vṛndāvana wherever I go to our temples.”\nPañcadraviḍa Swami wrote that he would exchange his youth for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s old age. “We are the same age,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “The body has nothing to do with theātmā.In the Vaikuṇṭha world, we are the same age. New life, new boys –nava-yauvana.The outward dress does not affect one.” As a further reply to Pañcadraviḍa, Prabhupāda dictated, “May Kṛṣṇa give you long life, and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You are our future hope.”\nFor the devotees who had not been with Prabhupāda in months, it was like old times, sitting with him and hearing him answer letters and give advice for becoming victorious in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Hearing him discourse made everything all right. But as they were leaving his room, he said softly, “These are my last days.”\nHaṁsadūta’s letter contained news of a debate he was having with a famous atheist in Colombo, a Dr. Kovoor. As soon as Tamāla Kṛṣṇa began to read the letter, however, Prabhupāda asked to hear Dr. Kovoor’s response. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa then began reading from a news clipping enclosed in the letter.\n“Das and Swami asked whether scientists can make a chicken to come out of a plastic egg,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa read. “I do not know whether they are aware that scientists have made over ten elements, such as fermium, plutonium, einsteinium – ”\nPrabhupāda interrupted, “Rascal. You are simply producing empty sound. Where is the chicken, rascal? The chicken, the hen, is better than the scientist. She has produced another egg within a week. You simply say this and that, this and that, this and that, that’s all. What is your value? We don’t give you any value. You are less important than the chicken.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa resumed reading: “We have created over ten elements that even God – ”\nAgain Prabhupāda interrupted. “Who cares for your creation? Without your creation the egg is there.”\n“No, he says,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa went back to reading the text, “even God could not create them, because He did not know the technology involved in making them.”\n“God kicks on your mouth,” said Prabhupāda. “He doesn’t require to take your creation. Without your creation He can do everything. God kicks on your mouth with shoes. Talkative nonsense. Tell him like that.”\n“I’m sure Haṁsadūta did,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “Next we’ll read his reply. Anyway, the scientist goes on, ‘Are these two men aware of the success of the Sri Lanka scientist Dr. – ’ ”\nPrabhupāda: “Who cares of his scientists?”\n“ ‘The Nobel Prize winner in synthesizing amino acids – ’ ”\n“Nobel Prize winner,” scoffed Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Another rascal has given him a Nobel Prize. He is a rascal, and another rascal has given.Suri-sākṣī mātāla.In a liquor house the witness is a drunkard. If there is an incident within the liquor shop and the proprietor of the liquor shop has brought some witnesses, but all of them are drunkards – what is the value of that? As soon as you are drunkard, immediately you are rejected.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa read on, and Prabhupāda continued to interrupt him at almost every sentence. The devotees had not seen Prabhupāda so fiery in weeks. When Tamāla Kṛṣṇa read Haṁsadūta’s reply, Prabhupāda was pleased to see how many of the same points his disciple had made. “He is putting very strong arguments,” said Prabhupāda. “This is preaching!”\nBut Prabhupāda found simply working up the will for travel, and then not going, and then deciding again to go, was exhausting. On hearing the latest news, that the U.S. Consulate insisted on an interview – which seemed to be a physical impossibility – he couldn’t rest. Lying on his bed for hours, he finally called Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and said, “I want to go. Can you arrange to carry me? Somehow or other take me. Here I don’t expect any good. Psychological enthusiasm is there. Don’t be afraid. I am not afraid. Either to die in the temple here or there – it is all Vaikuṇṭha.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked to first discuss this with a few of the G.B.C. men who were present, but when the devotees came into Prabhupāda’s room that afternoon, Prabhupāda said, “No discussions. I have made up my mind. Arrange immediately for going.”\nBut again there were complications. The doctor asked Śrīla Prabhupāda to wait another week, and Prabhupāda also did not want to leave India without his green card for the U.S. He sent Balavanta to Calcutta to try and get the green card. With so many matters unsettled, Prabhupāda remained undecided whether to go to England now or wait.\n“I plan to stay in America,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. “I will not come back until I complete theBhāgavatam.I want to organize there. The American boys are so nice. If I make everything strong then the movement will endure. Let us go now. The doctor will say four days for the medicine to act, then wait a little longer. This is their method.”\nFinally a report came from Abhirāma in Calcutta that the passport had been secured and the American Consulate in Calcutta would help in getting the green card. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa ran upstairs and told Śrīla Prabhupāda, “There is very good news.” Śrīla Prabhupāda was lying down in bed, but when he heard the news he began to slowly clap his hands, saying, “Give me good news and keep me alive!” He began to think ahead to London. “The Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities there are so nice,” he said. “Rādhā-London-īśvara – an innocent boy, He is.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa reminded Śrīla Prabhupāda how they had obtained those Deities.\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda, “it was unexpected. I was in a hopeless condition, but Kṛṣṇa said, ‘Here I am. Take Me.’ ” Śrīla Prabhupāda thought of the Bhaktivedanta Manor. “That lawn before my room is magnificent,” he said. “I think good time is coming. Madhudviṣa has come, and Gaurasundara has come – lost child has come. These are good signs.” As he spoke on, his voice, which had sounded at first small and weak, grew in strength. “Mistake there may be,” he said, referring to the fall of some of his disciples. “But it can be rectified. At the time be very careful not to commit mistakes. Kṛṣṇa never forgets a person who does a little service.”\n“You also never forget, Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“How can I forget? You have all helped me to execute the mission of Lord Caitanya and my Guru Mahārāja. I always pray to Kṛṣṇa to give you strength. I am insignificant. I cannot do anything. But I pray to Kṛṣṇa to give you strength.” Prabhupāda recalled how after installing the Deities in Australia he had thought, “Thesemlecchasandyavanas,what will they do with the Deity?” Then the next time he went there he saw that they were worshiping nicely. “Try to do everything nicely,” he said, “and Kṛṣṇa will help. Whatever I have done has been done on this principle. Whatever my Guru Mahārāja taught me, I tried to the best of my capacity to carry out.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda spoke on, carried by waves of transcendental emotion and carrying his loving disciples with him. “When I go to America,” he said, “especially Los Angeles and New York, I feel at home.”\nAt the mention of New York, he began to remember his first days there. “I was like a street boy,” he said. “I was going here and there, sightseeing. I was in New York City, but one morning I saw all the walls were white. ‘How have they become white? Who has whitewashed them?’ I thought. I went downstairs, and there was so much snow. I went with an umbrella and purchased a pack of milk in the snow. At that time I was living in a dungeon. It was always dark. But I didn’t care. Whatever difficulty, I didn’t care. I only wanted to preach. Sometimes people would touch me, like men on the Bowery, but no one was inimical. Everyone was friendly. Even the bums. When I went to enter my New York building, the bums would get up from where they were lying down and let me pass by. I couldn’t understand the difference between friends and enemies.”\nPrabhupāda said a friend of his had been shocked to hear that he was moving to the Bowery. “Oh, Swamiji,” his friend had said, “you have gone to Bowery Street? It is a horrible place!”\n“I passed through many dangers,” continued Prabhupāda, “yet I couldn’t understand that, ‘Here is danger.’ Everywhere I thought, ‘This is my home.’ ”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda recalled random details of his first preaching endeavors at 26 Second Avenue. “I was working very hard,” he said. “Lecturing at seven in the morning and seven in the evening. Cooking and distributingprasādamto anyone who was coming. Do you remember, Satsvarūpa? You would bring some mango and fruit. Daily you would come. Those days are passed. Now I feel happiness remembering those days. Remember that boy Stryadhīśa? He would eat so manycapātīs.He would never have enough. Every time he wanted more I would give him fourcapātīsat a time. Kīrtanānanda, Acyutānanda. Seventy-five people would attend that Sunday feast.”\nPrabhupāda recalled the first San Francisco temple, the first Los Angeles temple, going to Seattle, pushing Gaurasundara to go to Hawaii, receiving a letter from Govinda dāsī in Hawaii who said that it was mango season, except that when Prabhupāda went there, “it was rat season, and all night the rats were running in the rafters.”\n“This is a new life, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “There is no doubt about it.” His thoughts returned to his upcoming tour, and he said he could sleep in three seats across in the airplane. But he cautioned the devotees to be careful that once he got to America he not get kidnapped. Previously he had considered that Kṛṣṇa may have been detaining him from going to the West so that he would not be disturbed by the demons. But now he would go in any case.\nPrabhupāda was ready to leave, but the delays and anxieties persisted. Balavanta returned from Calcutta, but Śrīla Prabhupāda was not pleased to see him. Why, he demanded, had he come back without Abhirāma? Balavanta said he had wanted to be with Śrīla Prabhupāda and he thought that Abhirāma could handle the last steps of getting the green card. Prabhupāda reprimanded Balavanta, saying service to theguruwas better than being with him.\nThen Tamāla Kṛṣṇa left for Delhi to arrange for the tickets. When two days later Śrīla Prabhupāda learned that there might be a delay of several days before Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and the other Americans in the party could leave India, he said he could leave immediately, without them, taking Śrutakīrti as his servant.\nThen Prabhupāda heard of an airport strike in London. And the night before his scheduled departure, his health worsened. Many devotees urged him not to go. But amazingly, the tickets and passport arrived, and at midnight on August 28, after a six-month stay in Vṛndāvana, Śrīla Prabhupāda and his party left from the front gate of the Krishna-Balaram Mandir and headed for Delhi in a caravan of cars.\nJust as Prabhupāda was leaving, Bisan Chandra Seth, a friend of Prabhupāda’s in Vṛndāvana, had come and protested, “It will not be good if something happens and you leave your body outside of Vṛndāvana.” Prabhupāda told Mr. Seth that, because his disciples were so much in love with him, he could not easily refuse their request. If the trip became too difficult, he said, he would return immediately. He told Mr. Seth that he was simply depending on Kṛṣṇa.\nPrabhupāda rode lying on a mattress in the back seat of his car, and after two hours of driving over roads greatly damaged by flooding, they reached Delhi airport. Śrīla Prabhupāda waited in the car. The early morning was warm, and the devotees opened the car doors. Bhavānanda Goswami, who had just been released from jail in Bengal, had arrived in time to see Śrīla Prabhupāda. Bhavānanda approached the car and placed his head on Prabhupāda’s feet.\n“How are you?” Prabhupāda asked. Bhavānanda reported that everything was improving in Māyāpur. All the localsādhusand citizens were now siding with ISKCON against the hoodlums who had attacked the temple.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was moved to an airport waiting room prior to going through the customs formalities. About ten devotees were there to see him off as he left with his party of four: Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, Upendra, Pradyumna, and Pradyumna’s wife, Arundhatī. Śrīla Prabhupāda sat upright on the airport couch, silently fingering the beads in his bead bag. His bare feet, resting in his sandals, were slightly swollen, as were his hands. He looked to see who was present and slightly nodded to each disciple in recognition.\nThe devotees felt there was no need for Śrīla Prabhupāda to talk. Just being with him was wonderful and fully satisfying. He had already spoken to them fully and had given himself in his books in many other ways. So they chanted and looked lovingly at him, up until the last moment when he went by wheelchair onto the plane."

        "content": "DURING THE LONG flight, Śrīla Prabhupāda remained solemn. His servants were helpless to alleviate the difficult situation, as they might have in Vṛndāvana, and cigarette smoke, loud talk, and drunken laughter surrounded them. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, despite his concern, did not know what to do for Śrīla Prabhupāda or what to ask him. Śrīla Prabhupāda had often expressed a dislike for conversations with questions like “How are you feeling?”\nPrabhupāda’s servants knew that they could not fully understand their spiritual master’s thinking, and the scriptures also warned that one should not attempt to understand the mind of the Vaiṣṇava. But they knew their service was to relieve him – by arranging for quiet, by assisting him in bathing and dressing, or by taking him to the temple fordarśanaof Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. Now, however, they were helpless to perform any of these tasks. Now, more than ever, Śrīla Prabhupāda was in Kṛṣṇa’s hands. Earlier that year, in Bhubaneswar, he had said that his disciples, although willing to help, could not change the situation if he was inconvenienced by old age. And he had even given the example that although he might be in his opulent quarters at the Bhaktivedanta Manor, that did not mean he would not suffer inconvenience. But Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, being very sensitive to Prabhupāda’s desires and experienced in serving him, several times moved over and spoke with his spiritual master.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said, “when you get to London the devotees will be so pleased to be with you.”\n“Yes,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied, “it is good that we are going.” Otherwise, Śrīla Prabhupāda was mostly silent, meditating on Kṛṣṇa and his mission of bringing love of Kṛṣṇa to the world.\nThe flight turned out to be an unusually exhaustive ordeal. When the plane landed in Rome it was delayed there for four hours, and Śrīla Prabhupāda had to wait in the airport lounge. When finally they arrived over London, the captain announced that they could not land yet due to the strike, and so they continued circling for hours. Finally, twenty hours after leaving Delhi, the plane landed at Heathrow Airport.\nCustoms and immigrations officials and the British Airways ground crew allowed Śrīla Prabhupāda, in a wheelchair, to quickly pass through all the formalities. And soon he was amid a throng of enthusiastic disciples and then sitting in a white Rolls Royce en route to Bhaktivedanta Manor.\nThe London airport and the busy highways leading into the city are certainly a great contrast to the peace and spirituality of Vṛndāvana. But for Śrīla Prabhupāda to suddenly leave the climate and transcendental culture of India to fly to the West was not unusual. He had been doing that, going from East to West, from north to south, from one nation to another – to the snowlands, to the tropics, to the cities, to the jungles, mixing with white people, black people, and Orientals – at an almost constant pace for years. He was no Hindu villagegurusuddenly astounded to see hundreds of automobiles racing on the highway or to see factory smoke or skyscrapers or the blind rat race of the meat-eaters. There was no question of “culture shock” for Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nBut there was a shock for his disciples in London, who had never imagined that he would be so thin or that anyone could travel in such condition. For the devotees who had been at the airport to meet him, it had been a heart-rending experience. Even those who had heard the reports of Prabhupāda in Vṛndāvana were not emotionally prepared for such a change. Prabhupāda was as transcendental as ever, or even more than ever, but the devotees were shocked at first to see him so different. Now he appeared like a powerful sage who had been undergoing long austerities for the benefit of humankind and who had become transcendental to his body, although living within it.\nAt Bhaktivedanta Manor, Śrīla Prabhupāda went from the car to a palanquin and entered the temple room, where about three hundred disciples and well-wishers were waiting to be with him. Devotees from all the ISKCON centers in northern and southern Europe had rushed to England on a last-minute notice. They were holdingkīrtanafor Śrīla Prabhupāda as he entered, and they, too, like the devotees at the airport, were deeply shocked. And for a moment, when they saw Śrīla Prabhupāda wearing his dark sunglasses and appearing so thin, thekīrtanaalmost stopped. Yet they simultaneously remained joyful and ecstatic, realizing that despite such difficulty, he had actually come to the West to be with them and encourage their Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They had been praying for him for months. The prayer, “My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, if You desire, please cure Śrīla Prabhupāda,” had been printed on a banner and hung over Prabhupāda’svyāsāsana.\nThe devotees of England, wanting to reciprocate with Śrīla Prabhupāda with more than just the sentiment of their words, were also leading the world in transcendental book distribution. When, a few weeks ago, they had heard that Śrīla Prabhupāda might be coming to England, it hadn’t seemed possible, considering his physical condition. They had heard he might leave his body at any moment, but then later they had heard he was better and he was coming to London. Even when they had heard he was definitely coming, they had been incredulous. But now it had come true.\nThe Deity room curtains were open, and Śrīla Prabhupāda beheld Rādhā-Gokulānanda. Some devotees stood in front of him, and with a small gesture characteristic of his hand, he waved them aside. Without any change of expression, he sat with concentrated attention facing the gorgeously dressed Deities of Rādhā-Gokulānanda, whom he had named four years ago when calling for Them to come and be worshiped here by the devotees of England.\nWithout saying a word, Prabhupāda went up to his room, where as many devotees as possible joined him. He had always said he felt comfortably at home in these quarters, and once again he was pleased to see outside his window the large lawn, the lake, and the ducks. The devotees sat before him with their palms folded, aware that this was no casual meeting. They had already offered their lives completely to Śrīla Prabhupāda, and there was nothing more they could offer in words that would equal their dedication.\nA devotee placed a large silver plate full ofprasādamon the table before Śrīla Prabhupāda. He picked up a milk sweet and tasted it, then a piece of mango. The hundred devotees who squeezed into the room and looked in from the doorway watched his every movement with fixed attention. There was complete silence. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda looked up, smiling.\n“So,” he said, “is everyone all right?”\n“Jaya,Śrīla Prabhupāda!” was the warm reply. The tension of seeing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s different appearance suddenly melted, and everyone simply wanted to make him feel comfortable and to please him with their service.\nFor the rest of the day Śrīla Prabhupāda remained alone, resting. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa lectured to the devotees in the temple room, explaining how Śrīla Prabhupāda had decided it was better to travel, even at such a great risk, than to be invalid. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa told how someone had suggested Śrīla Prabhupāda go to Tehran or Italy or France, because of the airport strike in London, but how he had said, “I want to go to London.” Śrīla Prabhupāda has come to take shelter of you, said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. He said that, according tośāstra,a devotee should stay in Vṛndāvana, especially at the end of his life, but because Śrīla Prabhupāda’s spiritual master had ordered him to go to the West and preach, he had returned, determined to fulfill that mission until the last.\nThe devotees were deeply touched that Śrīla Prabhupāda’s coming was at least partially in recognition of their preaching. They resolved to reciprocate with him while he was there by holding a book distribution marathon. If they showed him their dedication by preaching, maybe he would stay a long time.\nAt two o’clock the next morning Bhagavān and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa went into Śrīla Prabhupāda’s quarters to attend him. Śrīla Prabhupāda, who had just awakened, was very pleased to see Bhagavān, his leader from southern Europe. This was why he had come to the West: to be with his preachers, and to be encouraged by them.\n“Tamāla has brought me with great difficulty,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “It was the correct thing. I thought, what is the use of dying? Better to come. So Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma has placed me in the care of Rādhā-Gokulānanda.”\nBhagavān presented Śrīla Prabhupāda with some newly printed books: an ItalianBhagavad-gītā As It Is,another volume ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamin French, and other books in Dutch. The total book distribution in Europe, Bhagavān reported, had surpassed that of America.\n“Tamāla, did you hear that?” Prabhupāda asked. “This is my life. Come here.” Śrīla Prabhupāda began rubbing Bhagavān’s head, and tears fell from his eyes. “You have no problems,” he said to Bhagavān. In his own work on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s behalf, Bhagavān had been encountering a rough period, but when Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “You have no problems,” he took it that if he persevered, everything would be all right. As long as he stayed engaged in devotional service he had no problems. For Bhagavān, there was no need for Prabhupāda to say more; Prabhupāda’s order was already his heart and soul. But now that order and Śrīla Prabhupāda’s love entered deeper into his heart. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mood was one of pure thankfulness, without his usual critical instructions. He simply wanted to be with his devotees and encourage them.\n“Produce books,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “These books are all the mercy of my Guru Mahārāja. No author throughout the world has written so many books – Shakespeare, Milton, Dickens. Neither their books have been so widely read or with such appreciation.”\nThe devotees had come to see that Śrīla Prabhupāda actually looked very wonderful in his dark sunglasses and freshly pressed silkdhotīandkurtā,with clean, clear Vaiṣṇavatilakaon his forehead. He would come gliding down the stairs on the palanquin carefully carried by two able-bodied disciples, and he would sit on the vyāsāsanaand watch them performkīrtanaof the holy name. Since he rarely spoke, thekīrtanaand his appreciation of it was the main exchange between him and his disciples.\nExternally, Śrīla Prabhupāda gave very little indication of even appreciating thekīrtana.Those who were standing or dancing near to him, however, could see behind his glasses the tears sprinkling from the corners of his eyes and onto his cheeks. And all the devotees chanted and danced, rejoicing in the knowledge that Śrīla Prabhupāda simply wanted to be with them. They knew that although he was a pure devotee and self-satisfied, he could actually be inspired by his disciples’ affection. By their intense enthusiasm to serve and praise Kṛṣṇa under his order, he could become enlivened to stay in the world longer and preach.\nThe devotees in the Manor agreed that Rādhā-Gokulānanda seemed to be looking especially at Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he was looking especially at Them. Some felt that by witnessing Śrīla Prabhupāda and Rādhā-Gokulānanda, they were looking directly upon the spiritual world, seeing Kṛṣṇa and His pure devotee. Therefore, there was no need for talks or demonstrations further than what Śrīla Prabhupāda was giving everyone by coming to be with them in the temple room.\nEach morning thekīrtanaswould build enthusiastically. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked that devotees not sing theguru-pūjāsong because it created too much emotion for Śrīla Prabhupāda, so they chanted the Pañca-tattvamantraand then Hare Kṛṣṇa. After half an hour, the singing and chanting would be fervid, and Śrīla Prabhupāda would sometimes tap his thumbs together. Just this slightest movement of his body increased the intensity of thekīrtana.Then with the raising of one finger, Śrīla Prabhupāda set the whole roomful of hundreds of devotees into jumping ecstasy. The devotees felt that by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and dancing they were somehow singing and praying for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s good health and continued life. Śrīla Prabhupāda would sit, unmoving. But the devotees knew his desires, and many of them continued jumping several feet into the air, almost touching the chandeliers. After a wild transcendental hour ofkīrtanaŚrīla Prabhupāda would go upstairs again, carried over the heads of the devotees on the palanquin.\nWhen the devotees in London heard that Śrīla Prabhupāda was getting many invitations to go to America, they began to worry. They were thinking this would be the last time they would see him, and they wanted to keep him with them forever. If they could distribute an incredible number of books, then maybe he would live longer and stay longer at Bhaktivedanta Manor. They were already feeling privileged that Śrīla Prabhupāda had chosen their temple out of all others, and as they spoke among themselves, they concluded that Rādhā-London-īśvara and Rādhā-Gokulānanda must be Prabhupāda’s favorite Deities. They realized that aside from chanting and serving, there was nothing they could do to help Śrīla Prabhupāda and keep him with them, and this inability made them helpless. Despite their efforts, everything was up to Kṛṣṇa.\nSince Śrīla Prabhupāda had come to London, his emotions were much more noticeable than before. Where he would have checked his emotions before, he now did not or could not. He frequently cried in ecstasy. Because he was saturated with love for Kṛṣṇa, at any moment his tears might come – while hearing akīrtana,seeing the Deities, hearing of a devotee’s service. The tears would pour down his cheeks, making his visage more beautiful. At other times, he would utter a long, deep “Hmmm,” not out of physical pain, since he said he was quite all right, but out of his Kṛṣṇa conscious emotions, the ecstasy of his love of God.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda looked forward to traveling to America shortly after Janmāṣṭamī, which would fall on September 6, two weeks from the date of his arrival in England. “I want to live a little longer,” he said, “to make everything more perfect.”\n“Will you do this by enthusing the devotees by staying with them,” asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “or is there a specific program?”\n“A specific program,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “I want to introducevarṇāśrama.At our Pennsylvania farm, the biggest problem of life is solved: food.”\nThen Harikeśa Swami, the G.B.C. secretary for northern and East Europe, arrived, he entered Prabhupāda’s room and offered prostrated obeisances. Śrīla Prabhupāda, his eyes overflowing with tears, reached out and rubbed his disciple’s head, and Harikeśa also began to cry.\nHarikeśa explained that he was setting up his own press for producing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books in European languages. “Very good,” said Prabhupāda. “As a father likes to see his estate nicely managed, so I am like that. Get places and print books.”\nHarikeśa Mahārāja had brought with him most of the book distributors from Germany, and he arranged that they meet privately with Śrīla Prabhupāda. The men, most of whom had never been with Prabhupāda, gathered in his room and sat in overwhelming appreciation of the moment. Śrīla Prabhupāda quoted,yāre dekha tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa-upadeśa,’and then asked, “So what is thiskṛṣṇa-upadeśa?” At first no one replied, but then one of the boys spoke and said, “One should preach everywhere.”\n“No,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “what iskṛṣṇa-upadeśa?” Then again there was a silence. This time another boy recited,“Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaranaṁ vraja.”*Śrīla Prabhupāda accepted that and spoke for a few minutes about surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Thinking it an opportune moment, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa brought out a package of color photographs just arrived from Los Angeles. It was a complete story-in-pictures of the recent Los Angeles Ratha-yātrā. The pictures were brightly colorful eight-by-ten-inch enlargements, and as Śrīla Prabhupāda saw one after another and heard the descriptions from his secretary, he began to make long, low humming sounds, and tears came to his eyes.\nEarlier that morning, as soon as he had awakened, Śrīla Prabhupāda had begun spontaneously speaking about the Ratha-yātrā he had performed as a child in Calcutta, and now he was seeing the pictures of a grand procession and festival conducted by his disciples. Seeing the photo of the chariots with a large crowd following, Śrīla Prabhupāda raised his eyebrows and said, “We have never seen such carts!” Another photo showed long lines of people waiting to see the “Changing Bodies” exhibit, a diorama depicting the transmigration of the soul. “I told you this would happen!” Prabhupāda exclaimed. “I am very much glad to see this.” Śrīla Prabhupāda remained so affected by seeing the Ratha-yātrā pictures that he wouldn’t take his usual massage. “Not now,” he said in a choked voice, and he sat meditatively, silent for two hours.\nThe next day was Vyāsa-pūjā, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s eighty-second birthday. Again, upon waking he recalled his childhood and how an uncle had called him Nandulal, because he was born on the day Nanda Mahārāja gave presents to thebrāhmaṇas,the day after Kṛṣṇa’s birthday. Śrīla Prabhupāda went down to the temple, and after a fully exultantkīrtanaby hundreds of devotees, he accepted, without tasting, a three-tier, five-foot-long birthday cake. He noticed that the devotees had only used eighty-one candles, due to counting age by the Western method, so another candle was added. At Śrīla Prabhupāda’s request, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa stood and spoke.\nThe next day Śrīla Prabhupāda’s health suddenly became much worse, and he couldn’t come down to the temple. This was the first crisis since his coming to England, and suddenly his plans changed. Instead of going on to the United States as he had planned, he now requested that he be taken back to India. He spoke of Bombay. “If I live a few days more,” he said, “let me see the opening of the Bombay temple. We can wait here and then fly to Bombay. I have worked so hard for it. If I see the opening and then die, it will be a very peaceful death. Even if I live, I can come back here.”\nThe health crisis seemed to pass, but Śrīla Prabhupāda now felt he would be unable to go to New York. He asked to hear the various astrological calculations. “Let us have a laugh,” he said. The readings predicted that these would be the most difficult days.\nFor many of the devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s not going to America upset their hopes of his getting better and living a long time. But Prabhupāda felt he had traveled as far as he could, and now he should return to Bombay and Vṛndāvana. For a few days more he stayed, waiting for a clearer indication from Kṛṣṇa. And he resumed going to the temple in the morning.\nBrahmānanda Swami had come from Africa, and Śrīla Prabhupāda watched with pleasure as heavy-set Brahmānanda, the first disciple to dance for him eleven years ago in New York, rose to dance again before his spiritual master. As Brahmānanda jumped up and down, dancing ecstatically, Śrīla Prabhupāda smiled and clapped his hands.\nAfterwards, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked Śrīla Prabhupāda what he had prayed that morning as he had sat looking intently at the Deities. Prabhupāda replied, “I was praying to Rādhā-Gokulānanda to please engage me in the service of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Rāsavihārī.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wanted to return to India, and his desire was his servants’ order. “If I survive this time,” he said, “we shall do Vṛndāvanaparikrama.You can carry me on a palanquin.”\nAt the airport there were delays. During the wait, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa put earphones on Śrīla Prabhupāda so he could listen to a tape-recordedkīrtana.Prabhupāda slowly rocked his head, listening, until finally he was allowed to board the aircraft, riding in a wheelchair.\nSeptember 14With no disruptive incidents, Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived with his party in Bombay, where he was promptly escorted from the plane into a waiting car and driven to Hare Krishna Land at Juhu. This time the elevator worked, and Śrīla Prabhupāda reached his quarters on the fifth floor and went at once to bed.\nHe called for Girirāja, who came and sat on the floor beside the bed. Prabhupāda told him how in Vṛndāvana, Mr. Somaiya, a very important man of Bombay known to both of them, had come to see him in bed and had started to cry out of sympathy. Prabhupāda then told Girirāja of his pleasant stay in London, especially mentioning thekīrtanas,which he said were wonderful. When Girirāja asked if the chiseling and hammering and other noises of temple construction in Bombay were going to disturb him, he replied that it was like music. He then lay back and rested.\nWhen Prabhupāda awoke at the end of the day, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked him if the noises were bothering him. “These sounds do not disturb me at all,” he replied, “because I am thinking that work is being completed. You can note the distinction, how in London I was feeling restless, but here not. It is because I like Bombay. Of all the cities in India, I like it the most.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wanted to get reports from some of hissannyāsīdisciples in Bombay. He heard good news from Gargamuni Swami of his party’s selling complete sets ofŚrīmad-BhāgavatamandCaitanya-caritāmṛtaand also other books to libraries and universities throughout India. Now they were preparing to go into Muslim countries to sell books. “Whoever preaches in the Muslim countries,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “I take the dust of his feet on my head.” Lokanātha Swami told Śrīla Prabhupāda of his success in traveling to Indian villages in a bullock cart. Śrīla Prabhupāda loved it.\nWithin a day or two of his return to India, Prabhupāda had abandoned the simple regimen he had agreed upon with a doctor in England. The doctor had said Prabhupāda was a difficult patient. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa mentioned that when he had told the doctor that Śrīla Prabhupāda was trying to cooperate, the doctor had said Śrīla Prabhupāda’s only compromise was to wait until Friday instead of Thursday before traveling. Śrīla Prabhupāda gave a little laugh and said, “And then I went even earlier –  Tuesday. Supercompromise. I could understand when he wanted blood that he would begin his allopathic treatments.”\nFor weeks Śrīla Prabhupāda had been taking a commercially prepared food supplement, Complan, but now he refused it. “What is the use of artificial food,” he said, “when there is natural? You Westerners like the taste of canned, frozen, preserved, rotten food. You eat and then keep the leftovers for seven months, and this you like. And you like drinking cold milk. This Complan is not fresh. I shall try to live on milk and fruit juice. Nothing artificial.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s plan was to stay in Bombay and wait for the grand opening of the temple, now scheduled for Rāma-viyaja Daśamī, in five weeks. But he didn’t expect to get much stronger. Although he had spoken in favor of fresh food, he was actually taking nothing more than a little fruit juice and a littlemung-jala(water in which mung beans have been soaked).\nŚrīla Prabhupāda began chanting constantly on hisjapabeads, which he insisted on keeping around his neck at all times. During his massage he would finger the beads and silently chant, and even while resting they remained around his neck.\nWhen Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked Śrīla Prabhupāda how he felt, he simply replied, “Crisis.” After a few days he named a certain Bombay doctor and suggested that he be brought in. But Tamāla Kṛṣṇa gave arguments as to why calling in yet another doctor would not be good at this time. Śrīla Prabhupāda listened and agreed.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa said he felt confident that Śrīla Prabhupāda would live to see the temple opening in Bombay and later go on to Vṛndāvana. Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed very relieved by these words and rubbed Tamāla Kṛṣṇa’s head affectionately, saying, “May your words be blessed. Bless me that I may fix up my mind.”\nWithin a day or two of his return to India, Prabhupāda had abandoned the simple regimen he had agreed upon with a doctor in England.

Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed very relieved by these words and rubbed Tamāla Kṛṣṇa’s head affectionately, saying, “May your words be blessed. Bless me that I may fix up my mind.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa was pleased to see Prabhupāda take some encouragement, although he felt himself to be in no position to bless his exalted spiritual master. But this kind of exchange had been occurring for weeks now, where Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and others sometimes took the role of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s advisors. Such dealings made the disciples feel uncomfortable, yet because Śrīla Prabhupāda was instigating the relationship, they accepted it as very intimate service. He had openly said, “Encourage me,” and had allowed himself to become dependent in many ways on the care and intelligence of his disciples. Sometimes he was like a small child turning to his disciples to pick him up and carry him. But his disciples remained aware – and if they didn’t, he reminded them – that he was deliberately arranging and allowing this so that they could render him intimate service, for only by serving Kṛṣṇa’s pure devotee can one attain love of Kṛṣṇa. This intimate service was completely spiritual, and for doctors who came and went, with their medicines and prescriptions, it was incomprehensible.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was teaching his disciples right up until his last days – instructing them in how they should prepare for their own inevitable death. And he was also instructing them in the advanced stage of devotional service, testing them to see whether they were willing to serve, not just as official devotees but out of spontaneous love, love which goes sometimes beyond the rules and regulations. This love was tested, for example, by the disciples’ willingness to stay up all hours of the night and constantly attend Śrīla Prabhupāda, assisting him in even his most basic bodily functions. And it was tested as Prabhupāda engaged his disciples in the ordeal of deciding whether he should fight to live or pass away peacefully. It was on the basis of such intimacy, for example, that Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, unsure what was best, argued against Śrīla Prabhupāda’s request for a certain doctor. He was completely involved in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s well-being, and he was always thinking about it and ready to do whatever was required.\nUltimately, Prabhupāda never changed from being the authority and master of all his disciples, and they knew it. They could offer countersuggestions, as he inspired them to reach across the barriers of ordinary protocol and serve him with love to their heart’s content. He even allured them to reprimand him. But when he liked, he would have the final word, emerging again as the absolute authority for his disciples. It was only to serve his will that his disciples lived and acted. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that his disciples’ determination and complete surrender and their desire and prayers for him to remain with them, for him to fight and stay – this was all that was still keeping him in the world.\nCertainly Prabhupāda was not being kept in the world by Complan or by the ordinary therapeutic effects of massage. In fact, he was so thin that the massages were no longer actual massages, but were more soothing caresses, which could be given only by faithful, surrendered servants. When one day Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked Prabhupāda if he felt he could stay for five weeks until the temple opening, he replied, “If you encourage me.”\nWhen Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked Prabhupāda if he would see any important guests, Prabhupāda replied that he would only see Mr. Bhogilal Patel and Mr. Mahadevia if they came. A few minutes later, as if summoned, Mr. Mahadevia showed up and was brought before Prabhupāda. Although usually very talkative, Mr. Mahadevia seemed too shocked by Śrīla Prabhupāda’s appearance to speak as freely as usual. At Prabhupāda’s request, however, he described the present political climate in India.\nPrabhupāda asked to be raised up, and he showed an unusual amount of interest in the report. “They’re missing the point,” he said. “The whole world is. This is the disease of the body. One party is no better than the other. It is stool, one side or the other. What they can do?”\nAlthough Prabhupāda was not able to go down to the temple for seeing Rādhā-Rāsavihārī, he daily asked to see Their picture, which he would look upon lovingly. He could also hear theārati-kīrtanascoming from the temporary temple. Then one day he asked that the framed picture of Rādhā-Rāsavihārī be fixed to his bedpost so that he could see Them always.\nJayapatāka Swami arrived from Māyāpur, asking Śrīla Prabhupāda to sign a legal statement concerning the recent attack on the ISKCON center in Māyāpur. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said that Prabhupāda had already written his will, stating that everything in his name belonged to ISKCON; he didn’t want anything further to do with management. Śrīla Prabhupāda confirmed this, saying, “Now there is no other way but to make me completely aloof from all management.”\nPrabhupāda wanted to stay absorbed in hearing the holy name and theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.He liked to sit up in bed, wearing his reading spectacles and looking at the photo of Rādhā-Rāsavihārī, while a devotee read aloud fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.For hours at a time he would meditate in this way, hearing and seeing Kṛṣṇa. This was the medicine he desired. Those who observed him in this way could understand that he was completely transcendental to thoughts of his body and that he was relishing the reading with great relief. When Tamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested that these readings go on each day, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “This is the most important thing. Read as much as possible.”\nOne evening, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Brahmānanda recounted to Prabhupāda the history of his purchasing the Bombay land. Prabhupāda lay, listening carefully to each word of the narration of his tolerance and triumph over many obstacles.\nAt one point, Prabhupāda interjected, “That dog.” The devotees paused, not knowing what he meant. Was he referring to the landlord or one of the politicians? But then he made it clear. He said that when he had stayed at the house of Mr. Sethi, he would have to ride each morning in Mr. Sethi’s car to the beach, and he would have to sit next to Mr. Sethi’s big German shepherd. Śrīla Prabhupāda continued to talk, and as he did, both Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Brahmānanda realized that he was still conducting a battle. He was fighting for the strength to go on preaching for Rādhā-Rāsavihārī, if They desired. At the end of the recitation, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa offered his obeisances and said, “All glories to Kṛṣṇa’s great soldier!”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa began by making various comments in favor of going to Vṛndāvana. He directed his comments to Prabhupāda and pointed out that even if Prabhupāda were to remain in Bombay in his present condition, he would not be able to attend any of the functions. Also, Prabhupāda was known for his powerful speaking and preaching, and it would not be fitting for the public to see him in his present condition. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa also pointed out that Prabhupāda could come back to visit after the temple opening. Prabhupāda heard these remarks without commenting.\nBrahmānanda Swami said that Śrīla Prabhupāda should definitely go to Vṛndāvana. Hari-śauri spoke next, saying that he felt it was difficult to decide but that it depended upon how strongly Prabhupāda desired to stay in Bombay as opposed to doing the best thing for his health. “It is for health,” Prabhupāda replied, and Hari-śauri immediately said he was in favor of Prabhupāda’s returning to Vṛndāvana.\nGopāla Kṛṣṇa, however, thought that it would be better if Prabhupāda remained in Bombay until after the opening. How could he leave Bombay after so many arrangements had been made and so many important guests had been invited? Surabhi also voted for Prabhupāda’s staying in Bombay, because he wanted Prabhupāda to see the temple being opened. He said that if Prabhupāda went to Vṛndāvana, he might not come back.\nThen Girirāja spoke. Each day in Bombay was very difficult for Prabhupāda, he said, and each successive day would be even more difficult. And the noise from the construction was constant. Therefore, Girirāja concluded, waiting three weeks would be too risky. As Girirāja spoke, Śrīla Prabhupāda moved his head in affirmation. But for the most part Prabhupāda was noncommittal, asking a question now and then, but mostly listening. For the devotees, the mood was very tense and momentous. Abhirāma spoke next, in favor of going to Vṛndāvana. Upendra said he didn’t know.\nIf Prabhupāda’s purpose in asking for opinions had been to get a majority vote, the decision had gone in favor of leaving Bombay. Even as they discussed, the hammering and chiseling noises were constant and almost drowned the sound of Prabhupāda’s voice.\nPrabhupāda wanted to also discuss the best course of treatment. His friend Dr. Ghosh had written recently, and Prabhupāda asked Tamāla Kṛṣṇa to read the letter. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa then read aloud Dr. Ghosh’s advice that Prabhupāda should go to a good hospital for a thorough check-up and treatment. Almost with the attitude of an impartial judge asking for discussion, Prabhupāda said, “So what is wrong with this proposal?”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa mentioned that the doctors would probably want to give intravenous feeding. Prabhupāda replied, “What is the use of artificial feeding when there is no digestion?” Making a point in favor of the hospital, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa then remarked that although Ayurvedic medicine was perfect, the practitioners have lost the science in the present day and are mostly quacks, whereas allopathic medicine, although imperfect, has many expert practitioners. Prabhupāda conceded.\n“Well, Prabhupāda,” said Upendra, “the doctor should come, but only here in your house. You should never go to the hospital.” Abhirāma was even stronger about Prabhupāda’s not going to the hospital. They already knew that Prabhupāda was not in favor of going to the hospital, and that in fact he had already made up his mind to go to Vṛndāvana. They took it that in his kindness and mercifulness he wanted to consult them and give them the opportunity to decide. At least apparently he was submitting himself to their decisions. But some of them got an eerie, uneasy feeling in thinking his well-being could be the subject of their argumentation.\nFinally Prabhupāda concluded, “The hospital is not a guarantee, but we take it as up-to-date scientific knowledge. My Godbrother Tīrtha Mahārāja had to undergo all these treatments, and they were very proud that he died with the best scientific treatment. My Guru Mahārāja, however, did not like it when he was given injection. He objected, saying, “Why are you giving?” Going to a hospital means giving in to the mercy of the material scientists. Whatever they like, they will do. They cannot guarantee, and we cannot be confident. And going to Vṛndāvana – whatever may happen, let Kṛṣṇa do it. Hospital is a chance technique. Going to Vṛndāvana, I have no objections. But now there is a dilemma – I am neither dying nor living.”\nWhen Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked whether the Vṛndāvanakavirājawas any better than the present one in Bombay, Prabhupāda replied, “Better or worse, some husband must be there.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa then offered a new argument. As long as Prabhupāda was in Bombay waiting for the opening, he said, then he would have a reason for living. But if he returned to Vṛndāvana, it would mean he was going there to die. So on that basis, Prabhupāda should remain in Bombay, since it would help give him motivation to live. Śrīla Prabhupāda smiled and said, “That is sentiment.”\nNow that Prabhupāda sounded so convinced, there was no alternative. There was no question of the devotees controlling him; only Kṛṣṇa could. Some of the alternatives had been frightening, and certainly the idea of voting about Prabhupāda had been. Now some of the devotees laughed nervously, relieved to hear Prabhupāda’s final decision.\n“Vṛndāvana,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Let’s go.”\n“Yes, Prabhupāda,” said Surabhi.\n“But Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “what will happen to all the devotees here? They have been serving you so sincerely. How will they be able to open the temple without you being here? I mean, all the devotees, when they hear you are going to Vṛndāvana, they will all want to come. They won’t want to stay here. Then they will all want to leave their posts and come with you to Vṛndāvana.”\n“Yes, then let them come,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “I have no objection.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa mentioned that if a thousand devotees might come to be with Prabhupāda, that would slow down the ISKCON work all over the world. Prabhupāda again said he had no objection. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked whether it was compulsory for the G.B.C. members to come, and Prabhupāda affirmed that it was.\nThere were no more questions, and the devotees excused themselves to go and make immediate preparations for Prabhupāda’s moving to Vṛndāvana. Only Kulādri remained in the room with Prabhupāda.\n“So, Kulādri,” asked Prabhupāda, “what do you think?” Kulādri had been disturbed by the fact that some of the devotees had seemed to be opposing Prabhupāda’s desire and even arguing against him.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said, “I don’t really understand. How can they give you advice like that? I feel like an intruder. I shouldn’t even be here. But it seems to me that you are waiting for Kṛṣṇa to make some decision on whether you stay or go.”\n“What?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“It seems you are waiting for Kṛṣṇa’s decision,” said Kulādri. “If you are going to wait for Kṛṣṇa’s decision, that might as well be in Vṛndāvana.” Prabhupāda smiled and closed his eyes. “Yes,” he said, “that is very good advice.”"

        "chapter_title": "At Home in Vṛndāvana",
        "content": "PRABHUPĀDA TRAVELED BY train from Bombay to Mathurā. Brahmānanda carried him in his arms from the train to a waiting car, and within fifteen to twenty-five minutes Prabhupāda was back in Vṛndāvana.\nThe devotees at the Krishna-Balaram Mandir were upset to see that Prabhupāda’s condition had deteriorated so much in the one month he had been away. His room was as he had left it, except for the addition of a large double bed. He lay down, and they closed the curtains and dimmed the lights. For about five minutes he lay still, with his eyes closed.\n“Now you are home, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\nStill Śrīla Prabhupāda lay quietly, not moving. Then slowly he brought his hands to his chest, clasped them together, and said, “Thank you.” He seemed relieved.\n“Now you are in the care of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda smiled and nodded slightly. “Yes,” he said. “Kṛṣṇatvadīya-pada-paṅkaja-pañjarāntam,” indicating King Kulaśekhara’s prayer to Lord Kṛṣṇa: “My dear Kṛṣṇa, please help me die immediately so that the swan of my mind may be encircled by the stem of Your lotus feet. Otherwise, at the time of my final breath, how will it be possible for me to think of You?”\nAlthough Śrīla Prabhupāda was in a precarious state, he remained completely fixed in thought of Kṛṣṇa in one way or another – Kṛṣṇa’s name, His form, His pastimes, or His devotional service. Prabhupāda suggested going to see Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma at nine-thirty, just as he had done before, but his servants advised that he rest today and begin that program tomorrow. “Whatever you desire, I will do,” Prabhupāda said.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa asked Prabhupāda if he wanted thekavirājato come.\n“As you said, Prabhupāda, for better or worse, some husband must be there.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda nodded. “Now manage everything,” he said, “and let me think of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.”\nA little before four in the afternoon, while devotees were reading aloud fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,Prabhupāda asked if the temple bell had rung the hour. Ever since the temple opening in 1975, he had insisted that the bell at the front gate be rung every hour to signify the hour and once every half hour. At first, the temple president had been unable to get a watchman who would remain awake through the night and ring the bell regularly. But Śrīla Prabhupāda had insisted so strongly that the temple management had finally established the bell-ringing. For Śrīla Prabhupāda, it was more than just a good standard; it was a symbol of the entire temple management’s effectiveness. If they couldn’t even arrange that the bell be rung regularly, then how could they manage everything else? Now Śrīla Prabhupāda was saying he thought he heard the bell ring at the wrong time. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa explained it might have been a different bell, and the devotees continued readingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.But Śrīla Prabhupāda again asked about the bell in the temple dome. As Hari-śauri rose to go out and check, the bell began loudly ringing – one… two… three… four – properly sounding the hour.\n“That is my concern,” said Prabhupāda, “that such a huge establishment is properly managed. If not properly managed, then everything will be finished.”\n“I don’t think that that’s going to happen,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “We are too much indebted to you to allow what you have established to become spoiled.”\n“Please see to that,” said Prabhupāda.\nNevertheless, Śrīla Prabhupāda called for Akṣayānanda Swami and, as soon as he came into the room, inquired from him, “Will the bell ring or not?” Akṣayānanda promised to diligently see to it, taking the instruction very seriously, as perhaps his last order from his spiritual master.\nThepūjārīentered and gave Prabhupāda a large, fragranttulasīgarland from Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma, and Prabhupāda returned to listening to the reading.\nLater in the day, he confided to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa about the past few weeks. “I must thank you,” he said, “that you took me to London and again brought me here without any difficulty. That is a great credit for you. For that I am thanking you. In this condition, a bundle of bones – still you did it. Kṛṣṇa will bless you.”\nHari-śauri had obtained another detailed astrological chart on Śrīla Prabhupāda from Delhi. This astrologer recommended amantrato Lord Śiva to be chanted by tenbrāhmaṇasfor twenty-one days.\n“We have themahā-mantra,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “There is no need of others.” He spoke disapprovingly of the suggestion.\n“Are these astrological charts very much applicable for devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda?” asked Hari-śauri.\n“No,” said Prabhupāda. “Don’t waste money for this astrology.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s faith was only inkīrtana.Tamāla Kṛṣṇa suggested they again have continuouskīrtana,and Prabhupāda said, “That is real business. These astrologers arekarmīs.We have nothing to do with thekarmīs.”\nIn response to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s call, the twenty-three G.B.C. members again began gathering in Vṛndāvana. They arrived heavy-hearted, yet on coming before Śrīla Prabhupāda they were pleased to give him progress reports on their preaching on his behalf. Śrīla Prabhupāda was happy to hear the reports and was as encouraging as ever to his leaders, despite his condition.\nHaṁsadūta Swami was one of the first to arrive, from Sri Lanka. Śrīla Prabhupāda instructed him to develop farm projects there, as Kīrtanānanda Swami had done in New Vrindaban. “Sometimes when preaching,” said Haṁsadūta, “I tell them, ‘What kind of country is this? The land is of therājarṣis,and some lady is running the government!’ ”\n“Do not touch politics,” Prabhupāda warned. “We are cultural and philosophy.”\nPrabhupāda began dealing with Girirāja over bank matters. The local Vṛndāvana bank was reluctant to allow a withdrawal from an ISKCON fund, and Śrīla Prabhupāda had to be called in for advice. He gave keen, practical strategy for solving the problem, but he asked to be spared these things in the future. Devotees in the room were amazed to see Prabhupāda still dealing expertly with such affairs. When Girirāja apologized to Prabhupāda for involving him, Prabhupāda replied, “Therefore I said, do the needful.”\nActually, Prabhupāda’s calling the G.B.C. men together had been so they could chant for him. Now, more than ever, he wanted the medicine of the holy name, not of the doctors. When he heard that his friend Dr. Ghosh was coming to Vṛndāvana to open a clinic and that he could prescribe treatment, he refused the offer. “These doctors will come and give something to try and save,” he said. “I don’t want to be saved. Dr. Ghosh may come for the clinic he wants to develop, but not for my treatment.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked if they could at least call in some local Vṛndāvana doctors.\n“No,” said Prabhupāda. “Let us take your advice forkīrtanaonly.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa agreed thatkīrtanawas best, because in that way they were pleading for Kṛṣṇa’s help.\n“Better you don’t pray to Kṛṣṇa to save me,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Let me die now.” Prabhupāda then asked to sit up. “If Haṁsadūta is not tired,” he said, “he can continue singing.”\n“This is not the kind of mood we are trying to create here,” the devotee explained.\n“What? Are you crazy?” exclaimed Harikeśa. “Books are Prabhupāda’s life and soul!” He went in and showed Prabhupāda the seven new books. Immediately Prabhupāda took the first volume of theKṛṣṇatrilogy and held it up, looking at the cover painting of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda began crying and reached out, trying to stroke Harikeśa’s head. Harikeśa reached out and held Śrīla Prabhupāda’s hand, thinking himself unworthy of being patted.\n“He was rotting here, typewriting,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, referring to when Harikeśa had been his secretary, just before going to preach in Europe. “I said, ‘You go.’ I had ten servants. You thought that I was degrading you by sending you away. No. Now you understand?”\n“Yes, I understand,” said Harikeśa, sobbing.\n“Here is an intelligent boy, I thought,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “Why should he rot here, typewriting?” Prabhupāda looked at each book. “Printing and everything is first class,” he said. He asked how many had been printed, and Harikeśa replied, “One hundred twenty thousandKṛṣṇatrilogies, sixty thousandŚrīmad-BhāgavatamSecond Cantos, and ten thousandĪśopaniṣads.”\n“Can you distribute thatĪśopaniṣad?” Prabhupāda asked. Harikeśa assured him that they could definitely distribute the book in Yugoslavia.\n“Then print more,” said Prabhupāda. They continued discussing book production. Books were indeed Śrīla Prabhupāda’s life and soul. From Harikeśa’s entering with the new books, Prabhupāda had felt a profound ecstasy that had spread to Harikeśa and all the devotees present. Everyone was keenly aware that what they were experiencing was transcendental, a special reciprocation with Śrīla Prabhupāda, and as long as they were sincere it would not die.\n“Now you just have to become better,” said Harikeśa. “More healthy.”\n“Healthy?” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “I have nothing to do with this body.”\n“With Nava-yogendra,” Prabhupāda said in a hoarse whisper, “the both of you. South Africa also. There gradually the people are taking. Try to bring Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa back. He is very competent. So jointly organize Africa. Havesaṅkīrtana.All Europeans, Americans, Africans. Tulasī dāsa is very competent also. United Nations under Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s flag. It is possible. Otherwise, that United Nations will be simply false attempt.”\n“You said that when you first came to New York,” replied Brahmānanda, urgently recalling his first days with Śrīla Prabhupāda, “you went to the United Nations. The very first day I came to thekīrtanathere in New York. The next day you went for that peace vigil outside the United Nations, and you were chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and saying that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only method for making United Nations.”\n“That is a fact,” said Prabhupāda. “Try for the protection of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and things will be successful. Others, they will simply waste time and be disappointed and change the body and suffer.” Prabhupāda changed the subject, but Brahmānanda was satisfied. He had been given enough service for many lifetimes.\n“So, why don’t you find out some bride?” Śrīla Prabhupāda remarked, and the devotees’ sudden laughter broke the room’s solemn mood. Accepting the ring on his finger, Śrīla Prabhupāda said someone should take care of the other valuables.\nKulādri said he had also one request to make on behalf of Kīrtanānanda Swami: “Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja said that you have asked us to pray to Kṛṣṇa before. But he says he doesn’t feel qualified to pray to Kṛṣṇa. So he is asking that you please pray to Kṛṣṇa for us, because we cannot pray to Kṛṣṇa directly. We don’t know Kṛṣṇa. But ifyouask, Kṛṣṇa must be sure to fulfill your desire. So would you please pray to Kṛṣṇa to stay with us? We want you to come to the palace that we’re building in New Vrindaban, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if it is possible.”\n“I wish,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “But unless I become a little strong, how can I go?”\n“We’ve also brought some sweets and ice cream,” said Kulādri. He knew that Prabhupāda could not take it, but he asked if he could just at least take a little taste. Prabhupāda agreed, and a small piece of the ice cream was put on his tongue. “First class,” he said.\nLater Kīrtanānanda arrived, and Prabhupāda asked for a report on New Vrindaban.\n“Everything is going very nicely, Prabhupāda,” said Kīrtanānanda. “Your palace is almost finished. Already many people are coming every day to see it. It will be finished in a couple of months. The other day a lady went in, and she turned to one of her boys and said, ‘I cannot tell you what I am feeling. It is so wonderful.’ ”\n“Yes,” said Prabhupāda. “It is wonderful in that quarter.” He paused, reflecting. “Hmm … Let us see which palace I am going to.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda asked Kīrtanānanda to take back his valuable gifts and use them for New Vrindaban. “You require money,” said Prabhupāda, “so you take back and utilize it there. That is my request.”\n“Thank you very much,” said Kīrtanānanda. “Most of all we want you, though.”\n“Yes, I also,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “And if I survive, I have a strong desire to go where you are and live there. It will be a great pleasure.”\nKīrtanānanda had pictures of the palace, and Prabhupāda sat up to see them. “You are fulfilling my dream,” he said. “New Vrindaban. I dreamt all these things. Wonderful things he has done. He is the first student – from the very beginning. When I was in the storefront, he was bringing carpets, bench, some gong, some lamps.”\n“Do you think this movement can go on without me?” Prabhupāda asked. Girirāja was astounded that Prabhupāda had called him in the middle of the night to ask him this.\n“I think,” said Girirāja, “that as long as we are sincere and go on chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and follow the principles, the movement will be successful.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was silent. When he spoke, each word seemed to come with great effort. He uttered the wordorganization.Then he said, “Organization and intelligence. Is there anything else?”\nGirirāja felt within his heart that he wanted to cry out, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, stay with us.” But instead he said, “No.”\n“All right,” Prabhupāda said. And Girirāja offered obeisances and left. Outside Prabhupāda’s room, Girirāja continued to reflect on Prabhupāda’s words – “organization and intelligence.” Prabhupāda seemed to be demanding much more love and commitment; not that ISKCON could survive on organization and intelligence alone. Girirāja was thinking that perhaps these might be the last words Prabhupāda would ever speak to him.\n“We’re always feeling your presence very strongly, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Paramānanda. “Simply by your teachings and instructions. We are always meditating on your instructions.”\n“Thank you,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “That is the real presence. Physical presence is not important.” Paramānanda had brought a letter from his wife, Satyabhāmā. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked if he should read it, and Prabhupāda agreed. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa read on.\n“Thank her,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he reached for the shawl. “Made with our wool.”\n“So you’ll take rest now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?” suggested Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\n“Umhm,” said Prabhupāda. “This can be on the foot.” And he gestured that the saffron-colored shawl be put as a blanket on his bed. Tears came from his eyes as he lay back.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was becoming more and more in favor of departing from the world. When Tamāla Kṛṣṇa remarked that Prabhupāda was not drinking much, he replied that he had no inclination.\n“I don’t know what to say, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “It’s certainly bewildering. I can only expect somehow Kṛṣṇa will have to do something.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa requested again that they bring a doctor. “Still some husband must be there, you said,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa reminded. “We should have a doctor’s help. I still believe that. After all, we are not doctors.”\n“No,” said Prabhupāda, “but we are already taking help of doctor,Āyur Veda– that isYogendra-Ras.”\n“You’re just beginning that now, of course,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “Tomorrow you might give it up. Then what will be our position?”\n“Widow,” said Prabhupāda with a laugh. Then he added, “Actually, Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate husband.”\nThe devotees with Prabhupāda found it very difficult to adopt his mood of looking forward to his passing away. Once during akīrtana,Upendra asked if Prabhupāda wanted something to drink. When Prabhupāda refused, some of the devotees began to cry, thinking that if Prabhupāda didn’t eat or even drink, he would not remain with them much longer. The devotees were trying to be submissively resigned to Prabhupāda’s will, and they accepted that his direction was more and more toward leaving. They were coming to accept it, surrounding him withkīrtanaand not causing him any inconvenience with their problems or demands. Whatever he wanted, they should want. But the idea of his passing away was still almost unbearable.\nIn their resignation, the devotees became philosophical. Rūpānuga said Prabhupāda could be likened to an ambassador in a foreign country. He may have many affairs in the foreign country, but finally he’s called back. Jayādvaita said that Prabhupāda had taught his disciples everything and that now he was teaching them how to die. Another devotee said that Prabhupāda had better friends in the spiritual world. In their talks, the devotees stressed the importance of their cooperating with one another, and they discussed how ISKCON would continue in the future. But it was all depressing.\nNevertheless, they kept returning to the unpleasant but unavoidable realization that Prabhupāda would very soon leave them. With Prabhupāda so clearly indicating that he had decided to definitely leave, the devotees were becoming despondent. At best, a solemn mood prevailed.\nThen Śrīla Prabhupāda said they should consult Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja, a disciple of Prabhupāda’ssannyāsa-guru,for details on how to conduct the ceremony for a departed Vaiṣṇava. He also described where hissamādhishould be located and asked that after his departure, a feast be served in all the main temples in Vṛndāvana, with ISKCON bearing the expense. On one level, everything seemed to go on as usual. The October weather was very pleasant. Thegurukulaboys were continuing with their routine, and the Deity worship went on as usual. But in front of the temple, workmen began clearing a space for Prabhupāda’ssamādhi.\n“Let me drinkhari-nāma amīya vilāsa,*” said Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“JayaŚrīla Prabhupāda,” said Hari-śauri. “Hari-nāmais the sweetest nectar.”\n“Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād bhavauṣadhāt,*” Prabhupāda quoted. “This isbhavauṣadha, hari-kīrtana.”\nJayādvaita completed the verse: “Bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-’bhirāmāt.”\n“Ah,” Prabhupāda acknowledged. “Andcaraṇāmṛta –diet. Diet and medicine. Let me depend on these.”\nAlthough he was fasting, Śrīla Prabhupāda inquired about theprasādambeing served to the devotees. Now a hundred or more extra devotees were at the temple, and more were expected.\n“This time, what do they supply?” asked Prabhupāda.\n“What they supply?” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “You meanprasāda?Of course, today is the day after Ekādaśī, so they had some cereal made with gur and some fruit salad made with guavas and bananas. That was all this morning. Lunch is usually substantial, very good. This is the bestprasādamthat we have had in many years in India. The cook, Ayodhyāpati, is doing very nicely. Do you want to know what he cooks for lunch?”\nPrabhupāda nodded slightly.\n“He cooks anālu-sabjiwithdālsauce,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa continued, “and he makesbindi,very nicely spiced, anddāl, rotī,rice, apple chutney, anddahi-raitāevery day.”\nPrabhupāda asked who assisted Ayodhyāpati. He didn’t want any hired cooks.\n“Only devotees are cooking,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “And it is very tasteful. And everybody – about 125 devotees – sits together and takesprasādam.And the guests from the guesthouse also take. Everyone takes together.”\n“Everybody liked?” asked Prabhupāda, smiling.\n“Yes, oh, yes,” was the combined reply of the devotees in the room. They all crowded close around Prabhupāda’s bed.\n“That’s nice,” said Prabhupāda.\n“You are the perfect father, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said one of the devotees. “You provide everything for us. A place to live, food to eat, everything. And you’ve trained us in spiritual knowledge.”\nPrabhupāda uttered one of his deep sounds – “Hmmm.” Then he said, “Chant. All together.” And the assembled devotees gladly began akīrtana.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda began, “Śrīla Prabhupāda [Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī] said that we should preach in Europe, America. That was his desire. And his other desire was that we all would work together jointly to preach.”\n“Yes, that is right,” said Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja.\n“I didn’t waste a single moment,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “I tried my best, and it has been successful to some extent.” Śrīla Prabhupāda’s voice was choked with emotion. “If we work conjointly,” he continued, “then as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,pṛthivīte*…Saṅkīrtanahas great possibilities. My life is coming to an end. It is my desire that you all forgive me for my mistakes. My Godbrothers, when you are preaching at times there are some disputes, some misunderstandings. Maybe I also committed some offenses like that. Please ask them to forgive me. When I am gone, you will all sit together and decide how you can manage for someutsava,or festival for me. How much should we pay? What do you think of this?”\n“Whatever instructions you give me,” said Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja, “I will follow them with absolute sincerity. I consider you myguru.”\nNārāyaṇa Mahārāja said that what Śrīla Prabhupāda had created should be protected, and it was everyone’s duty to do so. He pledged to help in whatever way he could. Śrīla Prabhupāda inquired if his Godbrothers who had temples in Mathurā-Vṛndāvana were present, and Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja replied that most of them were out of station.\nRegarding Śrīla Prabhupāda’s asking his Godbrothers for forgiveness, Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja said, “They are all trivial things. In this worldwide preaching, if some little things go wrong here and there, what difference does it make? It is all right. Whatever you have done, you have done for the well-being of the entire human society. There is no individual interest. Everything was done in the interest of God.” He advised that Śrīla Prabhupāda not worry. His disciples were worthy and would maintain things; therefore Prabhupāda should now simply “think of the Lord.”\nNārāyaṇa Mahārāja then asked his assistant, Śeṣaśāyī Brahmacārī, to singŚrī-rūpa-mañjarī-pada.While everyone listened in silence and Śrīla Prabhupāda lay still, Śeṣaśāyī Brahmacārī sang the song very sweetly. Next, Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja sang abhajana,finishing with the refrainJayaGurudeva!JayaPrabhupāda!\nAfter a pause, Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja spoke again, this time referring to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disciples. “They should be told that they should never get motivated by their own self-interest,” he said. “They should make your mission successful.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda turned his head slowly, looking over the devotees as they gathered in even more closely. Then slowly he lifted his hand, as if to call them all to attention, and said, “Do not fight among yourselves. I have given direction in my books.” He then lowered his hand.\nPrabhupāda’s Godbrother Indupati entered the room. Śrīla Prabhupāda heard his greeting and repeated his request: “First of all I want to say forgive me for all my offenses. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, but while preaching one has to sometimes say something that may offend others. Will you forgive me?”\n“Yes, yes,” Indupati said.\n“Mahārāja, you didn’t commit any offense,” said Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja. “We never thought that you did anything wrong. On the other hand, you bless us. We need it. You never did any wrong. If someone is offended by your actions, that is his fault.”\nNārāyaṇa Mahārāja then gently took Śrīla Prabhupāda’s right hand and felt his pulse. After a moment or two he said, “Pulse is all right. And your consciousness is perfect. If you have to go, by the will of the Lord, then you will go perfectly.” Promising to return again, Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja asked permission to leave, and he and Indupati and their party left the room.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s disciples moved back and remained silent, not wanting to instigate any conversation to unnecessarily tax Prabhupāda. They appreciated Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja’s words, but it was another final goodbye. Before the atmosphere of despair could engulf them, they began again their soft, singingkīrtana.\n“What is wrong if I don’t drink?” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied. “I feel no inconvenience.” Upendra added that if Śrīla Prabhupāda didn’t drink, his body would become dehydrated. Prabhupāda made no reply, and Upendra left the room.\n“What about water?” Abhirāma asked.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda thought for a moment and said, “So you discuss among yourselves and decide what you want me to do.”\nDiscuss? He seemed to be speaking of more than the merits of drinking water.“Discuss about recovery?” asked Abhirāma.\n“I don’t want,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“You say you don’t want recovery, Śrīla Prabhupāda?”\n“Yes,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. Abhirāma then went to the outer room, the secretary’s reception room, where some of the G.B.C. men were sitting together. He dutifully mentioned what Śrīla Prabhupāda had just said – to discuss among themselves about his recovery. But Abhirāma’s remark didn’t seem like news. The devotees were already well aware that Prabhupāda was making almost no attempt to carry on. They were resigned to it. Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted to leave now, to “die peacefully.” They had been trying to encourage him to drink, but now he was determined to simply fast until the right time came. Whether they could accept it or not, it was happening. Therefore Abhirāma’s comment provoked no formal discussion.\nThat afternoon Prabhupāda called for Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, who was at that time taking his lunch. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa responded at once and entered the room along with several other G.B.C. men. They all came very close to hear what Prabhupāda wanted to say.\n“If I want to survive,” he said, “of course I’ll have to take something.” His words came slowly, but with difficulty. “It is not possible to survive without taking any food. But my survival means so many inconveniences, one after another. Therefore I have decided to die peacefully.” His voice trailed off, and everyone was too stunned to speak. They sat looking almost blankly at him as he lay with his eyes closed. He occasionally made a noise like “ummm,” and only after several very long minutes did Tamāla Kṛṣṇa manage to ask Prabhupāda if they should continue with thekīrtana.By this time, more devotees, having finished lunch, were entering the room, and they began softly singingkīrtana.Tamāla Kṛṣṇa leaned forward and assured Prabhupāda about the stipend payments for his former family. Prabhupāda acknowledged.\n“Don’t worry,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “I’ll see that each of them is satisfied. They won’t feel sorry in any way. You’ve provided for everyone, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\nAfter a few minutes, Prabhupāda turned his attention to Hari-śauri, who was sobbing silently near Prabhupāda’s head. With some sternness in his voice, Prabhupāda asked, “Why do you want me to survive?” Hari-śauri could not speak. He felt that if he asked Prabhupāda to stay it would be an offense, since he had already decided to leave. Hari-śauri could not keep his emotions in check, and yet he did not want to say, “Stay and struggle.” Neither did he nor any of the others want Prabhupāda to leave. Somehow, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had not caught Prabhupāda’s last remark to Hari-śauri, and so he leaned forward towards Prabhupāda, half questioning, “They want you to survive?”\n“If I want to die,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “this is a very peaceful death. You go on chanting.”\nAs thekīrtanacontinued, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked to be excused. Prabhupāda asked why, and he replied he was going for discussion.\n“For discussion,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “They want me to survive, and I want to die peacefully. I cannot make miracles. The physical body has to be maintained if I am to survive. But without taking food, how the physical body will go on? That is fanaticism.”\n“Everything is in the hands of Kṛṣṇa,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s eyes had been closed, but suddenly he opened them and said, “Kṛṣṇa wants me to do as I like. The choice is mine. Kṛṣṇa has given me full freedom.”\nThese words struck some of the devotees as extremely startling and different. But Brahmānanda spoke up in the mood of resigned assurance. “It doesn’t matter whether you live or die, Prabhupāda,” he said. “You’ll always be with Kṛṣṇa, and we will always be with you, because we will follow your instructions.”\n“Whether I live or die,” Prabhupāda said, “I will always be Kṛṣṇa’s servant. So if Brahmānanda has assured me that this movement will go on, then better let me die peacefully.” The devotees, who were only inches away from Prabhupāda, heard these faint words with dismay. After a few minutes of heavy silence, they resumed thekīrtana.Prabhupāda seemed to rest.\nWithin a few minutes all the available G.B.C. men and seniorsannyāsīswere gathered in the outer room. Brahmānanda was feeling very low that he had told Prabhupāda that everything would go on without him and that Prabhupāda had replied that he would therefore die. The devotees remained amazed at Prabhupāda’s statement that Kṛṣṇa had given him freedom to do as he liked. These words now struck like a thunderbolt. With these words, “Kṛṣṇa has given me the choice,” Prabhupāda turned all the devotees’ minds in a different direction. Abhirāma reminded them that Prabhupāda wanted them to discuss about his recovery, and now they were having that discussion. But they were confused and bewildered by the sudden change in Prabhupāda’s mood.\nKīrtanānanda Swami, the seniormost disciple, spoke up with clarity and logic. “If Kṛṣṇa has given Śrīla Prabhupāda the independence to choose, that means He also has given us the independence. So we should assert our independence and ask Śrīla Prabhupāda to stay.”\nOne by one, devotees spoke up in support of the decision to ask Śrīla Prabhupāda to stay. Yes, it was a fact that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement would go on without Śrīla Prabhupāda’s physical presence; but it wouldn’t be the same.\n“Yes, and Prabhupāda hasn’t finished translating theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,” said Brahmānanda.\n“Yes,” said another, “we should ask Śrīla Prabhupāda to stay for at least five or ten years.”\n“Five or ten years? We should ask him to stay for one hundred years!”\n“But not all of the G.B.C. members are here to decide.”\n“Well, who in the G.B.C. is going to say that we shouldn’t ask Prabhupāda to stay?”\nThey were in agreement. Theydidwant Prabhupāda to stay, and they should express their desire to him. The mood of the last few days had suddenly reversed. They were no longer in the depths of despair but were thinking positively and enthusiastically that Śrīla Prabhupāda would stay with them.\n“Why should we think that there is no hope for him to become fit again?” said Kīrtanānanda. “Jesus could bring people back to life from the dead, and even mundaneyogīscan do it. So Śrīla Prabhupāda certainly can if he wants.”\nNow Brahmānanda spoke up with great strength. “We weren’t realizing that actually weneedPrabhupāda! That should be the understanding. There is no question of allowing Prabhupāda out of our presence for a moment!”\nIt was about 3:30 P.M. when the twenty devotees entered Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room and crowded around his bed. Śrīla Prabhupāda lay with his eyes closed, motionless, but alert to their presence. Kīrtanānanda Swami had been chosen to be the spokesman, and as he leaned over to speak to Śrīla Prabhupāda, his lips began to tremble, his eyes filled with tears, and he broke down, sobbing, with his head at the side of the bed. Śrīla Prabhupāda reached out but could not find Kīrtanānanda.\n“Who?” said Prabhupāda.\nMany voices spoke, “Kīrtanānanda.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then laid his hand on Kīrtanānanda’s head and gently rubbed it.\n“Hmmm? So what do you want?” he asked. No one could say anything, as they were all waiting for Kīrtanānanda. Brahmānanda was rubbing Kīrtanānanda on the back to soothe him, and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa was encouraging him to try to say something. Finally, after another minute of emotional waiting, Kīrtanānanda raised his head. He looked at Śrīla Prabhupāda and pleaded, “If Kṛṣṇa gives you the choice, then don’t go! We need you!”\n“So this is your joint opinion?” asked Śrīla Prabhupāda. “You have discussed?” He held his hand in the air and moved it around, so as to indicate all the devotees.\nBrahmānanda Swami spoke up very emotionally but positively: “We have all met together, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We want you to remain and lead this movement and finish theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.We said that you must remain for at least another ten years. You have only done fifty percent of your work.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda was listening very carefully without any movement, but when Brahmānanda said “fifty percent” he frowned and said, “No.” Finally he uttered a “Hmmm.” He was considering the proposal. His eyes were still closed, and he seemed to be consulting Kṛṣṇa from within himself. Several times he uttered “Hmmm,” and everyone was held in suspense, not able to speak or think or do anything except look intently at Śrīla Prabhupāda. Then with his eyes still closed, he yawned, and his gold teeth began to show. “All right,” he said.\nIt was probably the most casual-sounding decision on life or death ever made. At that moment the devotees understood Śrīla Prabhupāda’s independent position; he could stay or go as he chose. They had become so faithless, however, that they were thinking that his passing away was inevitable and could not possibly be delayed, even by Śrīla Prabhupāda himself. Now he displayed his wonderful transcendental nature with a simple yawn – “All right” – as if choosing between life and death was the most unimportant thing in the world. Harikeśa gave a short laugh, the kind that he saved for when Śrīla Prabhupāda did something completely transcendental, incomprehensible, and inimitable. “Jaya,Prabhupāda!” he said.\nPrabhupāda had again proven himself to be beyond understanding. The devotees laughed nervously, unsure what was appropriate. Not knowing whether to laugh or cry, they fell silent again to see what Prabhupāda would do.\n“So give me something to drink,” he said, and all the devotees shouted, “Jaya,Prabhupāda!” He would stay with them. It was confirmed. Everyone was greatly relieved. “All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!”\n“This is real affection,” Prabhupāda replied.\nThe atmosphere had changed. Śrīla Prabhupāda had changed. His servants lifted him up, and all the devotees watched as he drank a full glass of grape juice. Now, instead of withdrawing his energy, as he had done steadily for the last few days, he came back to life again. Then he lay back. “Thank you very much,” he said. “Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nAnd the devotees replied, “Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nSo this was what Prabhupāda wanted. He was drawing out their emotions and increasing their affection for him more and more by putting them into a state of transcendental distress. Now they could understand, at least to a tiny degree, what thegopīs’pangs of separation were like. Śrīla Prabhupāda was bringing his disciples to the extremes of devotional sentiments and showing that actuallytheirlives were inhishands.\nAfter a long pause he asked, “Strawberries, they have been brought?”\n“Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “very nice strawberries.”\n“I will take some strawberries,” he said.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said, “you gave your word to Kṛṣṇa in Bombay that you would see Him sitting in His new big temple, and you have yet to keep your word to Him.” Prabhupāda smiled very brightly.\n“You have fixed the date for the opening of Bombay,” said Brahmānanda. “January the first. So we would like to invite you to come, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It is your temple. You have asked Kṛṣṇa to come there. When we all gave up, you carried on the fight.”\n“Yes, that was a great fight,” said Prabhupāda, smiling. “After so much fighting and then to construct a big temple is a great triumph.”\n“I don’t think Kṛṣṇa will come into the temple,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “unless you are personally there, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to open the door.”\nPrabhupāda was still smiling. “All right,” he said. “But chanting should not be stopped. Things should go on naturally.”\nTurning to Kīrtanānanda, Prabhupāda asked, “Kīrtanānanda’s palace – when it will be ready?”\n“In early spring,” Kīrtanānanda replied, “as soon as the weather is a little warmer. It gives you the chance to have a little time to recuperate, then go to Bombay and open the temple there, and then you can come open your palace. We have about seventy-five letters from all the devotees in New Vrindaban, and they are all begging you to come. They say their life is finished if you don’t come.”\n“So let me take a little rest,” said Prabhupāda, “and then I shall take strawberries.”\nWord spread quickly to the devotees throughout the world that Prabhupāda had decided to live. Especially in Vṛndāvana, where gloom had pervaded, the devotees were now light-hearted and thankful. They spoke more enthusiastically about preaching. All the devotees in Vṛndāvana agreed that everything Śrīla Prabhupāda had been doing was for instructing his disciples. Previously there had been discussion of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s teaching them how to die, but now there was more awareness that he was teaching them how tolive –by love. He was doing this by increasing their love for him.\nSome of the devotees felt that the instruction Śrīla Prabhupāda was giving now was his ultimate instruction, the motive for everything he did. The basis for Kṛṣṇa consciousness was, in fact, love. Śrīla Prabhupāda had written in his books,prema pum-ārtho mahān:“Love of Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate goal of life.” Only when a devotee developed pure, unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa could he go to the spiritual world. Some of the devotees said that to bring all the devotees to a higher, purer love, Prabhupāda was remaining in the material world and offering his disciples the opportunity to serve him very intimately in Vṛndāvana. Other devotees, however, considered Śrīla Prabhupāda’s activities too grave for them to understand and simply accepted these pastimes asacintya,inconceivable. But everyone could at least understand, either by witnessing or hearing reports, that Śrīla Prabhupāda had responded to his disciples’ dependent cries of love by saying, “This is real affection.”"

        "content": "DESPITE HIS PROMISE to live, Śrīla Prabhupāda said his life was still in Kṛṣṇa’s hands – everything was. His free choice did not mean he was absolutely independent. Rather, the pure devotee’s attitude is to freely surrender to Kṛṣṇa, whatever happens. In the mood of thegopīs,the foremost devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu prayed, “You may handle me roughly in Your embrace or make me brokenhearted by not being present before me, but You are always my worshipable Lord, unconditionally.”\nBecause the exchanges between the Lord and His pure devotees are always supremely personal, both the Lord and His devotees express desires and individual will. In His childhoodlīlā,Kṛṣṇa sometimes breaks mother Yaśodā’s butter pot, and sometimes He allows her to catch Him and bind Him. In any case, the will of the Lord and the will of the devotee are always one in interest, but they are sometimes expressed in the form of a loving conflict. Similarly, although Śrīla Prabhupāda had promised his devotees that he would stay in the world and defy death, he still remained surrendered to the will of Kṛṣṇa.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had already expressed his surrender in the prayer he had given his disciples to offer on his behalf: “My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, if You desire, please cure Śrīla Prabhupāda.” By the phrase “if You desire,” he was reminding his followers of the supreme prerogative of Kṛṣṇa and was asking them to abide by it, although he was also giving them an acceptable way to petition Kṛṣṇa. In a similar case in 1967, he had given his disciples another prayer: “My master has not finished his work.” He had said then that Kṛṣṇa had responded to this prayer, granting the wishes of the devotees. Śrīla Prabhupāda himself was responding to the devotees’ prayers, and Kṛṣṇa had given him the choice. But as a surrendered soul, Śrīla Prabhupāda waited for further developments, ever sensitive to Kṛṣṇa’s desire. As Prabhupāda had said when invited by Kīrtanānanda to come to his palace in New Vrindaban, “Let us see which palace I am going to.”\nAs a loving tension can sometimes exist between the Supreme Lord and His pure devotee, so now a similar tension existed between Śrīla Prabhupāda and his followers. Prior to his disciples’ desperate petition at his bedside, Śrīla Prabhupāda had seen his duty as instructing his disciples in how to die. Part of his mission was to set the perfect example in this most important lesson – how to pass life’s ultimate test. But now his disciples were asking him to postpone the lesson in dying and stay with them indefinitely in the preaching field. And Prabhupāda had agreed, showing that he had the ability to live if he chose. But sooner or later he would have to return to the lesson on how a person should face the end of life.\nOne special feature of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s activities is his relating intimately to the human condition while at the same time remaining aloof and transcendental. As a pure devotee, he was not subjected to the law ofkarma,which awards reactions for pious and sinful deeds. He was not born by the force ofkarma,nor would he die by force ofkarma.As stated by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, “One whose body, mind, and words are fully engaged in devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa is a liberated soul, even while living in this world.” People often misunderstand the movements of a pure devotee within the material world, just as one, on seeing clouds blowing past the moon, may think the moon itself is moving. Theśāstra,therefore, warns us never to see theguruas an ordinary man subject tokarma.\nBut Śrīla Prabhupāda, while always transcendental to this world, showed the conditioned souls how they too could come to the stage of liberation by constantly thinking about Kṛṣṇa and serving Him, so that at the time of death they could return to Kṛṣṇa in the eternal, spiritual world. And Prabhupāda’s lessons were always practical and universal. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books, for example, were not mere theory but were practical and full of realized knowledge. And Prabhupāda practiced what he preached; his entire life was exemplary. He had been in family life, and even then he had vigorously preached, by starting hisBack to Godheadmagazine. In poverty and obscurity he had struggled to start a spiritual movement, and by the grace of Kṛṣṇa and his spiritual master, he had become successful. He had always shown by his humanlike attempts his willingness to bravely take on austerity and face danger. He had shown exemplary spiritual life for all to try and follow. He had gone alone, in old age, to a foreign country and had chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa in a park in New York City, attracting the young men and women of America. Therefore everyone should take his example and try to serve Kṛṣṇa, despite the immediate impediments. Śrīla Prabhupāda encountered obstacles, yet by his free will and the help of Kṛṣṇa, he surmounted them. This was his wonderful example. It is said that Lord Caitanya, five hundred years ago, made surrender to Kṛṣṇa more attainable than Lord Kṛṣṇa had five thousand years ago. And now, in the twentieth century, Śrīla Prabhupāda has made Kṛṣṇa consciousness possible for people all over the world.\nAs part of his instruction and example, Śrīla Prabhupāda knew he would have to show people just how to die. He had escaped death a number of times – by Kṛṣṇa’s grace, by the prayers of his disciples, and by his own pure and powerful will to propagate his movement. But from the signs given to him by Lord Kṛṣṇa in 1977, Śrīla Prabhupāda began decisively and conclusively ending his mission in the material world. And among his final duties was his giving complete guidelines on how to die. He was perfectly showing how to do that which everyone has to do, but which is most difficult to do successfully: die.\nBut a loving conflict was there. Prabhupāda loved his disciples. He also knew they were not yet fully mature. His movement already had great potency and stature in the world, and yet it had many enemies. He was inclined to always protect his devotees, his movement, and all living entities, even the animals. So when his most intimate and faithful disciples pleaded that they could not go on without him, he had turned from showing how to die, agreeing to stay with them and preach. But at what point would they ever be willing to let him go? At what point could he say that the world ofmāyāand the enemies of Kṛṣṇa were all gone? At what point would his disciples become fully mature?\nIn following his decision to stay, Śrīla Prabhupāda turned himself over to his disciples, allowing them to care for him completely. Those who took part recalled that never before had Śrīla Prabhupāda allowed such intimate dealings between himself and his disciples. The only thing comparable was in New York, in 1966, when he had been very intimate in dealing with the first persons to join him, persons who had known nothing of the etiquette of approaching a spiritual master. But those who were present now and who had also been present then said that these days were even more intimate.\nAt one point Kīrtanānanda firmly insisted that Śrīla Prabhupāda drink a full cup of juice, even when he said he had had enough. Kīrtanānanda felt awkward, insisting. “I am not like mother Yaśodā that I can do this,” he said. “I keep remembering that you are my spiritual master.” But Śrīla Prabhupāda allowed himself to be ordered by Kīrtanānanda. Similarly, Bhavānanda, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, Bhakti-caru, Upendra, and other servants coaxed Śrīla Prabhupāda to follow certain diets and cared for his body constantly. The other devotees were reminded of the story of Īśvara Purī, who gave intimate bodily service to his spiritual master, Mādhavendra Purī, when Mādhavendra was in the last stages of his life and apparently invalid. According to theCaitanya-caritāmṛta,it was by this menial, bodily service that Īśvara Purī proved his love for his spiritual master and was allowed to become the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had deferred the lessons in dying in favor of giving his disciples an unparalleled opportunity to serve him in pure and simple love. And he allowed this not only for a few, but for whoever came to Vṛndāvana. Many came, and all were allowed to enter Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, massage his body, and sit with him as long as they liked, day and night, chanting the holy name for his pleasure. Śrīla Prabhupāda also recommenced his translating, and this was done openly. Whereas previously he had always worked in solitude, he now encouraged all devotees to come as he lay in bed dictating his Bhaktivedanta purports. He was giving himself completely and declaring it also, telling the devotees present, “Never leave me,” and “I cannot live without your company.” They had asked him to stay, and he had agreed, consigning himself completely to their care.\nThose who were blessed to have this service felt themselves passing over all barriers of reluctance to serve, as well as all barriers of material desire. By intimately serving Śrīla Prabhupāda, they felt the strength of complete surrender and sensed that this would sustain them always, even when Śrīla Prabhupāda eventually did depart from the world.\nPrabhupāda also continued speaking, as he had in recent months, about being unafraid of death and being fixed in transcendental knowledge. When receiving a presentation of some of his books recently printed in Portuguese by Hṛdayānanda Goswami, Prabhupāda encouraged him and said, “This is life. The material world is just bones. The bones are not our real life. Our real concern is the living force. The bones may remain or go – it doesn’t matter. The real life is sustaining the bones. There is even a history that there was aṛṣiwho had only bones. So there is a science by which you can sustain life by only bones. Hiraṇyakaśipu did it.”\n“You are also doing it, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa said.\n“So take care of the bones as long as possible,” said Prabhupāda, “but the real life is here, always remember that. The material world means we are simply all protecting bones and flesh together. But they have no knowledge of what they are.”\nAnd when Ātreya Ṛṣi visited Śrīla Prabhupāda and asked that he visit Tehran, Prabhupāda said that he was ready to go, but “Now you have to take a bundle of bones.” These were, of course, the same themes that Prabhupāda had always taught, the same themes that were in his books. But the lessons were more poignant and striking when Prabhupāda applied them to his own situation.\nMore than one devotee compared Prabhupāda to Bhīṣmadeva, who gave important instructions in his last days. As Bhīṣma felt no pain and delivered learned and loving discourses even from his “bed of arrows,” and as Bhīṣma determined by his own will the time of his departure from the world, so Śrīla Prabhupāda spent his last days oblivious to his physical condition, defying death, and instructing his spiritually innocent sons. But Prabhupāda’s sons could no longer stand by and simply hear the philosophical lessons. Prabhupāda had accepted their affection when they had cried for him to stay with them, and now they wanted to express that affection in the only world they understood, a world with Śrīla Prabhupāda living and talking with them, laughing or reprimanding them, as he liked. They wanted him to eat and drink and become physically strong again.\nBut again Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed to change, and he began refusing food and drink. He had postponed his passing away to exchange lovingly with his disciples, and yet at the same time, by refusing to eat or drink, he was showing his preference for passing away. He admitted, when pressed, that it was an impossible course of action – to live without food or drink. Nor did he expect or want miracles. If he was to get better, it would be by taking nourishment. But for reasons of his own, he would not eat. He said recovery was material, and he didn’t want it.\nHe kept closely in tune with the will of Kṛṣṇa, allowing the holy name to sustain him. The doctors who came were often puzzled, but those who were Vaiṣṇavas understood and respected his prerogative. Prabhupāda’s servants made anxiety-filled attempts to induce Prabhupāda to take regular treatment. But Prabhupāda preferred to take onlykīrtanaandBhāgavatam,while at the same time sustaining a willingness to live. He empathized with his disciples’ anxiety and patiently explained the puzzling situation they were in. He wanted their care, and he allowed them to try and treat him, knowing that it was bringing them more and more into a surrender of love. But gradually it became more clear that Kṛṣṇa’s will was indicating Prabhupāda’s departure.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Bhavānanda coaxed, always working on the assumption that Prabhupāda could stay if he wanted, “your presence on this planet is the only thing that’s keeping the onslaught of the Kali-yuga from really taking effect. We have no idea even what will happen if you leave.”\n“It is not in my hands,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, with perfect clarity of consciousness. “Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda always spoke clearly, logically, and with complete devotion to Kṛṣṇa. Up until the last he dealt with practical matters, forming a Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust for reconstructing ancient temples in Bengal and arranging final details regarding ISKCON properties and monies. Through all dealings he stayed always alert, and he absorbed himself inkīrtanaandBhāgavatam.\nBut it became obvious to his disciples that, despite his promise, he was again moving inevitably towards giving the final lesson. He was teaching that love was beyond death, that a disciple’s love could call the spiritual master back to the world to stay, and that a pure devotee has the ability to stay in the world beyond his allotted time. Meanwhile, however, he was progressing steadily to the final point. The devotees didn’t feel angry with him or cheated that he was doing so. He had told them that he had free will given by Kṛṣṇa. And they also, by their free will, had asked him to stay, and he had agreed. But they knew he was not obliged. If, despite their prayers, Lord Kṛṣṇa was telling Śrīla Prabhupāda that he should come back home to Godhead, what could they do but accept? If Śrīla Prabhupāda was accepting, then they would accept also. Nothing, however, could change the fact of their surrendered love; it had now become a solid pact that could not be vanquished by any material changes. They had passed the test of eternal loving service, and that could not be taken away by death.\n“It doesn’t matter whether what she cooks does good to me or bad,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “She is a Vaiṣṇavī. It will be good for me.” He then began speaking in an extremely humble way. “Probably I became a little puffed up because of my opulence and success,” he said. “Now God has shattered that pride. If you don’t have your body, what is there to be puffed up about?”\nBhakti-caru Swami protested, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, whatever you have done, you have done for Kṛṣṇa.”\n“That may be, but in this world, unknowingly you commit offenses.”\nWhen Pisimā heard this, she exclaimed, “No, no, he never committed any offense.”\n“You cannot ever commit offenses,” said Bhakti-caru. “You are God’s very dear one. How can you commit offenses?”\n“I am a little temperamental,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “I used to use words likerascaland so on. I never compromised. They used to call it ‘A club in one hand and aBhāgavatamin the other.’ That is how I preach. Anyway, make arrangements for my sister.”\nThere were also visits from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Godbrothers, and again Prabhupāda asked forgiveness for his offenses. One time, Niṣkiñcana Kṛṣṇadāsa Bābājī, Purī Mahārāja, Āśrama Mahārāja, Ānanda Prabhu, Puruṣottama Brahmacārī, and about twenty others came and sat next to Prabhupāda’s bed. He was resting when they arrived, and they joined thekīrtanauntil he awoke. When he saw them, he asked to be raised up. Sitting in the center of his bed with his Godbrothers all around, he addressed them.\n“All over the world there is a beautiful field to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness,” he said. “I didn’t care whether I would be successful or not. People are willing to take. They are all taking also. If we preach together, the saying of Mahāprabhu,pṛthivīte,will come true. We have everything. Spread the holy name and distributeprasādam.There is a beautiful field. In Africa, in Russia, everywhere they’re accepting.”\nWhen Prabhupāda began asking his Godbrothers to forgive him, they protested. “You are the eternal leader,” one of them asserted. “You rule over us, guide us, and chastise us.”\n“Forgive all my offenses,” Prabhupāda repeated. “I became proud of all my opulence.”\n“No,” said Purī Mahārāja, “you never became proud. When you started preaching, opulence and success followed you. That was the blessing of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Śrī Kṛṣṇa. There cannot be any question of your being offensive.”\nWhen Śrīla Prabhupāda presented himself asmahā-patita,greatly fallen, Purī Mahārāja did not accept it. “You have saved millions of people around the world,” he said. “Therefore there is no question of offenses. But you should be calledmahā-patita-pāvana[the great savior of the fallen].”\nPrabhupāda’s disciples regarded Prabhupāda’s asking for his Godbrothers’ forgiveness as a manifestation of his humility. But they were also puzzled. Certainly Prabhupāda’s Godbrothers were sincere in saying Prabhupāda had committed no offense. Whatever he had done, he had done for Kṛṣṇa. But Śrīla Prabhupāda was also sincere in asking for forgiveness. That was the beautiful gem of his humility – to ask everyone for forgiveness.\nFor the purpose of preaching, displaying this gem had not always been the most effective way to spread the merciful teachings of Lord Kṛṣṇa in every town and village. But now it could be displayed. In London and now in Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda was showing his disciples extra affection and gratitude, without the reprimands usually necessary in training disciples. This attitude of complete humility was a symptom of the highest stage of devotional life. Śrīla Prabhupāda had explained in his books that themadhyama-adhikārī,the second-class devotee, makes distinctions between the devotees, the innocent nondevotees, and the demons, whereas themahā-bhāgavata,or first-class devotee, sees everyone – except himself –  as a servant of God. Sometimes, however, themahā-bhāgavatadesires to come down from the first-class platform to the second-class platform, just to take up the most compassionate service of preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Prabhupāda’s disciples had all read of themahā-bhāgavatastage in the scriptures, and now they were seeing it fully displayed, as Prabhupāda referred to himself as the most fallen and asked for everyone’s forgiveness.\nBut Śrīla Prabhupāda reasoned that “Dying onparikramais glorious,” and he asked them to take him. A controversy developed among the devotees, as some said Prabhupāda’s will to go onparikramashould be immediately honored as an order from the spiritual master; he wanted it, and he should not be denied. The doctor, however, assured them that Śrīla Prabhupāda’s body would not survive the jostling of the cart. The many devotees who crowded around Śrīla Prabhupāda’s bed held different opinions, and Prabhupāda could see this. Following his request, however, Lokanātha went out and hired a cart with bullocks and prepared it for the ride. Lokanātha and Haṁsadūta suggested that theparikramacould go to the city of Vṛndāvana or visit the seven main temples of the Gosvāmīs. But then they said that since the next day was Govardhana-pūjā, Prabhupāda could go to Govardhana Hill. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, Bhavānanda, and Bhakti-caru, however, protested adamantly against theparikrama.\n“One-day experiment,” Prabhupāda said. “It is for one day. Rest assured I will not die in one day.” He liked the idea of going to Govardhana. “And we shall make our cooking there,” he said. Lokanātha Swami, he assured them, was experienced. “Make very good picnic,” he said.\nAfter discussing back and forth, the devotees finally decided that early the next morning they would take Śrīla Prabhupāda in a bullock cart to Govardhana. The majority of the devotees then left Śrīla Prabhupāda alone for the night.\nLater that night Śrīla Prabhupāda received a visit from Niṣkiñcana Kṛṣṇadāsa Bābājī, who sat with Prabhupāda, chanting and sometimes speaking in Bengali. Suddenly, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Bhavānanda came to Prabhupāda’s bedside. They were in tears and beside themselves with anxiety.\nPrabhupāda understood. “You request me not to go?” he asked.\n“Well, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “I’ll tell you, I’m getting so upset sitting in the room upstairs. I was walking around. Two of the devotees told me that this road is so bad that if you go on this road you’re going to be jolted back and forth. The road is terrible. I just can’t understand, Śrīla Prabhupāda, why it has to be tomorrow that we have to go. If anybody wants you to travel, I do. But why do we have to go when you’re in this condition? I can’t understand it. Why are we throwing everything out the window that we must go tomorrow? I can’t understand.”\n“All right,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda softly, immediately agreeing to their proposal that he not go.\n“Jaya,Śrīla Prabhupāda!” said Bhakti-caru, who was also present.\n“Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Bhavānanda with great relief.\n“All right. You’re satisfied?”\n“Now I am, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Bhavānanda. “Yes. I was in too much anxiety.”\n“Never mind. I shall not put you in anxiety.”\n“Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “we’re so much attached to you that you practically drive us to madness sometimes. Tonight we were becoming mad.”\n“No, no, I shall not do that,” said Prabhupāda. “Bābājī Mahārāja,” Prabhupāda turned to Niṣkiñcana Kṛṣṇadāsa Bābājī and said, “ – just see how much affection they have for me.”\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, “the way you deal with us simply deepens our attachment every moment.”\n“It is my duty,” said Prabhupāda, and the devotees laughed warmly, understanding. Yes, they could understand – that was his duty. By all his actions and dealings, Prabhupāda’s intention was to capture spirit souls and deliver them to Kṛṣṇa. His method was loving service, but he did not do it for himself. He was delivering them to Kṛṣṇa. That was his duty.\nHis departure was exemplary, because his whole life was exemplary. His departure marked the completion of a lifetime of pure devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. A few days before the end, Śrīla Prabhupāda had said he was instructing as far as he could, and his secretary had added, “You are the inspiration.” “Yes,” Śrīla Prabhupāda had replied, “that I shall do until the last breathing.”\nPrabhupāda’s “last breathing” was glorious, not because of any last-minute mystical demonstration, but because Śrīla Prabhupāda remained in perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Like grandfather Bhīṣmadeva, he remained completely collected and noble and grave, teaching until the end. He was preaching that life comes from life, not from matter, and he was showing that one should preach with every breath he has. The many devotees who crowded the large room bore witness that up to the very end, Prabhupāda remained exactly the same. There was nothing suddenly incongruous with what he had previously shown and taught them. At the time of his departure, therefore, he was teaching how to die, by always depending on Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda’s passing away was peaceful. During the evening of November 14, thekavirājaasked him, “Is there anything you want?” and Prabhupāda replied faintly,kuch icchā nahīṁ:“I have no desire.” His passing away was in the perfect situation: in Vṛndāvana, with devotees. A few months previously, a young girl, the daughter of one of Prabhupāda’s disciples, had passed away in Vṛndāvana, and when Śrīla Prabhupāda had been asked if she went back to Godhead to personally associate with Kṛṣṇa, he had said, “Yes, anyone who leaves his body in Vṛndāvana is liberated.”\nOf course, “Vṛndāvana” also means the state of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As Advaita Ācārya had said of Lord Caitanya, “Wherever You are is Vṛndāvana.” And this was also true of Śrīla Prabhupāda. Had Śrīla Prabhupāda passed away in London, New York, or Moscow, therefore, his destination would have been the same. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in theBhagavad-gītā,“One who is always thinking of Me, surely he attains to Me.” But because Vṛndāvana-dhāma is the quintessential realm of Kṛṣṇa consciousness within the universe, the ideal place for departure from this world, so it was yet another exemplary feature of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s life that he went back to Godhead with Vṛndāvana as his last junction.\nThose Vaiṣṇavas who had taken the vow never to risk leaving Vṛndāvana could see that Śrīla Prabhupāda, after sacrificing everything – including the benefit of residing in Vṛndāvana – to deliver fallen souls in the most godforsaken locations of the world, had returned to the holy land of Vṛndāvana and from there had departed for the original abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa in the spiritual sky. As stated in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,“Anyone who executes service in Vṛndāvana certainly goes back to home, back to Godhead, after giving up his body.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s departure was also perfect because he was chanting and hearing the holy names of God. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present at Śrīla Prabhupāda’s passing just as He was at the celebrated passing away of Bhīṣmadeva, who said, “Despite His being equally kind to everyone, He has graciously come before me while I am ending my life, for I am His unflinching servitor.” As Lord Kṛṣṇa came before Bhīṣmadeva, assuring him and everyone else that Bhīṣma was returning back to Godhead on leaving his body, so the Lord in His incarnation ofnamāvatāra,the Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,was present for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s departure.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s life had been dedicated to spreading the holy name to every town and village, and for a month he had been surrounding himself with the holy name. For his passing away, he especially wanted to fill the room with devotees chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa fulfilled that wish. Śrīla Prabhupāda, therefore, departed under the most favorable circumstances possible – in the most sacred place, Vṛndāvana, surrounded by Vaiṣṇavas chanting the holy name.\nAn ideal spiritual teacher (ācārya) always acts in such a way that others may follow his example. AsŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamstates, these great souls who cross over the ocean of birth and death by taking shelter of the “boat” of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa miraculously leave the boat on this side for others to use. And Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disappearance, by its perfect example, affords all conditioned souls the means for meeting the greatest of all dangers. An auspicious death is not merely a matter of psychological adjustment, so that one may die without regret or without becoming unduly upset. The real point is that at the time of death the soul must leave the body and take his next birth. Only the Kṛṣṇa conscious soul can leave this world of birth and death and attain an eternal, blissful life in the spiritual world. Therefore one’s life is tested at death.\nDeath means the soul cannot stand to live in the body anymore. Whatever the material cause may be, the situation has become unbearable for the soul. And leaving the body causes great distress. Theśāstras,therefore, advise us to get free from the cycle of repeated birth and death. Meeting an inauspicious death and being dragged down to a lower birth is the most fearful thing for the living being. So fearful is it that we may try to ignore death altogether. Death is painful because the eternal spirit soul is placed in a most unnatural situation: although he is eternal and should not have to die, he is forced to die because of his connection with the material body. At death, the eternal soul is forced to leave the body for a destination he knows not. Thus he is full of fear and suffering. The pain and fear are usually overwhelming, and one thinks only of material attachments or bodily pain. Therefore King Kulaśekhara prayed, and Prabhupāda often quoted, “Please let me pass away, not in some prolonged contemplation of my bodily death, but just while I’m chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. If I can meditate on You and then pass from this body, that will be perfection.”\nOver the last months of his life in this world, Śrīla Prabhupāda taught how it is possible to meet death step by step in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In his last days, he told one of hissannyāsīs,“Don’t think this isn’t going to happen to you.” Prabhupāda came into this world, on Kṛṣṇa’s request, to teach us how to live a pure life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that includes how to finally pass away from this world to attain eternal life. Prabhupāda underwent death in a way that was perfect and glorious, and at the same time in a way which we can all follow. When we have to go, we can cling to the memory of how a great soul left his body – always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, surrounding himself with the medicine of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, always desiring to hear about Kṛṣṇa, and practicing detachment from the misery of the material condition. This last lesson was one of the most wonderful and important instructions Śrīla Prabhupāda gave us. He taught by his life, by his books, and at the end by his dying. Education in how to die is meant especially for the human being. An animal dies, and a human being also dies; but a human being is supposed to understand the process of going back to the spiritual world at the time of death. Remaining always fixed and undisturbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Śrīla Prabhupāda expertly taught the process. His passing away, therefore, was a perfect lesson, and one that can be faithfully followed.\nWhile there was nothing lamentable for Śrīla Prabhupāda in his departing from the world and going back to Godhead, it was certainly lamentable for his followers and for the people of the whole world, who became bereft of the presence of their greatest well-wisher and benefactor. Śrīla Prabhupāda had written in aŚrīmad-Bhāgavatampurport, “When the mortal body of the spiritual master expires, the disciple should cry exactly like the queen cries when the king leaves his body.” At the departure of his own spiritual master, Śrīla Prabhupāda had written, “On that day, O my Master, I made a cry of grief; I was not able to tolerate the absence of you, myguru.” And so on November 14, 1977, as the powerful news spread around the world, those who knew and loved Śrīla Prabhupāda were gripped by a fearful, unrestricted grief. They saw everything around them in the overwhelming atmosphere of separation from Śrīla Prabhupāda. They turned for solace to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s disciples were already carrying out his instructions, but now they would have to do so without thevapuḥ,without the opportunity of regularly seeing and being with him. At first this was very difficult for them to face, but those who were sincere soon realized that Śrīla Prabhupāda had, upon his departure, given them the greatest gift of all: service in separation.\nService in separation is the highest realization and ecstasy. This was the teaching of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in regard to Lord Kṛṣṇa and His foremost devotees, thegopīsof Vṛndāvana. When Kṛṣṇa left His belovedgopīsand went to Mathurā, never to return to them in Vṛndāvana, thegopīs(and all the other residents of Vṛndāvana) wept piteously in separation. They so much loved Kṛṣṇa that they could not live without Him, and to maintain their lives they began to constantly remember and discuss His name, fame, form, and entourage. By constantly remembering Him in love and by anticipating His return to Vṛndāvana, they achieved an ecstasy ofunion in separation,which Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava scholars declare to be superior even to the ecstasy thegopīsfelt in Kṛṣṇa’s presence. Because Kṛṣṇa is absolute, even remembering Him or chanting His name puts the devotee into direct contact with Him. But because there is simultaneously a feeling of separation from Him, there is an added dimension of inconceivable, simultaneous union and separation. This is the epitome of Kṛṣṇa conscious realization.\nPrabhupāda’s followers knew this principle of service in separation, technically known asvipralambha-sevā,but to most devotees it was a theoretical realization. Before one can feel intense loving separation from Kṛṣṇa, one must first feel intense attraction to Him. But for the conditioned soul who has forgotten and abandoned Kṛṣṇa and has come to the material world under the spell ofmāyā,illusion – for him, “separation” from Kṛṣṇa is based on complete ignorance and forgetfulness.\nIn coming to spiritual life, a neophyte first begins to awaken to the very existence of God, as he overcomes atheistic misconceptions. Next, he comes gradually, through practice, to take up a relationship of service to Kṛṣṇa, through serving the spiritual master. Intense love of Kṛṣṇa in separation is the most advanced stage and cannot possibly be realized in full by the neophyte. Thus service in separation had remained a theoretical teaching to many of Prabhupāda’s followers.\nBut when Śrīla Prabhupāda departed from the world and left his disciples to carry on his mission, they immediately realized union with him in separation. He was gone, but he was still very much present. This realization was not a pretention or a myth, nor was it sentimental psychic phenomena – telepathy, “communion with the dead,” or so on. It was a completely substantive, practical, palpable reality, a fact of life. Śrīla Prabhupāda had given them personal service, and now they would continue that service. Prabhupāda was still present through his instructions, and all the nectar of his direct association – all the nectar of Kṛṣṇa consciousness that he had given and shared with them – was still available.\nService in separation for Prabhupāda’s disciples was undoubtedly a fact, otherwise, now that they were without his personal presence, how were they able to sustain themselves in spiritual life? The fact that they could continue as before, increase their feelings of devotion, and even increase their serving capacity, meant that Śrīla Prabhupāda was very much still with them. As Śrīla Prabhupāda’s last instruction was the lesson of how a human being should die, he now taught, beyond dying, how to practically implement the highest philosophical teachings of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism.\nThis realization gave the devotees great hope that Śrīla Prabhupāda and the revolutionary life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness he had brought with him were not finished upon his departure. Often when a great personality dies, his contribution collapses; but Śrīla Prabhupāda’s presence remained and expanded, sustaining his devotees’ lives. He was still in charge.\nIn describing how the followers of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda continue to relish the nectar of serving him in separation, we are not speaking of only a small band of several thousand devotees whom he initiated during his lifetime. Śrīla Prabhupāda was not only anācārya,but he was the founder-ācāryaof the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, which is a dynamic spiritual reality. That reality is nothing less than theyuga-dharma,or the form of spiritual life recommended for all humanity in the present Age of Kali, the most dangerous of ages, in which humanity eventually abandons all religious principles.\nThe ultimate goal of human life was taught by Lord Kṛṣṇa in theBhagavad-gītā,when He declared, “Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” Kṛṣṇa taught this five thousand years ago, when He appeared in the world, but people have misinterpreted and misunderstood what Kṛṣṇa meant. Lord Caitanya advented, therefore, to revive the original message of surrender to Kṛṣṇa, primarily by introducing thesaṅkīrtanamovement of chanting the holy names of God.\nBhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya appearing in the nineteenth century, foresaw that Lord Caitanya’ssaṅkīrtanaprinciples could and would be introduced all over the world. He had studied deeply many other religions and philosophies, but he felt that Lord Caitanya’ssaṅkīrtanawas universal, the essence of religious life able to unite all people and bring them to perfection. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s son was Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, who became the spiritual master of Śrīla Prabhupāda and who ordered Śrīla Prabhupāda to implement the vision of worldwide Kṛṣṇa consciousness by going to preach in the West.\nA. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda is, therefore, to be appreciated not only as theguruof a few intimate servants or even theguruof a single generation of disciples. As the founder-ācāryaof the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, he introduced the standard of Kṛṣṇa consciousness as it can be practiced by all sincere followers for thousands of years to come.\nThe scriptures predict that although the present age is constantly becoming more inauspicious, unfortunate, and degraded, for a period of ten thousand years from the time of Lord Caitanya’s advent a golden age of Kṛṣṇa consciousness can appear, despite the force of Kali-yuga. Śrīla Prabhupāda, therefore, prepared his translations and Bhaktivedanta purports on the essential Vaiṣṇava scriptures–Bhagavad-gītā,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,Caitanya-caritāmṛta,andBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu –with the plan that they would form the foundation of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement for ten thousand years.\nWe cannot limit Śrīla Prabhupāda, therefore, by describing him only within the drama of his being thegurufor one generation of followers. Śrīla Prabhupāda isjagad-guru,the spiritual master of the entire world. He is a bona fide spiritual master, faithfully conveying the message of the disciplic succession from Lord Kṛṣṇa, as he received it inparamparāfrom his spiritual master. But more than that, he was empowered by Kṛṣṇa to do what no other spiritual master has ever done. He is the founder-ācāryafor spreading Lord Caitanya’ssaṅkīrtanaworldwide in the midst of the Age of Kali.\nAnyone who wants shelter from the evil effects of the present godless age can have it by taking up devotional service under the guidance of Lord Caitanya’s teachings as given by Prabhupāda. The dynamic preaching and realizations of Śrīla Prabhupāda reveal the sublime teachings of Lord Caitanya, which otherwise have been neglected, misused, and kept within the confines of India. Śrīla Prabhupāda was actually able to understand Lord Caitanya’s prediction that Kṛṣṇa consciousness would spread to every town and village in the world.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had faith in these words and personally saw in his lifetime that pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness could be adopted by people of all races and cultures, even those considered by Vedic standards to be aborigines and outcasts. Through the applications of Śrīla Prabhupāda, therefore, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is now proven to be viable for anyone, anywhere in the world.\nAnyone can serve Śrīla Prabhupāda in separation. He asked all his followers to avoid four sinful activities – meat-eating, intoxication, illicit sex, and gambling – and to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇamantraa minimum of sixteen rounds daily on beads. He also advised that one regularly read Vedic literatures such asBhagavad-gītāAs It IsandŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.And for keeping spiritual health and strength to follow the spiritual principles, he advised that one associate with like-minded devotees. Whoever follows these basic practices and recognizes Śrīla Prabhupāda as the direct representative of Kṛṣṇa is his follower. And the Vedic scriptures say that only by serving the representative of Kṛṣṇa can one become dear to Kṛṣṇa Himself.\nThe ways of serving Kṛṣṇa are unlimited, as Śrīla Prabhupāda expertly displayed. He invited scientists, artists, philosophers, and businessmen to serve Kṛṣṇa according to their occupations and capabilities. The artist, instead of painting pictures out of his imagination or making renderings of the material energy, can paint pictures depicting Kṛṣṇa in the spiritual world. The poet can describe Kṛṣṇa as the Absolute Truth; the philosopher can explain Kṛṣṇa as the cause of all causes; the scientist can prove that life comes from life; and the businessman can contribute money to the worthiest welfare activity of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A person does not, therefore, have to abandon his family or retreat to a solitary cave to realize God. In any situation of life one can move from mundane to spiritual by adopting the practices of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the broad and liberal way Śrīla Prabhupāda intended Kṛṣṇa consciousness to pervade society.\nThe International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Prabhupāda’s own society of devotees, is meant to help all persons interested in developing spiritual life under Śrīla Prabhupāda’s guidance. ISKCON was Prabhupāda’s organization for establishing and proliferating temple worship, book printing and distribution, and communities where devotees could live and serve together in close association. Prabhupāda therefore entrusted all his properties, including the magnificent temples he had built in India, to ISKCON, for the protection and perpetuation of his work. And he instructed his disciples to show their love for him by always cooperating among themselves to expand further the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nWhen a disciple expressed his appreciation of Prabhupāda’s magnificent quarters in Bombay, Prabhupāda replied, “I cannot take these with me. I am leaving them for you to use.”\nThe essential gifts of Kṛṣṇa consciousness which Prabhupāda brought are for everyone. Although most people do not know it, they are actually hankering for the happiness of genuine spiritual life. Prabhupāda, out of compassion, wanted to distribute the gifts of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the hungry people in the world. These gifts – peace of mind, satisfaction, freedom from anxiety – can be obtained by anyone who takes wholeheartedly to devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This pure, happy state can be realized by receiving the ongoing, dynamic legacy which Prabhupāda left: his books, his devotees, his Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, and his method of expertly applying Kṛṣṇa consciousness to every situation in the modern context. Whoever intelligently takes up the practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness will also inherit the most wonderful realization in his relationship with Śrīla Prabhupāda, the pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa.\nWe hope that theŚrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛtawill help the readers in establishing their relationship with Śrīla Prabhupāda. Its contribution is in the mood of remembering Śrīla Prabhupāda in separation. Remembering his pastimes puts one into direct contact with him and with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and this remembrance can free one from bondage to material life and enable one to taste the nectar of the eternal pastimes of Kṛṣṇa and His associates in the spiritual world.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s life did not end on November 14, 1977. And we hope that the readers ofŚrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛtawill not feel they have finished their connection with this literature by having read it once.Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛtacan be read regularly, from beginning to end. Our hope is that by hearing about Śrīla Prabhupāda the reader will become himself a Prabhupādānuga, a follower of Śrīla Prabhupāda. We can wish no better fortune upon anyone."

        "chapter_title": "Return to America",
        "content": "San FranciscoDecember 14, 1967\nAS SOON AS Śrīla Prabhupāda came into view, many devotees began to cry out or shed tears. He looked much healthier, tanned from the sun, spritely. He waved and smiled. That smile made them still more eager, and they could hardly contain themselves while Prabhupāda patiently waited for a customs official to inspect his bags.\nWhen Prabhupāda had left America, his disciples had been uncertain whether they would ever see him again. He had suffered a paralyzing stroke in New York and had gone back to India to recuperate. If he were going to die, he had said, the best place in the world was Vṛndāvana. But soon in his letters from India came news of his returning strength. Kṛṣṇa had saved him. Now he was back. They needed him; if they were to represent him and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then they needed more association with Kṛṣṇa’s pure devotee.\nJayānanda drove him from the airport in an old limousine decorated with flowers. Prabhupāda would be staying in an apartment in thebrahmacārīs’house on Willard Street, about two blocks from the storefront temple on Frederick Street. As he approached the door of his apartment, he saw the picture of Lord Viṣṇu, taped to the inside of the glass, facing him. Although the devotees had debated about the picture because Lord Viṣṇu had not been colored blue, Prabhupāda joined his palms together in thepraṇāmagesture and, slightly bowing his head, passed Lord Viṣṇu and entered the house.\nThe devotees gathered excitedly in Prabhupāda’s room. One of them had read about a Vaiṣṇava ceremony of washing the feet of the spiritual master, so they had prepared a pitcher of water and a bowl. Prabhupāda permitted it, and in a few seconds it was done. Then he sat facing a crowded room of intimate devotees. Taking hiskaratālasand playing them softly and sweetly, he led a Hare Kṛṣṇakīrtana.It was no ordinary thing how Prabhupāda sang and how they listened and chanted in response with fastened, ecstatic attention. But it was brief.\nAfterwards, he began to speak of Kṛṣṇa. He said that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and everyone’s best friend. Even a good friendship in this world is a small indication of Kṛṣṇa’s friendship, because everything is coming from Kṛṣṇa. If you feel good on a nice spring day, that is an indication of Kṛṣṇa. The smell of an aromatic flower – that is Kṛṣṇa. Whatever is good in this world is Kṛṣṇa, and all that is bad comes from forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda spoke with a kind, gentle, and humble attitude.\nHe had brought back some gifts. For the ladies he hadsārīs.He held up the thin cotton cloths one at a time, called the name of each initiated girl disciple, and handed her asārī.Onesārīwas white with a red and black design, others were white with single-color borders. In a small saffron cloth Prabhupāda had three silken garlands. He unwrapped them, saying, “These can be tied around the necks of Lord Jagannātha, Subhadrā, and Balarāma.” Previous to this, the deities had received no dresses or decorations.\nMukunda and Śyāmasundara came forward to show Prabhupāda their first American-madekaratālas.Months ago Prabhupāda had suggested that they might makekaratālasin America, and the men had analyzed the metals in the Indiankaratālas,gathered the ingredients from scrapyards, taken them to a foundry, and had them molded into a finished product. Prabhupāda took the first pair of Americankaratālasin his hand, hit them together a few times, and pronounced, “Not so great.” Again he took up his own beautifully polished brasskaratālasfrom India. Striking them together once, he let them ring for a long time. “Thisis great,” he said.\nThen, looking around the room, Prabhupāda engaged in friendly little exchanges with his disciples. Seeing Līlāvatī sitting in a corner with her baby daughter, Subhadrā, Prabhupāda said, “Your daughter looks just like Subhadrā.” Līlāvatī sighed gratefully to hear it. “Govinda dāsī,” Prabhupāda said, “I am always thinking of your paintings.”\nPrabhupāda asked whether all the devotees were chanting their prescribed sixteen rounds daily. Almost everyone replied, “Yes, Swamiji.” One new devotee, however, an English girl whose face turned bright red, began to stammer in a faltering voice. “I chant …,” she said, “I chant …” and then suddenly blurting out like a little girl about to cry, “Sometimes I chantmorethan sixteen rounds a day!” Her voice cracked, and she seemed on the brink of tears, but the devotees and Prabhupāda could not help from laughing. In Prabhupāda’s presence it all seemed jovial. Uddhava dāsa came into the room and announced, “We have someprasādamfor you, Swamiji. Would you like to take now?”\n“What?” asked Prabhupāda. “A little rice?” The devotees began to laugh, thinking of the elaborate feast they had prepared for Prabhupāda.\nPrabhupāda had one more thing to show them in his bag. It was a coconut grater commonly used in Bengali households. Prabhupāda gave it to Yamunā, who began to grate a coconut while the devotees watched. Surrounded by his devotees, Prabhupāda then went to the kitchen and prepared coconutlaḍḍusmade from the white coconut pulp, butter, sugar, black pepper, cardamom, and camphor flavor. He rolled them into balls, ate one himself, and distributed a few.\nPrabhupāda returned to his room, where he sat down again and was silent. Sensing that he should be left alone, the devotees excused themselves from his presence. Everyone was satisfied. Prabhupāda was back, and they would have him for a while.\nJīvānanda:After everybody left, I stayed behind to talk to him, and seeing me just kind of sitting there, he put me to work and made me clean up his room. I began to pick up the paper and stuff and throw away all the boxes. So afterwards Prabhupāda said, “So you have some question?” And I said, “Yes, Swamiji. I would like to get married to Harṣarāṇī.” He said, “Oh. Who are you?” I said, “I am Jīvānanda.” He said, “Oh, you have been initiated?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “By me?” and I said, “Yes.” He said, “That’s very nice. What do you do?” I said, “Well, when I was in Santa Fe, I used to milk the cows.” He said, “That is very nice.” We talked some more, and then I said, “Swamiji, can I get married?” He said, “I will think about it. You can ask me again later.”\nCidānanda:That evening I went to his room to see him, as I felt he might be lonely. I went into his room to try to keep him company, but as soon as I got there he started talking about Kṛṣṇa. There were some Brijabasi posters of Kṛṣṇa on the wall, and he would point to them and explain a little, saying, “Here is Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra.” He talked, and I didn’t have a chance to say anything, but he just talked about the posters on the wall. I got the feeling that we had known each other from some other time, although this was the first time I was seeing him. Yet he seemed like an old friend. He was certainly magnanimous and cordial as he sat there and talked about Kṛṣṇa. I felt that if hewasan old friend, then maybe I would know this to be a fact some day. But my attention span was not very long, and I really didn’t know very much about the life of Kṛṣṇa, so I left after a short period of time.\nBut everyone got a chance to accompany Swamiji on his morning walks. They were open to whoever wanted to go. Usually one or two of thebrahmacārīsand one or two householder couples would accompany him. They would drive Prabhupāda to the park in the temple’s car, a 1952 blue Ford coupé. Usually Jayānanda would drive the car. The passenger seat was broken and tilted back at a forty-five-degree angle to the ground, and although Prabhupāda sat up straight, his chin held high, the seat slanted so much that he could only see out of the lowest part of the window. But it was the only car they had, and Prabhupāda never complained.\nHe began his old routine of daily walking around Stowe Lake in Golden Gate Park. Healthy, free, and spontaneous, always in command, talking and preaching, Prabhupāda seemed very happy to be back in San Francisco. And there were also new devotees who were seeing him for the first time.\nFor about the first week on his morning walks, Prabhupāda talked frequently about the existence of the soul, explaining Kṛṣṇa’s arguments in theBhagavad-gītā.\nOne morning a car was parked near where they walked, and seated in the driver’s seat was a dejected-looking man who sat slumped over, with a long, drawn, unhappy face. Day after day this car appeared there, and the man sat unhappily while the devotees walked past in the company of Śrīla Prabhupāda. Finally, after about a week, Prabhupāda one day broke away from the group of devotees and approached the man’s car. The car window was rolled up, but on seeing Prabhupāda, the man rolled down the window. Prabhupāda greeted him, “Good morning.” The man smiled, happy to see Prabhupāda, as if he had never noticed Prabhupāda and the devotees walking by day after day. Prabhupāda then rejoined his disciples and continued walking. They looked back and saw that the deep unhappiness in the man’s face had vanished and he appeared happier. They did not see him anymore on the morning walks. Among themselves the devotees discussed these things or kept the impressions privately in their hearts. After a little incident like that of the man sitting slumped in his car, they were even more convinced that Swamiji had the power and ability to make people happy, and that he really wanted to do it.\nOne morning Prabhupāda arrived in the park, stepped out of his car, and waited for the devotees who had come in another car to join him. Līlāvatī had difficulty getting out of the car because she had her baby, Subhadrā, in a carrier on her back. When she finally did get out of the car, Prabhupāda turned and laughed at her, saying, “Ah, burden of affection.” “Yes, Swamiji,” Līlāvatī replied. They all began to walk together along the path.\n“So there are two ways to carry a baby,” Prabhupāda said, tapping his cane on the ground in time with his regular stride. “There is the monkey way and the cat way. Do you know this?”\n“No, Swamiji,” said Līlāvatī.\n“Well, which way do you think is better?” Prabhupāda asked her. “The monkey way or the cat way?” She couldn’t understand or imagine what he meant. Prabhupāda continued, “The monkey baby climbs on the back of the mother and holds on, and this is the way he travels. And the kitten is carried in the teeth of the mother. So which is better?”\nLīlāvatī could still not understand which way could be better; they both sounded very difficult to her.\n“Well,” Prabhupāda said, “the monkey baby is very small and very weak, and he is holding on to the mother by his own strength. But the kitten is being supported by the strength of the mother. So which way do you think is better?”\nAnd then she understood. “The cat way is better.”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said, “that is the difference between theyogīand the devotee. Theyogīis trying to climb on the back of the Absolute Truth by his own strength, but he is very weak, so he will fall. But a devotee, he cries out for Kṛṣṇa” – and as he spoke the wordKṛṣṇa,Prabhupāda held his arms up high and looked up at the clear morning sky – “A devotee cries out for Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa picks him up.”\nAnother time a devotee picked a pretty bluish-colored flower and handed it to Prabhupāda. Prabhupāda took it, smelled it, then held it far away and looked at it, saying, “Oh, this is like a beautiful man without any qualifications.” He then tossed it away. It had no aroma.\nUpendra liked to ask Swamiji questions on the morning walks.\n“Swamiji,” Upendra asked, “what does the spiritual master or pure devotee see as he walks through the park?”\n“He sees Kṛṣṇa,” Prabhupāda replied. “He thinks that these are Kṛṣṇa’s trees, and this is Kṛṣṇa’s house. He sees everything as belonging to the Supreme Lord.”\n“But if Kṛṣṇa is everywhere,” Upendra pursued, “does the pure devotee see Kṛṣṇa on the wall on the right and then the wall on the left or in the corner or in between every atom? Does he see one form of Kṛṣṇa merge into another? Where does one form of Kṛṣṇa begin and take off from the other form?”\n“No, it is not like that,” Prabhupāda said. “Do you see my spectacles?”\n“Yes,” said Upendra.\n“So whose spectacles are they?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“They are yours.”\nPrabhupāda pointed to his shoes. “And what is that?”\n“Those are your shoes,” said Upendra.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said. “Similarly, a pure devotee sees Kṛṣṇa like that. Everything is Kṛṣṇa’s. This is how he sees Kṛṣṇa everywhere.” Near the end of the walk, when Prabhupāda had answered many questions, Upendra asked again, “Swamiji, you’ve spoken to us so much, but I forget most of it. If a devotee becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, will he remember everything the spiritual master says?”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied. “It is all there. Not only that, but when a person becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he will be able to see his relationship with Kṛṣṇa.”\nWalking through Golden Gate Park one day, they heard a scratching coming from a garbage can. Prabhupāda went over and looked in, then pulled back in repulsion. A big city rat had somehow become trapped in the garbage can and was scratching, trying to get out. Prabhupāda shook his head and said, “He is doomed.” He walked on. Prabhupāda commented that later the garbagemen would come, see the rat, and kill him. Prabhupāda was always after the philosophical and Kṛṣṇa conscious meaning; even a seemingly ordinary comment about the rat’s doom struck his disciples as deep and philosophical. They could understand that their position was similar: they were trapped in the material world, waiting for the end, but Prabhupāda was saving them.\nOn his return from India, after taking part in the first eveningkīrtanain the San Francisco temple, Prabhupāda said, “You have all advanced.” He saw that the devotees had become more enthusiastic and ecstatic  – guests were also rising and dancing – and that pleased his own Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nEach night afterkīrtanahe would lecture. He was discussing the verses in the sixth chapter ofBhagavad-gītā.“I am making here a series of lectures on the Kṛṣṇa consciousyogasystem,” Prabhupāda wrote to Brahmānanda in mid-December of 1967, “and they are tape recorded.”\nPrabhupāda thought of assembling the lectures into a small book. Indiangurusintroducing self-styled techniques were increasingly popular in the U.S. Therefore Prabhupāda wanted to distinguish the standard form ofyogaand meditation, as taught by Lord Kṛṣṇa in theBhagavad-gītā,from the farce taught byguruswho never mention Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead but rather say everyone is equal to God, and whose disciples are allowed to indulge their senses in intoxication and illicit sex. They give amantrafor a fee, Prabhupāda noted, and claim that by meditating twenty minutes in the morning you can become God in six months. He was surprised that American people, who were supposedly intelligent, were being so easily cheated. “We have actually seen such so-calledyogīs,” Prabhupāda said, “sleeping and snoring while meditating.”\n“Service begins by the tongue,” Prabhupāda said in one of his December ’67 lectures, “by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa, and by the taste ofkṛṣṇa-prasādam.The beginning process is very nice. Ifprasādamis offered to you, accept it. If you become submissive and give service, by these two practices, Kṛṣṇa will reveal Himself to you – just like Kṛṣṇa is revealing Himself to Arjuna. Arjuna is a devotee, he is a friend: ‘I am speaking to you that old system ofyoga,bhakti-yoga.’ Only one who has developed the service spirit with love and devotion, he can understand Kṛṣṇa.”\nAfter the lecture Prabhupāda would continue the theme, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in his room. It was the same theme as on his morning walks, in his letters, or in his intimate talks with individual disciples or visitors; it was the theme of his writing, and the very heartbeat of his life. When a devotee asked Prabhupāda how the soul is carried from body to body, Prabhupāda replied, “By desire,” and cited himself as an example. “Just like I have come to America. Why? Because I wanted to preach. So by that desire I was carried here. Otherwise, I have no business to come here.”\nCidānanda:There would be three, four, or five devotees in his room, and he would just start talking. They would somehow gather in his room, and he would start talking about what he was trying to do. His talk was not directed specifically to anyone, but he was saying that this is what he was doing. He made everything very clear. He wanted to publish his books. He was trying to get a press for this back in New York. And if he had a letter from Rāya Rāma in New York, he would read the letter right there. In this way it was allaying any doubts in people’s minds about what he was really going to try to do. He had his books and the temple. He was concerned about the temple and the new lunch program, where we were giving out freeprasādam.His concern kept everybody going. Before he came, there wasn’t that much activity. But when Prabhupāda came, things started bustling very fast.\nOne night in his room on Willard Street, Prabhupāda was talking about seeing Kṛṣṇa. “Don’t try to see Him,” Prabhupāda said, “but act in such a way that He will come and see you … Sūradāsa was a blind man, yet due to his sincere chanting – ‘O Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa’ – Kṛṣṇa came to see him. So Kṛṣṇa is there whether we see Him or not. All we must do is become sincere, and He will present Himself whether we see Him or not. Kṛṣṇa hugs the cow. What does a cow know? He is a dumb animal. Is the cow as great as Arjuna? No. Yet due to the cow’s sincerity to come and lick Kṛṣṇa’s body, Kṛṣṇa says, ‘Oh, yes, My dear cow, come, and I shall take care of you.’ And Kṛṣṇa gives him some sweet nectar. So we should want Kṛṣṇa to come and see us, not that you should want to see Kṛṣṇa.”\nAt that time, few devotees were very well read in Prabhupāda’s books. They didn’t know the vastness of the philosophy. Only a few books were published, and so Prabhupāda in person was the real source of Kṛṣṇa conscious knowledge.\nEighteen-year-old Kim used to have philosophical arguments with his atheistic father and then invariably have questions for Prabhupāda at the end of the lectures. He would ask so consistently that Prabhupāda would turn to him and say, “Are there any questions?” Given a good question, Prabhupāda might launch into another impromptu lecture.\nKim’s sister, who was only sixteen, also wanted to get initiated. “Are there offenses in the spiritual world?” she asked Prabhupāda at one evening lecture. Prabhupāda turned to the audience. “See?” he said. “This little girl, she wants to go back to Godhead.” And in the course of the answer, he said, “Kṛṣṇa may kiss you.” When he said that, Kim’s sister blushed, and everyone laughed.\nUpendra asked, “Swamiji, how should we feel humble? I feel sometimes that when I try to be humble I first think about it, and then I try to be humble. But it seems artificial.”\n“Thisis humbleness,” Prabhupāda said. “When we think, ‘Oh, I should have done it this way’ – that is good. Because then there is always room for improvement. If you go on thinking, ‘Oh, I did not perform this duty so nicely. I should have done it this way,’ then you will improve. Our love for Kṛṣṇa keeps growing as long as we think that we are not doing the most for Kṛṣṇa and that we must do more. This is humbleness. If you think, ‘Oh, I did this so wonderfully. I am such a nice and sincere devotee,’ then this is not good. There will be no improvement.”\nIf, in questioning, anyone brought up the names and philosophies of famous contemporary Māyāvādīs, Prabhupāda would become angry. He was adamantly against the mission of the Māyāvādīs, who deny the absolute reality of Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda expressed that they had greatly damaged the original Vedic culture by spreading misleading doctrines. One time Mālatī brought up the subject of certain Māyāvādī teachings, and Prabhupāda, as usual, argued strongly. Afterwards Upendra chastised Mālatī, saying that she shouldn’t have brought it up because Prabhupāda was still recuperating in his health. In his excitement his blood pressure might rise too much. Mālatī was silent, but later gave Upendra a letter to be delivered to Prabhupāda. “What have you said to Mālatī,” Prabhupāda asked after reading her letter, “that now she no longer feels she can come before me?” Upendra explained how he had corrected her for inciting Prabhupāda too much. It was nonsense, Prabhupāda said, and he told Upendra to apologize to her.\nUddhava confided to Kim that he felt left out because he never had any questions to ask Prabhupāda. Kim encouraged him. One night Uddhava finally asked, but it was a strange question. “Swamiji,” said Uddhava, “what is Rādhārāṇī’s relationship with Kṛṣṇa’s brother, Balarāma?”\nPrabhupāda was annoyed: “Why are you asking that? You don’t even understand the basic principle of theBhagavad-gītā.You don’t understand the nature of the soul and the Supersoul or Kṛṣṇa and devotional service, and yet you are asking questions like this?” For a long while Uddhava didn’t ask again.\n“Are you following the four rules?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“Yes,” she replied. And then he said it was all right.\n“I just wanted to say something else,” she continued, “that is, I heard that you had taken birth because in your last life you had been a physician and had killed a snake for some medical purpose.”\nPrabhupāda laughed. “Oh, your brother has told you that?”\n“Yeah,” she replied. No more was said about it. Kim was given the name Kṛṣṇadāsa, and Prabhupāda also initiated a few disciples who had written from New York. He performed the initiation ceremony in the temple and chanted on everyone’s beads, including the New York disciples’. That night he also spoke for a few moments on the telephone with Brahmānanda in New York and told him, “I have returned by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, and I am now fit to serve you.”\nPrabhupāda said he was fit to serve the devotees, and he certainly looked and acted wonderfully. But he was still feeling the effects of his stroke of half a year ago. There was a persistent ringing sound, like a bell, in his head, and he couldn’t sleep more than three hours at night and one in the day. But he pushed on as always. He even wrote a letter to a disciple pointing out that although he had disturbance in his head, he was continuing to work on the transcendental plane; and he advised his disciples to do likewise.\nPrabhupāda again took up his translating of the Third Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,which he had put aside for half a year. Living in the same house with thebrahmacārīs,he would wake before any of them and work at his translating. Then after they rose around five, they would hear him ringing a bell in his room, and they would smell incense. Because of their proximity, the boys would often drop by his room. They would watch Prabhupāda sitting at his desk, fresh from his morning shower. He would meticulously place several tiny spoonfuls of water in his left palm and then rub a ball of Vṛndāvana clay into his palm, making the mixture for Vaiṣṇavatilaka.Using a hand mirror, he would artistically make the markings oftilaka –first on his forehead and then on eleven other parts of the body – as directed by the Vaiṣṇavasmṛti.Prabhupāda would then hold hisbrāhmaṇathread and silently say the Gāyatrīmantras,while facing the pictures of Kṛṣṇa he had on a little altar.\nOne day, while sitting with Prabhupāda in the morning, Upendra mentioned that thebrahmacārīsput theirtilakaon while in the bathroom.\n“No,” said Prabhupāda,“tilakashould be put on in front of Kṛṣṇa, like this.”\n“Well,” Upendra said, “here I’ve seen them putting it on in the bathroom.”\n“Do not worry too much about the rules and regulations. Just get everyone to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nOne thing Prabhupāda liked about California was that it was easy for him to obtain eucalyptus twigs there. Prabhupāda used them for brushing his teeth in the morning. He liked them cut the thickness of the little finger and about six inches long, and they were soaked in water overnight before he used them. At this time Kṛṣṇadāsa was going out in the morning to pick them. He would keep a good supply wrapped up in tin foil in the refrigerator. Hearing that eucalyptus trees were uncommon in America, Prabhupāda had asked Kṛṣṇadāsa to send him a supply wherever he traveled.\nThese sometimes small and domestic dealings of Prabhupāda with his disciples may be seen by someone outside of devotional service as of little consequence, but to the devotee they are always important, because the devotee holds the pleasure of his spiritual master as the supreme value in life. If the spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa’s representative, is pleased by even a little service, then that means that Kṛṣṇa is pleased. For the most part, Prabhupāda’s disciples simply knew that they loved him, loved serving him, and felt great satisfaction and bliss when he showed his pleasure with them.\nGovinda dāsī:He needed some house slippers. I saw that. So I went and bought him some house slippers. He told me he wore size eight. I got him some all–man-made slippers in San Francisco. They were black with red fluffy, furry lining, so that they were easy to slip on the feet. Whenever he would walk around the house you could hear this nice little shuffling sound. He would have his hands behind his back and his head held high.\nAlthough some of the devotees had their own idea that Prabhupāda should go on a special diet, he didn’t think much of it. He wanted his regularprasādam – dāl,rice,capātīs,andsabjī.Upendra was regularly cooking these staples. But one day Yamunā came into the kitchen and asked Upendra if she could cook a special lunch for Prabhupāda. He stepped back and allowed her. Yamunā was learning the art of Indian cooking. She made extra preparations, sour, spicy, and sweet. Upendra brought in the tray as usual, without any comment. A few moments later Prabhupāda rang his bell, calling for Upendra.\n“Who has made thisprasādam?” Prabhupāda asked, looking up as he sat on a cushion before a small table which held his lunch.\n“Yamunā-devī cooked it, Swamiji,” said Upendra.\n“I do not want such fancy things,” said Prabhupāda. “I want to eat simply. A little rice, a littledāl,like that.” He wasn’t very pleased with the special feast; he was used to eating the same simple thing every day. Upendra continued to cook like that, occasionally creating variety by cookingkicharīand fried eggplant inkaḍīsauce once a week. But Upendra was also extravagant. Prabhupāda confided to Gaurasundara, “That Upendra is using too much ghee, so that I cannot taste theprasādambefore it slips down my throat. It is too slippery.”\nOne of the devotees who had been with Prabhupāda in India wrote that Swamiji should not be given sweets. Prabhupāda didn’t think much of that either, as he had introduced coconutlaḍḍuson the first evening of his return.\nUpendra:He gave us the recipe that you grate the coconut and cook it in a pot, along with some sugar and camphor, and cook it and cook it until it comes to a certain thickness, and then it can be squeezed into balls and offered in this way. So he was giving this instruction to me, and I was following. The stove was an old-fashioned type that allowed for one half of the stove to be covered with a safety cover. While I cooked, Prabhupāda leaned against the corner of the stove with his elbows, his chin resting in his hands, and he leaned and watched me stir. He got up and walked away and then came back, just like a restless young boy. He walked around the kitchen and then returned to look into the pot, stirring it to see if it was done. He asked, “Is it done? I think it’s done. It must be done. Let us try.” I took the substance out, and although it was still hot, we began squeezing it into balls. As soon as one ball was squeezed, Prabhupāda took it and popped it into his mouth. He turned away from the stove and, shaking his head pleasingly, said, “Yes, it is done. Very nice.”\nPrabhupāda spontaneously showed his displeasure also. That was the risk of serving him closely as his personal servant or cook. One day Govinda dāsī was cooking a cereal for Prabhupāda’s breakfast when he walked past the kitchen, looked in, and asked, “What are you cooking?”\n“I am making cereal, Swamiji,” she replied.\n“But today is Ekādaśī,” said Prabhupāda.\n“Oh, thank you, Swamiji. I didn’t know.” She thought that by his reminder she had not actually done anything wrong. After all, neither he nor anyone else had eaten the grains. But Prabhupāda began to criticize her with a severity that surprised her. It was a great disqualification on her part, he said, to cook grains on Ekādaśī, the day when devotees fast from all grains. He kept repeating that she had cooked grains on Ekādaśī and described her mistake as very serious; her one mistake seemed to indicate a whole wrong mentality. Govinda dāsī finally felt it was as bad as if she had actually eaten grains, so she fasted entirely for the rest of the day.\nMany things had to be done exactly right. When Upendra placed a small amount of salt on Prabhupāda’s plate in front of the rice, it made it difficult for Prabhupāda to eat the rice without mixing it in the salt. Prabhupāda mentioned it. But when Upendra did it again the next day, Prabhupāda said, “I told you to put the salt in back of the rice, not in front!” And foregoing his own pleasure, due to his servant’s foolishness, Prabhupāda added, “Now give me no more salt.” The next day, however, Upendra put salt and pepper in separate containers and placed them beside the plate so Prabhupāda could move them as he liked. Prabhupāda accepted them silently. Whenever a mistake was rectified, he seemed to immediately forget the wrong.\nMukunda:Itwas in this period that Prabhupāda went to visit Mr. B. K. Nehru, who was a big Indian government official. I drove Prabhupāda to the St. Francis Hotel in a beat-up old Ford with the name Kṛṣṇa stenciled in multicolors in three different places on the car. The St. Francis Hotel, of course, is a very elite hotel. We arrived at the front door and there was a doorman. I got out and asked him if we could leave the car in front of the hotel for about fifteen minutes. Somehow, I don’t know why, he immediately agreed to look after the car. We went up to one of the top floors of the building to a very beautiful suite. Mr. Nehru greeted us. He was wearing Western clothes. I was also wearing Western clothes, and my head wasn’t shaved. Mr. Nehru’s wife was also there. I sat on the same couch as Prabhupāda, with Mr. Nehru in the middle and Prabhupāda on the other end.\nIn the beginning they spoke English. Prabhupāda reiterated some of his past life history and mentioned that he had had a pharmacy called Prayag Pharmacy. He had met Mr. Nehru in India, and Mr. Nehru acknowledged that he knew about the pharmacy. Prabhupāda then explained how he had takensannyāsa.I noted that Prabhupāda was very warm and friendly. It was a side of him that I had never seen before. Not that he hadn’t been warm and friendly, but to a nondevotee person, I had never seen him quite in such a friendly attitude. I was totally intrigued to see how open and almost intimate Prabhupāda was becoming with this man. I noticed that Prabhupāda was presenting himself as a mendicant, asannyāsī.\nAnd then the rest of the conversation took place in Hindi. It was a wonderful time for me to observe the facial expressions and gestures and the great depth of feeling with which Prabhupāda communicated, because I had to try to guess what he was talking about. In fact, I was always speculating on what he might be saying. Then of course Mr. Nehru and sometimes his wife would interject remarks – all in Hindi. I was spinning enormous fantasies about what they all might be talking about. Prabhupāda had introduced me as Michael Grant, secretary, and I was sitting on top of the world from the beginning of the conversation. I felt that I had a stake in the conversation, that maybe Mr. Nehru is not aware that I am not understanding. I was very tuned in to the mood of the conversation even though I was not understanding it, but thinking that maybe I was understanding part of it, and trying to act as if I might know something about what they were saying. At some point in the conversation I was getting very involved in my fantasies of what it was about, and I heard the wordsmissionary workcome from Prabhupāda. He stopped and looked at me momentarily – there was a beat, and then the conversation resumed. I then realized that I had really been tuned in by that. Prabhupāda was asking something. Then, later in the conversation, he said in English, “But one word from you,” to Mr. Nehru. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda’s eyes opened wide and he paused, and I believe he looked around at me at that time. Then after a somewhat awkward silence, the conversation resumed again. Then I knew that Śrīla Prabhupāda was really asking for a favor and that he was letting me in on this by saying it in English. I felt that all I could do was try to look very serious and important somehow, such that this man would think that by my presence, as an American disciple, he could see that Śrīla Prabhupāda was doing great things by converting us Westerners to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Somehow I wanted to help. But I didn’t know what it was, so I couldn’t say; and I just tried to play the part that Śrīla Prabhupāda seemed to want me to play in this transcendental game. Then the conversation became very convivial and the subject had changed.\nLater, the wife of B. K. Nehru came forward and called Prabhupāda “Swamiji” and said something in Hindi and gave him something wrapped in tin foil. It was about the size of a small apple. Then they exchanged words, and Śrīla Prabhupāda was very warm and cordial with Mrs. Nehru. On the way out I asked Prabhupāda first of all what the conversation was about. He was very vague but said it was about some land that he had been trying to get in India, I think in Vṛndāvana. It may have been in litigation, I don’t know, but he was asking Mr. Nehru’s help. I asked whether he was going to help, and Śrīla Prabhupāda was again rather vague about it, but he indicated that he felt the meeting was successful, or at least a step in the right direction. Then I asked about Mr. Nehru’s wife, whether she was European or what, and Prabhupāda said, “No, she is a Parsi.” Then on the ride back Prabhupāda opened the tin foil, and in it was a huge date, the biggest one I have ever seen in my life. And he took it out and took a big bite out of it and then offered me the rest, which I took, of course!\nMukunda was also present with Prabhupāda in his room, along with a small group of devotees, when an earthquake took place. The telephone poles and wires began moving outside the window. The building trembled. No one said anything until Prabhupāda said, “What is this?” A devotee replied, “It’s an earthquake, Swamiji.” Prabhupāda said, “Oh.” And then the earthquake suddenly stopped. Everyone present was very intent on Prabhupāda’s reaction. He said, “We can just sit down and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nHe recounted the bombing of Calcutta during the war. “I was in the bomb shelter, and the bombs were falling; and I was thinking as I was chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa that if I had to die now, it would be wonderful to die while chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.” Mukunda and the other devotees felt secure being in Prabhupāda’s presence, even during the earthquake. They felt that no matter what catastrophe might happen, they could simply sit with him and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and be happy.\nWhen Prabhupāda had first returned from India, he had criticized Mukunda for failing to obtain the permanent residency status for him. Mukunda had only been able to obtain a temporary visitor’s visa. “Why did you do this?” Prabhupāda had asked him sharply. Mukunda made a few excuses, and Prabhupāda replied, “You do not understand.” Later Prabhupāda and Mukunda visited a local immigration office to seek the permanent residency status. The official who met with them was a woman. In the course of the routine conversation, Prabhupāda briefly mentioned the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The woman remarked, “It must be very difficult to follow such a discipline in your life.”\nPrabhupāda replied, “No, it is not. It’s just a question of remembering God.” Then he gave her an example. Just as a woman goes to work and has to think of many different things, yet she never forgets to dress properly, so one has to think of God despite worldly duties. The woman immigration official could understand.\nDuring the conversation, the recent earthquake was mentioned, and the woman said that the building they were in was “earthquake-proof.” After the meeting, when Prabhupāda was leaving, he said to Mukunda, “There is no such thing as ‘earthquake-proof,’ ” and he laughed.\nLīlāvatī’s main occupation was taking care of her baby daughter, Subhadrā. She would treasure different incidents in which Prabhupāda showed attention to her daughter. The first time he saw Subhadrā on returning from India, he said, “She is very fortunate.” And he quoted a verse from theBhagavad-gītāto the effect that theyogīwho does not complete his practice has a chance to be born in a family of piousbrāhmaṇas.Another time, noticing that Subhadrā was sleepy in his presence, Prabhupāda remarked laughingly, “Yes, young children and old men must take a lot of rest.” He also held the child several times and played with her. One time, when speaking to a roomful of people, Prabhupāda suddenly told Līlāvatī that her daughter was very warm and that she should take off her sweater. He had been speaking on a philosophical topic and had interrupted himself. Others in the room were taken aback to see that Prabhupāda was concerned about such a small child. When Prabhupāda was leaving in a car to go to a speaking engagement, Līlāvatī handed him a garland of narcissus flowers through the window of the car. He lowered his head in a humble way and said, “Thank you very much.” She then handed him three narcissus flowers that had not been used in the garland. He took them and said, “Oh? And this is from your daughter?” Līlāvatī laughed and said, “Yes, Swamiji,” and he said, “Oh, very nice.” Such thoughtful and clever remarks from Prabhupāda about her daughter totally encouraged Līlāvatī’s Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nKṛṣṇadāsa also got a chance to shave Prabhupāda’s head. Not many of the devotees in those days wore the Vaiṣṇavaśikhā,the tuft of hair at the back of the head. Prabhupāda had very little hair, but he did have aśikhāabout three inches in diameter at the back of his head. Thinking that only the disciples wore theśikhā,Kṛṣṇadāsa shaved off Prabhupāda’sśikhā.But Prabhupāda only mentioned it mildly: “Oh, you have cut off myśikhā.” On another occasion while shaving Prabhupāda’s head, Kṛṣṇadāsa cut him, but Prabhupāda didn’t notice it. He was chanting the whole while. But when Upendra came in and saw a bit of blood on Prabhupāda’s head, he exclaimed. Prabhupāda said, “What? What?” and put his hand to his head. “Oh, you’ve cut me,” said Prabhupāda. But that was all he said. Upendra later told Kṛṣṇadāsa that he had committed a great offense. That evening Kṛṣṇadāsa went to Prabhupāda and mentioned the cut. “There is no difficulty,” said Prabhupāda. “You are just a little young yet. Young don’t have a steady hand.”\nWith Upendra, Prabhupāda’s instructions were often in response to Upendra’s mistakes. Upendra followed Prabhupāda everywhere. Once they were walking downstairs on the way to the temple, and Upendra, walking behind, called out to Prabhupāda to get his attention. Prabhupāda turned around on the stairs, raised his cane, and said, “I told you never to call from behind.” On the way back from the temple, Upendra was supposed to carry Prabhupāda’sŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,eyeglasses, andkaratālas.One evening Upendra got sidetracked talking with a guest, and when he returned to the house, Prabhupāda was waiting for him. Govinda dāsī warned Upendra that Prabhupāda was angry at having to walk back to the house alone. Uttering apologies, Upendra entered his room. Prabhupāda said, “Whenever you are to do something, do it nicely. Do not be irresponsible.” One day Upendra was looking for Prabhupāda within the apartment, and he went into Govinda dāsī’s room to ask her where Prabhupāda was. As Upendra left Govinda dāsī’s room, he met Prabhupāda coming down the hall. Later Prabhupāda called him and told, “You are abrahmacārī.You should not be in the same room alone with Govinda dāsī or any girl. Do not do like that in the future.”\nWhen Govinda dāsī had to go to the doctor, Upendra, although having no experience, whimsically volunteered to take dictation from Prabhupāda as Prabhupāda answered his letters. Prabhupāda began to dictate quickly, and Upendra immediately ran into trouble trying to write down his words. At the end of the letter, Prabhupāda asked him to reread it, but Upendra couldn’t read his own handwriting because it had been scribbled with such speed. Prabhupāda looked at him incredulously, saying, “Why do you do things like that? You cannot read your own handwriting?” Upendra attempted to read but could not, and Prabhupāda had to fill in the whole letter again, while Upendra wrote in the words that he had missed or could not read.\nOne of Upendra’s regular duties was to crush up rock sugar candy, which Prabhupāda took in water as medicine. One evening, while Prabhupāda watched him, Upendra put the crushed sugar candy in water and mixed it by pouring the water from one glass to another. Somehow a glass slipped from his hand, and in trying to catch it, he splashed it all over his head, face, and the front of his body. Prabhupāda looked at him and simply said, “Go wash.”\n“No, no,” Upendra protested. “Let me finish making your medicine for you.” As he continued his work, the sugar water thickened, leaving his hands, face, and arms sticky as the sugar hardened and crystalized. Prabhupāda said nothing, but watched and accepted the service of his foolish but sincere disciple.\nPerhaps certain activities cannot be called instructions; they are simplylīlā.\nUpendra:At the Willard Street apartment, Prabhupāda would sometimes go out on the back porch. It was very small and wasn’t meant for walking, just for going down the back stairs two levels. But the people in the apartment below us had a little Pekingese dog that would bark at anyone who would come out above. The dog would run up the stairs to the next platform below and yap away with a shrill bark. Prabhupāda would go out and stand on the little porch, inciting the dog’s barking, and then ignore the dog. Then all of a sudden he would turn to the dog, raise his hands, and make a scary face. The Pekingese would become very frightened and would whimper and run down the stairs, while Prabhupāda would laugh. He did this a number of times, like a young boy."

        "chapter_title": "Opening a Temple in Los Angeles",
        "content": "Los AngelesJanuary 6, 1968\nThe building at 5364 West Pico Boulevard was a small storefront in a middle-class black neighborhood of Los Angeles. With his key, Aniruddha opened the rear door, and Śrīla Prabhupāda entered, followed by a few disciples.\nThe room was stark. A Brijabasi print of Lord Kṛṣṇa sat atop the altar, which was no more than two orange crates covered with an old madras. A tamboura and amṛdaṅgaon end stood in one corner, and a curtain hung over the front window. Prabhupāda’s seat, a simple raised platform, was the only furniture.\nPrabhupāda, dressed in saffron robes and walking with a cane, crossed the room, opened the front door, and stepped outside. Glancing up and down the street, he saw small, run-down houses. It was a quiet, out-of-the-way neighborhood, unlike the more vital locations his disciples had found in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury and Manhattan’s Lower East Side. But it was a place in Los Angeles, a start.\nPrabhupāda stepped back inside and shut the door. Aniruddha, Dayānanda, his wife Nandarāṇī, and their three-week-old daughter Candramukhī were there – the members of the Los Angeles temple. Several other devotees who had driven down a few days earlier from San Francisco were also there and stood anxiously around Prabhupāda, waiting to hear what he would say.\nPrabhupāda looked around carefully. “All right,” he said, “let us havekīrtana.And picking up themṛdaṅga,he sat down on the small platform while his disciples sat down before him on the floor.\nNo sooner had he begun to play, however, when Jānakī rushed over to him, carrying the tamboura. “Swamiji,” she said, “you can’t play the drum! You’re not well enough! Play this.” Her reprimand was motherly. Prabhupāda was seventy-two and only six months ago had been hospitalized after a heart attack and stroke. He had only recently returned from India, where he had gone to recuperate. Naturally his disciples were concerned about his health.\n“All right.” Prabhupāda smiled, trading instruments with Jānakī. “Then I will play tamboura.”\nAs Śrīla Prabhupāda softly plucked the metal strings, his disciples clapped the one-two-threerhythm. Prabhupāda chanted: “Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.” With his traditional Bengali melody he led the singing, joining with his disciples on the chorus.\nAs Prabhupāda’s disciples sat earnestly chanting before him – some of them looking up to him, others singing with eyes closed – he looked at each disciple. Nervous, timid Aniruddha was there; he blushed easily, and his bespectacled eyes squinted when he smiled. Tall, lean Dayānanda was there; he had a good job as a computer technician for RCA, and he was giving two hundred dollars monthly to support the temple he and his wife had started.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had been in India when Dayānanda and Nandarāṇī had moved to Los Angeles and found this little storefront. Immediately, they had written to him about the new “temple” and the warm, sunny Los Angeles climate, which they said would be good for his health. He had expressed his eagerness to join them.\nDayānanda and Nandarāṇī had written to Prabhupāda that people in Los Angeles weren’t as receptive as in San Francisco and New York, but Prabhupāda had assured them that if they chanted with devotion, success would come. Kṛṣṇa would help them.\nIn his room at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple in Vṛndāvana, Prabhupāda had meditated on sending young men and women like Dayānanda and Nandarāṇī all over the world to open Kṛṣṇa conscious centers. Despite old age and ill health, this was his life’s ambition, his single dominating desire. And in whatever time he had left, he wanted to establish the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement worldwide. His success in America over the past two years had given him hope. Mukunda had begun a temple in San Francisco, Kīrtanānanda had begun one in Montreal, Satsvarūpa in Boston, Subala in Santa Fe, and Brahmānanda had stayed in New York. These temples were storefronts only, and the leaders young, inexperienced men. But the Western youth were showing interest. There was great potential.\nAfter thekīrtana,Dayānanda drove Prabhupāda to his apartment two miles away. It was small – a front room, a kitchenette, a back room with a tiny bathroom – and noisy. Aniruddha had arranged for Gaurasundara and his wife, Govinda dāsī, who were acting as Prabhupāda’s servant and secretary, to stay in the front room.\nPrabhupāda said his health was still not good. His sleep was often disturbed, and he spoke of a “gong-gong-gong” sound in his head. He had occasional headaches and a ringing in his left ear. An Ayurvedic doctor in India had told him to take cinnamon buds, and he had seen a doctor in San Francisco. But the doctors’ prescriptions had not helped.\nPrabhupāda was in good spirits, however, despite his age and lingering sickness. He appeared strong, and six months in India had tanned him a golden, healthy hue. He always sat straight and smiled often. He walked with a cane, yet upright, with a quick step, tiring his young disciples who attempted to keep up with him. He even mentioned that if his inability to sleep continued, he would have more time for writing his books.\nGone was the mindlessness of his young followers who had previously thought that Swamiji, because he was a pure devotee, should be let to do any strenuous activities he liked, working all night or singing and playing themṛdaṅgafor hours in the park. Now the devotees had become concerned and protective, trying always to arrange for his ease, suggesting when they thought something was too strenuous for him. Usually, however, Prabhupāda would give the last word on what he would or would not do. When Yamunā and Jānakī arrived from San Francisco, they decided that if Swamiji were to get well he would require a special diet. So they devised a regimen featuring small servings of boiled vegetables without salt, spices, or ghee. At first Prabhupāda gently submitted to their requests. But on trying their meals, he commented, “These vegetables are nasty. They are not fit for eating.” After three days, when Govinda dāsī told him of some new reductions in his diet, he roared, “Let the starvation committee go to hell! You feed me.”\nAgain Prabhupāda began taking his regular lunch –dāl,rice,capātīs,and a couple ofsabjīswith ghee. One day when Govinda dāsī brought him his lunch, he commented, “Oh, this is very nice. When I was in India everyone told me, ‘Oh, Swamiji, you cannot go to America. You will starve there. They have no food. They eat only meats and potatoes.’ So I said, ‘What is that? I shall live on bread and potatoes. There is no problem. I can survive on bread and potatoes.’ So I was thinking like that when I came to your country – that I shall live on bread and potatoes. But now I have come here, and Kṛṣṇa is so kind. He has not only given me everything in the way of nice food, but you are also cooking all sorts of nice vegetable preparations –capātīs, dāl,rice. Everything is there. So this is Kṛṣṇa’s kindness.”\nAlthough when Prabhupāda had first arrived in America he had been alone and had had difficulty finding even a single sincere person, now he was surrounded by sincere students eager to learn from him. Still, he accepted this new position in the same spirit as he had accepted the lonely months in New York City. He was doing his beloved duty to his spiritual master: writing books, seeking to engage others in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness mission, and speaking about Kṛṣṇa always.\nSometimes, as Prabhupāda would shuffle through the apartment in his slippers, he would see Gaurasundara and Govinda dāsī seated at the kitchen table practicing their first lessons in the Bengali alphabet. He had given them a Bengali verse fromCaitanya-caritāmṛtato memorize, and regularly he would drill them to see if they knew it.\nLooking over their shoulders, Prabhupāda remarked, “This is very nice. Just like a child is learning to write. His writing may not be perfect. It may be crooked or imperfect. But the teacher wants to see that the students are trying. It doesn’t matter how well they are doing, but just that they are fully engaged. So it is just like our service to Kṛṣṇa. What can we do for Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is everything. He doesn’t need our service. But He wants to see that we are trying – we are trying a little bit to give Him service. That is the whole idea.”\nIt was only four days after Prabhupāda’s arrival. He had just risen from an afternoon’s rest, walked into the front room … and there was Subala. Prabhupāda was surprised. Subala was supposed to be in Santa Fe.\n“My wife has left me,” Subala burst out. And a sad tale followed. Subala told how he had left his wife, Kṛṣṇā-devī dāsī, alone at the Santa Fe temple for a few days and gone to New York to visit his parents. Meanwhile, Kṛṣṇā-devī had run away with a boy who had been visiting the temple; and she had decided to stay with him and give up her husband.\n“Don’t worry,” Prabhupāda told Subala, “everything will be all right. I will write a letter to Kṛṣṇā-devī and tell her to come back to you. You can go back to Santa Fe tomorrow, and everything will be all right.”\nSubala left the next morning for Santa Fe, and Prabhupāda, although calm in Subala’s presence, began to show deep disturbance over the sordid affair. Kṛṣṇā-devī was his disciple, and he had performed the sacred marriage ceremony for her and Subala. He had asked them to be an ideal couple, cooperating together in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Together they had gone to start the center in New Mexico. “Don’t be discouraged,” he told them. “Even though no one may come to hear you, still you chant and hear.” But now Kṛṣṇā-devī had simply left the temple and her husband.\nWhen Subala arrived in Santa Fe, he found that Kṛṣṇā-devī and her boyfriend, Randy, had left town. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles Prabhupāda received a letter from Kṛṣṇā-devī. She said she wanted to stay in Kṛṣṇa consciousness – but with her new boyfriend. “This is all nonsense,” Prabhupāda exclaimed. “I will simply go back to Vṛndāvana and sit and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Why should I do this? Why should I deal with this quarrel between husband and wife? This is not the business of asannyāsī.”\nPrabhupāda wrote a letter to Kṛṣṇā-devī in care of the Santa Fe temple.\nTo Subala, Prabhupāda wrote,\nBut before Prabhupāda’s letter arrived, Subala had already left Santa Fe for Los Angeles, thinking, “I can’t take this anymore. I’m going back to Swamiji.”\nSitting on his porch taking his noontime massage, Prabhupāda suddenly saw Subala, looking more miserable than ever, coming up the sidewalk. “Subala,” Prabhupāda called out, remaining seated. Subala approached and offered obeisances before Śrīla Prabhupāda, who sat in the California sunshine and dressed only in an Indiangamchā,while Gaurasundara massaged him with mustard oil. “You did not get my letter?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“No,” Subala replied.\n“Yes.” Prabhupāda nodded. “You have got my letter. I have written you and told you that if you are feeling too heavy-hearted, you may come here and live with me for some time.”\nSubala:So I moved into the crowded front room of Swamiji’s apartment. I slept in the living room, right outside of Swamiji’s room, and there was only a curtain separating us. At night I could hear him dictatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nHe asked me to carve some Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities for him. I had already carved some Jagannātha deities, and now Swamiji said he wanted Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities carved. So I bought a block of mahagony and began carving Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.\nPrabhupāda received word from Rāya Rāma in New York that his editing of theBhagavad-gītāmanuscript was “nearing completion.” When Prabhupāda read Rāya Rāma’s letter, he exploded: “Nearing completion! I heard this before I started for India.” Rāya Rāma’s slow editing was delaying the manuscript too much. Although the contract with Macmillan Company had already been signed, the manuscript had still not been submitted. Seeing Rāya Rāma’s editing as a perpetual delay, Prabhupāda decided Rāya Rāma should immediately stop all other duties and come to Los Angeles.\nAfter a few days, Rāya Rāma arrived. He, too, settled into the crowded front room of Swamiji’s tiny apartment, picking a corner for himself where he could work on theBhagavad-gītāmanuscript. After having spoken in the temple in Swamiji’s presence one night, Rāya Rāma wrote home to the devotees in New York,\nOne day on a walk, Prabhupāda discovered a special place across the street from his apartment. There on a neighbor’s front lawn stood a broad, tall tree. Taking a few disciples with him, Prabhupāda went over and sat down beneath the tree. On a warm Los Angeles afternoon, this was a great but simple luxury, sitting in the pleasant sunny atmosphere beneath the shade tree. Rāya Rāma considered the occasion something to write to the devotees in New York about.\nSwamiji said that saintly persons in India often sat under trees and even lived there with no other shelter. The six Gosvāmīs, who wrote books under the order of Lord Caitanya, lived this way in Vṛndāvana, staying each night under a different tree and compiling sublime Sanskrit literatures. Hearing Swamiji speak on such transcendental subjects in this setting fit perfectly the devotees’ ideal notions of thegurubeneath an ancient towering banyan tree in India. It didn’t seem to them that they were sitting in an ordinary neighborhood of Los Angeles. Often Aniruddha would return to the apartment after shopping or errands, and he would see from afar “this gorgeous-looking, saffron-robed person sitting there on the grassy lawn.”\nOne day as Subala, Govinda dāsī, Rāya Rāma, and others sat with Prabhupāda in the shade, Prabhupāda observed a pair of white butterflies. “Just see these worms,” he said, pointing to the butterflies. “Here also there is husband and wife. The whole world is in this bondage.”\nKnowing Subala was still lamenting, Prabhupāda continued to speak about the topic on both their minds. “It is not so wonderful that Kṛṣṇā-devī has left,” he said. “What is wonderful is thatweare able to stay and serve Kṛṣṇa. Themāyāis so strong. It is Kṛṣṇa’s divine energy. And for someone to actually stay engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service is very rare. The living entity is practically helpless under the sway ofmāyā’spower and can only cry out to Kṛṣṇa for help. But we have to pray at every moment that the power ofmāyādoes not disturb us.”\nSubala continued to live with Prabhupāda, cooking for him, tending to his personal needs, and carving Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda wrote Kṛṣṇā-devī again.\nOne day after a walk, Prabhupāda told Aniruddha that Los Angeles reminded him of Bombay and that he wanted to build a very big temple in Los Angeles. Although Aniruddha was not one to endeavor hard for building a big temple, Prabhupāda still told him his vision. Another day Prabhupāda called Aniruddha in and showed him the Deity of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa that Gaurasundara and Subala had carved. Prabhupāda’s eyes were shining. “I want to have Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities in everyone’s home,” he said. Aniruddha was amazed by the joyful expression on Prabhupāda’s face.\n“What can I do?” Aniruddha asked.\n“I want you to go to different foundries and find out the cost of casting Deities.”\nAniruddha and Subala then phoned and visited various foundries in the Los Angeles area, returning with information. But their investigations were unbusinesslike and not well thought out. Knowing this, Prabhupāda smiled and asked, “So, what intelligent news do you have for me today?” Aniruddha knew Prabhupāda was criticizing him, but he could only giggle in return. He loved it.\nOne morning Aniruddha went to see Prabhupāda with what he considered a frightening story. Before dawn he had been out in the park collecting eucalyptus twigs for Prabhupāda to use as toothbrushes. He had been standing on a park bench cutting the branch of a tree with his knife when a police car had suddenly pulled up and a policeman had rushed out of the car. “What are you doing?” the policeman demanded. Aniruddha explained that he was getting toothbrushes for his spiritual master. The policeman had said, “Don’t you know that these trees belong to the city? They belong to the people of California.” He had said that Aniruddha could be arrested for carrying an open knife. When he had asked Aniruddha what was in the bag around his neck, Aniruddha had shown him his beads. The policeman had then asked if Aniruddha had come from a mental institution.\nPrabhupāda smiled to hear the story and inquired, “Did you ask him ifhewas crazy?”\nGovinda dāsī had been complaining to Aniruddha that Swamiji’s apartment was too noisy and crowded and that there were no private bathroom facilities for Swamiji. She kept insisting Aniruddha find a better place. Aniruddha, however, was getting only two hundred dollars a month from Dayānanda, and with Prabhupāda plus so many visitors, there was a financial strain. “Swamiji is very uncomfortable,” Govinda dāsī nagged. But Aniruddha didn’t know what to do.\nWhen Aniruddha asked Prabhupāda if the place was all right, he said it was. Aniruddha explained that more devotees were eager to visit from San Francisco and would probably want to stay in the apartment. “Personally,” Prabhupāda said, “I have no suggestion myself. It is up to them, whatever they decide.”\nPrabhupāda had his translating to do, but he also wanted to see his disciples. For Aniruddha, however, the prospect of more devotees coming to visit was a cause of anxiety. Finally, he and Dayānanda found a larger apartment for Swamiji.\nThe new apartment was four rooms over a private garage in the rear of an apartment complex. Aniruddha painted, and some of the other devotees helped prepare the apartment as comfortably as possible for Prabhupāda. Then they moved him in.\nThe landlord, a small Japanese man, came by and, seeing Prabhupāda seated on the floor behind his trunk, asked, “Where’s your furniture?” He seemed suspicious.\nPrabhupāda smiled, thanked him, and said it was all right.\n“We can sit down anywhere,” Prabhupāda explained. “We are mendicant.” But after leaving, the landlord kept standing outside on the landing, peeking through the window. “Tell him to go away,” Prabhupāda said to Aniruddha.\nAt the temple during the evening program, Śrīla Prabhupāda would sometimes ask one of his disciples to speak after thekīrtana.\nDayānanda:One night as I was driving Swamiji to the temple, he asked me to speak.Iimmediately thought I would rather not. Although in Swamiji’s absence his other disciples had given talks, I had never given even an informal talk. So I told Swamiji I preferred to hear him speak, but he said he preferred to hear me. So it was settled.\nAt the temple we hadkīrtanaas usual, and then I began to speak. I was speaking on the validity of God, trying to prove that God’s existence was logical and scientifically reasonable. Such a talk should have been given with reference to the Vedic literature, but my fund of knowledge was not embellished by verses from the scripture, nor was it even adequately based on basic Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy. I was aware that my talk wasn’t adequate, a fact that Prabhupāda himself brought home in the sweetest possible way.\nWhen at one point I made a mistake and said the wrong thing altogether, Prabhupāda matter-of-factly interrupted, explaining the point I had misstated. He then motioned me to go on. I continued without any loss of face. I was being corrected in public, but without the embarrassment that a chastisement might cause. Swamiji’s correction was always based on love and sincerity – in relation to the goal rather than to the ego.\nOn the appearance day of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s spiritual master, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, Prabhupāda gathered some of his disciples – Aniruddha, Govinda dāsī, Gaurasundara, Nandarāṇī, and a boy named Saṅkarṣaṇa – for a special celebration. In the kitchen of his apartment, Prabhupāda cooked a feast for his spiritual master. Nandarāṇī brought flowers, and Prabhupāda led the devotees in a ceremony of offering flowers and chanting prayers in honor of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.\nNandarāṇī:I had my daughter, Candramukhī, with me then. She was about two months old and was sitting very quietly in a little basket in a corner of the room. After the ceremony, Swamiji gathered a handful of flowers, walked over to the basket where Candramukhī was lying, and placed the flowers around her head. He smiled and said, “One day I will take you to India with me.”\nAfter the feast the devotees followed Prabhupāda into his room. He sat at his desk and read letters aloud to the small gathering of his disciples seated on the floor before him. The letters were of appreciation. And these letters became Śrīla Prabhupāda’s offering to his spiritual master. Prabhupāda read aloud statements like, “We really like chanting,” “We’re happy since we met you,” “We’re trying to teach other people how to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa” – simple sentiments.\nReading the letters, Prabhupāda became very happy. He then put the letters along with the flowers before the picture of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. Then looking at Nandarāṇī, he asked, “Have you become happy since you have been chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?”\n“Oh, yes,” Nandarāṇī replied, “my life is wonderful.”\nLooking at the others, Prabhupāda asked, “And what about you? Do you feel more satisfied since you have been chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?” They all answered yes.\n“Then I have only one request,” Prabhupāda continued. “Whatever happiness you have felt, you simply tell someone else about that. That is all you have to do. You don’t need to teach anything. You don’t need to teach the philosophy. You just explain to people that because you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa you have become happy, and if they chant, they will become happy. Then I will be satisfied, and my spiritual master will be satisfied.”\nAs Śrīla Prabhupāda entered the storefront one evening, he was surprised to find Umāpati there to greet him. Umāpati had left Kṛṣṇa consciousness almost a year ago, and Prabhupāda had not seen him since. Spontaneously, Prabhupāda went forward and embraced Umāpati. A few months before, Umāpati had written, indicating that he was thinking of returning; so his arrival was not a complete surprise to Śrīla Prabhupāda. As Prabhupāda took his seat, he asked Umāpati about the devotees in New York. Briefly Prabhupāda reminisced how he had begun his movement in New York and how boys like Umāpati had helped him.\nLater that evening, back at the apartment, Prabhupāda expressed sadness that some of his disciples had left Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He told Umāpati that when the wife of one of thesannyāsīdisciples of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had forcibly dragged her husband away, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had shed tears over his inability to save the disciple. A disciple, due tomāyā’sinfluence, may fall away, Prabhupāda said, but the spiritual master will never forsake him.\nUmāpati had left Kṛṣṇa consciousness because of intellectual doubts. Having been an eclectic follower of Buddhism, he had objected to Prabhupāda’s explanations of Buddhism. On leaving Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, he had simply returned to his old job in a radio station, grown back his beard, and reverted to his old habits. “Whenever I saw someone doing something wrong, like eating meat,” Umāpati explained to Prabhupāda, “I would think, ‘My spiritual master said this is bad.’ ”\n“When you think like that,” Prabhupāda said, “your life at once becomes sublime.”\nSeveral other devotees entered Prabhupāda’s room as Prabhupāda talked. As a person becomes more Kṛṣṇa conscious, Prabhupāda explained, he becomes concerned not to cause suffering to other living beings. He doesn’t want to cause suffering, even to a small insect. “Don’t you feel?” Prabhupāda asked, imploring them with his eyes to understand the nonviolence of the devotee.\nSeeing that Prabhupāda was almost constantly occupied by various disciples, Līlāvatī, one of the girls visiting from San Francisco, decided not to take up her spiritual master’s time unnecessarily. Prabhupāda noticed her frequent absence from the gatherings at his apartment. When she finally visited him, he asked her, “Why are you not coming?”\n“Oh, Swamiji,” Līlāvatī said, “you must do your translating work. I don’t think you’re getting your work done.”\n“No, you don’t know?” Prabhupāda corrected her mistake. “Don’t you know my disciples are my work?”\nPrabhupāda said he would go to as many speaking engagements as Aniruddha could obtain. Aniruddha got engagements, but there were many difficulties. On two occasions, Prabhupāda, Subala, and Aniruddha were on their way to an engagement at a college when their car broke down. Another time, a policeman arrested Subala for not having a driver’s license, and Prabhupāda, accompanied by his servant, had to walk back to his apartment. At an engagement at the U.C.L.A. Student Center, not a single student attended; Prabhupāda sat waiting for ten minutes and then turned to Aniruddha: “So, what happened?” At an outdoor engagement at Long Beach State College, there was no seat for Prabhupāda, and Aniruddha had to run and find an umbrella to shade Prabhupāda from the sun. “Aniruddha, this is not very nice,” Prabhupāda remarked from the podium.\nBut there were successes also. Mukunda dāsa arranged for Prabhupāda to appear on national television on theLesCrane Show.He also arranged for Prabhupāda to appear on theJoe Pyne Show,as well as on several radio programs. AndLifemagazine featured Prabhupāda’s picture and an accompanying story as part of an article, “The Year of the Guru.”\nAlthough Aniruddha was prepared to arrange preaching engagements for Prabhupāda for as long as he would stay, the devotees in San Francisco, New York, Montreal, and Boston had repeatedly asked Prabhupāda to visit them. He had gone to India in July 1967, returning to San Francisco December 14. He had stayed in San Francisco three weeks and in Los Angeles two months. So while his disciples in San Francisco and Los Angeles had seen him, the others had been waiting for more than eight months. It was time to move on.\nOn March 7, the day Prabhupāda left Los Angeles, he thanked Aniruddha for his service in maintaining the center.\n“Despite my ill health,” he said, “I was very comfortably situated. Kṛṣṇa will bless you.”\n“Actually, what did I do?” Aniruddha replied. “Everything was a mistake. All the engagements were messed up.”\n“No,” Prabhupāda said, “that’s all right. You tried your best.”\nAs Prabhupāda was leaving for the airport, he had to walk from his apartment to the car. It was raining, and he had no umbrella or raincoat. Govinda dāsī frantically ran into the bathroom, tore down the shower curtain, and wrapped it around her spiritual master to protect him from the rain.\nPrabhupāda had unlimited plans for expansion – a big city like Los Angeles deserved a big temple, organized distribution of books on Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and sophisticated cultural programs. And there should be Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in every home. Yet while enthusiastically planning to make everyone and everything Kṛṣṇa conscious, Prabhupāda waited patiently to see if a stray disciple like Kṛṣṇā-devī would return. Prabhupāda was ready to appear on television or meet boldly with any challenger or travel anywhere in the world, and yet he allowed Govinda dāsī to cover him with a shower curtain against the rain.\nThe Los Angeles temple would become a great Kṛṣṇa conscious success only with hard work and sincerity. And that, Prabhupāda knew, would take time. His disciples were not yet so well trained as to make formidable advances for Kṛṣṇa against the forces ofmāyā.Yet by his staying for two months in Los Angeles, he was strengthening his disciples’ Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And they would continue to progress. ISKCON L.A. was now a little stronger. A few devotees were going to stay and help. He would come back when they had done more.\nSan FranciscoMarch 8, 1968Śrīla Prabhupāda flew from Los Angeles to San Francisco. After the slower pace of the Los Angeles center, the activities in San Francisco encouraged Prabhupāda.\nThe morning and evening meetings drew crowds of interested young people, and Śrīla Prabhupāda observed: “Dancing in ecstasy is often exhibited to the transcendental pleasure of everyone present.”\nPrabhupāda was witnessing the success of thesaṅkīrtanamovement. He had planted the seed, and now the plant ofkṛṣṇa-bhaktiwas flowering. To revisit a center and see that his disciples, by sincerely following his orders, were advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness increased Prabhupāda’s bliss and satisfaction. He was witnessing the power ofkīrtanato transform the fallen souls. And to see his smile of approval increased the ecstasy of the devotees.\nGurudāsa reviewed the slides. Sure enough, Kartā Mahāśaya had become bluer and plumper. “Has He been painted or anything?” Umāpati asked. Gurudāsa said they hadn’t done anything to Him.\n“You have been taking care of Him,” Prabhupāda affirmed.\nBhakti-yogawas a scientific law; as one approached Kṛṣṇa, He reciprocated. Wherever Prabhupāda’s disciples were following the process carefully, he saw the improvement. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he said, was a treatment of the diseased soul by medicine and diet. The medicine was chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and the diet wasprasādam.If one followed this program, he would be rejuvenated; if one neglected it, he would relapse. Śrīla Prabhupāda found both health and illness.\nUpendra, Prabhupāda’s personal servant in San Francisco, came before Prabhupāda crying. He said he couldn’t overcome his sex urge. He had engaged in illicit sex. When he asked if Kṛṣṇa forgives offenses, Prabhupāda consoled him: “Yes, Kṛṣṇa forgives.” Upendra asked if he could overcome his lust by getting married. “No, you are too young,” Prabhupāda said. “You should stay away from rich food. Eat starvishly.” He told Upendra to take unspiceddālandcapātīswithout butter.\nAfter a few weeks in San Francisco, Śrīla Prabhupāda flew to New York, where the devotees greeted him with a grand airport reception. A city newspaper ran an article “Guru Returns.” The New York center at 26 Second Avenue had improved, and there were new faces and enthusiastickīrtanas.\nPrabhupāda stayed in his old rooms at 26 Second Avenue. Although there had been talk of getting him another residence, everything had been too expensive. Prabhupāda had assured Brahmānanda, “I would like to stay in my apartment. If it is silent and solitary I feel pleasure to live there, better than elsewhere.” Although Śrīla Prabhupāda’s plans were to stay in New York less than two weeks, he talked of staying longer – if his disciples could arrange for him to work steadily at his translating and would help him publish his books one after another. Prabhupāda had written Brahmānanda,\nOne day, while Prabhupāda was sitting in his room receiving his massage, he began talking and laughing. As he sat on the floor with one leg tucked under his body and one leg outstretched before him, he told the two or three devotees present how Kṛṣṇa, carrying the lunch His mother had packed for Him, would go to the forest with His cowherd boyfriends, who were also carrying lunches from home. Kṛṣṇa and His friends would all sit together sharing their lunch, and Kṛṣṇa always had the bestlaḍḍusandkacaurīs.Prabhupāda’s eyes flashed, and he rubbed his hands together, smiling. “I simply want to go to Kṛṣṇaloka so I can have some of Kṛṣṇa’slaḍḍuandkacaurīs.I do not have any great diversion from this. I simply want to go there so that I can enjoy eatinglaḍḍusandkacaurīswith Kṛṣṇa and the cowherd boys.” Opening his eyes widely, he glanced at Devānanda, who was massaging him, and at the others in the room. “Oh,” he said to them, “if you will give melaḍḍusandkacaurīs,then I will bless you.”\n“Swamiji, please teach us how to makelaḍḍusandkacaurīs,”the devotees replied excitedly. “We will definitely make them for you!”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda assured them, “I shall show you. I shall teach you.” And he went on talking in a jovial way.\nNewcomers in New York wanted to be initiated. One boy had seen Prabhupāda’s picture inLifemagazine, cut it out, and put it in his high school locker. A boy named Jay, after having read about Prabhupāda and the devotees inEvergreen Review,had visited the temple and found that everyone was devoted to Prabhupāda. Some disciples whom Prabhupāda had initiated by mail – like Indirā and Ekāyanī, two sisters still in high school and living at home – were meeting their spiritual master for the first time. Prabhupāda initiated all the eligible newcomers.\nThe day before Prabhupāda left for Boston, he lectured at the New York State University at Stonybrook, a two-hour drive from the temple.\nBrahmānanda:The engagement was in a huge auditorium with rows of seats. And the house was full. The bleachers were completely packed when we came in. It was dark, just some spotlights on us and everything else was dark. The rows of seats went back and up, and we could hardly see the audience. First we heldkīrtanaand then Prabhupāda spoke. As Prabhupāda was speaking, we could hear the sound of chairs popping up as the students were getting up and leaving. But Prabhupāda just went right on lecturing, as if he weren’t aware of it. By the time the lecture was over, there were only about two dozen people left.\nAfter the program, the devotees discovered that the car Prabhupāda was supposed to ride in had already left. A student stepped forward, however, and offered his Triumph sports car, a tiny two-seater. Prabhupāda didn’t like the car, but it was the only thing available. So Brahmānanda drove Prabhupāda back to Manhattan.\nAround midnight, Prabhupāda dozed while Brahmānanda speeded, hurrying to get back to the temple as soon as possible. Prabhupāda was dozing peacefully when Brahmānanda hit a large pothole, and Prabhupāda struck his head on the metal bar on the roof of the car.\nWhen finally they returned to the Lower East Side it was past midnight, and there would only be a few hours for resting before Prabhupāda would have to catch his 9:00 A.M. flight to Boston. Although Prabhupāda rose that morning on schedule, most of the devotees were still asleep when he left his apartment. At the airport Prabhupāda commented that his disciples, rather than simply praising him, should try to follow his example and rise early."

        "chapter_title": "A Visit to Boston",
        "content": "BostonMay 1968\nTHE APARTMENT WAS near the elevated train line in a rough lower-class neighborhood of Boston. But it was the best Satsvarūpa could afford. Just before Śrīla Prabhupāda had left for India on July 24, 1967, he had sent Satsvarūpa here to Boston, affectionately rubbing his hand up and down Satsvarūpa’s back as a blessing.\nAt first Satsvarūpa had been alone, working full time at the Welfare Department, hoping to find a storefront suitable for a center. Then Haṁsadūta and his wife, Himavatī, had joined him, as had Jadurāṇī, who had been having difficulty doing her artwork in the New York temple. Haṁsadūta cooked, Himavatī helped him and did the housecleaning, Jadurāṇī painted, and Satsvarūpa went to his job. On Sundays they would chant on the Boston Common.\nIn September Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote from Vṛndāvana, expressing pleasure that even in his absence his disciples had opened a Kṛṣṇa consciousness center in Boston. “Physically I may be present or not,” he wrote, “but the work must continue … . Kindly make the Boston center very nice.” He closed, “The prospect there is very good due to the large number of students.”\nThe Boston devotees considered Prabhupāda’s letter very important, and as they studied and quoted the letter, it strengthened their convictions. While cooking, Haṁsadūta would think about what Prabhupāda had said in his letter; Satsvarūpa would meditate on the letter while riding to work on the train and chanting on his beads; and the women, who sometimes quarreled – usually about why Jadurāṇī didn’t keep her room clean – would improve the quality of their conversation by referring to Prabhupāda’s recent letter.\nAfter a couple of months in Boston, Satsvarūpa found a tiny storefront for rent. Even before he was able to get a key and see inside, he wrote Prabhupāda about the little storefront situated among student apartment buildings near Boston University.\nWhen Satsvarūpa had gained entrance to the storefront for the first time, he had come alone and had checked out the bare front room, the basement, and the oil burner. Just as he was about to leave, however, he spotted a blue aerogram on the floor. Although it lay only a few feet from the door, he hadn’t noticed it on entering. Picking the aerogram up, he saw that it was from Swamiji in Calcutta. It was as if Swamiji were there to greet him – a miracle!\nAs Satsvarūpa tore open the blue aerogram, he considered how it had traveled from hand to hand, originating with Swamiji in his room in Calcutta, and had flown to America, mixed in with thousands of other letters in a large mail bag, and had been separated and brought here to a building where no one lived. Yet the mailman had put it through the chute, and it had glided a few feet and landed on the floor, where it had sat for days. This was, of course, no more than the miracle of the postal service. But what the postman could not have possibly appreciated was thatso muchwas being carried in that lightweight aerogram. Sitting on the window shelf, Satsvarūpa read Swamiji’s words.\nSatsvarūpa took the letter as confirmation that they should take this building. But as there was little space and no hot water, and as Himavatī was pregnant, Haṁsadūta decided to move with his wife to the Montreal temple. At the same time, however, another disciple, Pradyumna, moved to Boston. So Satsvarūpa, Jadurāṇī, and Pradyumna moved into the little storefront.\nA famous Sanskrit professor, in his cubbyhole within the Widener Library, gave half an hour to hearing from Satsvarūpa about the swami and talking to him about theVedas.But the professor was unable to sign a letter requesting that the swami come to America.\nFinally, after several days at Harvard, Satsvarūpa managed to reserve a hall in a fraternity house for a single evening in November. The most difficult part was to persuade the house clerk to type a letter on the fraternity’s letterhead acknowledging that Swami Bhaktivedanta would lecture at the hall for one night in November. Although it was only a tiny victory, Satsvarūpa was pleased nevertheless. He sent the “Harvard” letter to Swamiji, who gratefully acknowledged it but added that an appointment as lecturer would have been better.\nNovember came, and Swamiji was still in India. So Satsvarūpa, Pradyumna, and Jadurāṇī attended the engagement themselves, handling lively debates with the students. TheHarvard Crimsonprinted a picture of the devotees, describing them as prophets. Śrīla Prabhupāda said he liked that in his absence his disciples were acting as prophets of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nOne night about two weeks before Prabhupāda left India for San Francisco, Satsvarūpa dreamed that Swamiji had already come to Boston. When he wrote Prabhupāda about this, Prabhupāda replied,\nOn December 14, 1967, Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived in San Francisco. The next day a devotee there phoned the devotees in Boston and told them details of Swamiji’s arrival. He said he might even be able to arrange for Swamiji to speak to them on the phone; at least he would try.\nThen one night the phone rang in the Boston storefront … and it was Swamiji! Jadurāṇī, who answered, said she had heard that Swamiji had looked very healthy at the airport and that he had been walking quickly and was tanned from the sun. When Prabhupāda mentioned that he had traveled all the way from India by himself, Jadurāṇī corrected, “But Kṛṣṇa was with you.” Satsvarūpa was next. “Swamiji,” he began, “we miss you very much.” And Prabhupāda replied, “Yes, and I am hearing you also.” Then Pradyumna spoke to Prabhupāda, explaining how he was trying to advertiseŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nAfterwards, each devotee related to the others what Swamiji had said. Each admitted to having said at least one very foolish thing to Swamiji; but they agreed that everything Swamiji had said had been wonderful. Satsvarūpa’s and Pradyumna’s happiness became so great that they couldn’t restrain themselves from rolling on the floor.\nOn the phone Prabhupāda had said that when he had left America he had had very little hope of returning. But Kṛṣṇa had informed him that he was not going to die immediately, so he had returned. He had said that he was getting inspiration in Kṛṣṇa consciousness from his own disciples, whom he considered to be “good souls.”\nPrabhupāda later wrote the Boston devotees from San Francisco.\nHe told them that although they were only three devotees, they should each work for three hundred. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, Prabhupāda explained, is never tired of working. Prabhupāda saw this as a symptom of spiritual advancement in his disciples, many of whom never tired of devotional service and always wanted to be overloaded with more and more work.\nSince Jadurāṇī didn’t have much art training, her first paintings had been crude, and Prabhupāda had sometimes laughed to see a picture’s defects. But he had been pleased with Jadurāṇī, who chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa while she worked and executed each painting just according to his instructions. If she stayed absorbed in painting, Prabhupāda said, then wherever she lived would be as good as Vṛndāvana.\nPrabhupāda wrote to Jadurāṇī, asking her to gather other female disciples interested in art, form an art department, and flood the world with paintings of Kṛṣṇa. The paintings, he said, were like windows to the spiritual world. He instructed her in many of the details of painting.\nIn depicting the fight between the boar incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa and the demon Hiraṇyākṣa, Prabhupāda gave specific instructions.\nEager to improve her art, Jadurāṇī began studying the great masters. But when she painted Nārada Muni after the style of Raphael, Prabhupāda said that Nārada looked too sensuous. He said he preferred her first painting of Nārada, although it had not been much more than a stick figure, because she had carefully tried to follow a print he had given her. Seeing the new sensuous Nārada and hearing of Jadurāṇī’s plans to study art and sell her paintings, Prabhupāda replied critically.\nJadurāṇī became despondent. Feeling like a fool and a deviant disciple, she wrote Prabhupāda only a brief reply. For several days she moped, considering her situation hopeless. Then she received another letter.\nTaking heart, Jadurāṇī continued to turn out more new paintings until there was scarcely room enough in the storefront to hang another.\nPrabhupāda was pleased with Pradyumna’s work, and this inspired Pradyumna to work more and more. But when Pradyumna sent a list of books he wanted to read to Prabhupāda for his approval, Prabhupāda, although interested in Pradyumna’s scholarship, warned him of the dangers.\nWhen Prabhupāda noticed spelling errors in the Sanskrit words inBack to Godheadmagazine, he asked that Pradyumna standardize the Sanskrit transliterations. Pradyumna had the aptitude, and Prabhupāda hoped he would become a successful scholar.\nSatsvarūpa’s special assignment was typing and editing Prabhupāda’sŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamdictations. Prabhupāda had first given Satsvarūpa this assignment in New York in 1966, and Satsvarūpa had continued when Prabhupāda had gone to San Francisco early in 1967. Later that same year, when Prabhupāda fell ill and stopped dictating, there had been no more tapes for Satsvarūpa to type. But as soon as Prabhupāda had returned from India, he had again begun translatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.He had written Satsvarūpa in Boston, asking him to rent a dictating machine: “As soon as you let me know that you have one dictaphone there, I will send you the tapes regularly.”\nBy the end of December the tapes had begun arriving at the Boston temple – plastic reels, Grundig dictation tapes, wrapped in a simple business envelope, stapled and addressed in Swamiji’s own hand. First they had come at the rate of one a week, then more quickly – two or three a week. Satsvarūpa had set aside the early morning hours for typing, before going to work, even before the others had risen from bed. He would sit on the kitchen floor listening to Prabhupāda’s voice through earphones and typing. “This is better than getting a letter,” he would think. It was Swamiji himself teaching the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nSatsvarūpa became so attached to his service that his whole existence began to revolve around it. He would feel a pang of love for every U.S. mailman he saw in the city, because it was the mailmen who delivered Swamiji’s tapes.\nAlthough Satsvarūpa considered himself expert in hearing Swamiji’s voice, on one tape there was one word he couldn’t understand. Prabhupāda was describing the demon Hiraṇyākṣa’s birth from Diti, and to Satsvarūpa it sounded like “by theporesof the pregnancy of Diti, the whole universe went dark.” How could Diti’s pregnancy havepores?Prabhupāda wrote back that it was “force,” not “pores.” Prabhupāda wrote, “The best thing will be as soon as you typewrite the tapes send me one copy after editing. I will keep one copy with me, you keep one copy with you.”\nSometimes, while riding on the bus to work, Satsvarūpa would fall asleep and dream of hearing Swamiji’s voice in his ears and himself rapidly typing. It was a very personal service. Prabhupāda had nine tapes, and he wanted to keep track of how many were with Satsvarūpa and how many were on their way back to him. “I have sent one tape this morning,” Prabhupāda wrote. “Probably you are getting it tomorrow. So far I received your edited copy ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and it is nicely done.”\nSince the arrival of winter’s snow and ice in Boston, not many people had been coming by the storefront in the evenings. And the devotees were content to stay indoors, working at their respective tasks. Each of them was satisfied that his engagement was perfect.\nPrabhupāda had fixed the date of his arrival in Boston for May 1, and he asked Satsvarūpa to begin arranging lectures for him in Boston’s many universities. When the devotees sent Prabhupāda a few photographs of the storefront interior, he wrote back, “It gives me a nice idea.” Although the photos showed only a small empty room with an unfinished altar, Prabhupāda had not been looking with the eyes of an interior decorator. Rather, his “nice idea” was that his disciples in Boston were engaging in Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the best of their ability. The important thing was that they were serving Kṛṣṇa. By adding Kṛṣṇa consciousness, anything material could become valuable.\nWhen Pradyumna had to enter the hospital for a hernia operation, Satsvarūpa didn’t know how they would pay for it. Pradyumna’s parents had refused. Having no one else to turn to, Satsvarūpa wrote Prabhupāda, asking him if he could pay the bill. Just as a dependent child, fearful of the world, turns always to his protective parents, Satsvarūpa had faith that Swamiji knew everything and could decide everything. And besides, no one else cared about Pradyumna or how the Boston center for Kṛṣṇa consciousness would pay a five-hundred-dollar hospital bill. Satsvarūpa concluded that if Swamiji thought it wrong for him to ask for the money, then he would tell them that also.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda considered the hospital bill a botheration. Why should he have to worry about every item of business in ten different centers around the world? Although he assured Satsvarūpa that if necessary he would send the money for Pradyumna’s bill, he suggested that his disciples form a governing board to manage such problems. His growing institution had to be properly managed – and not entirely by him. He should be left to carry on the duties proper for the spiritual master, not that he should have to be simultaneously treasurer, chairman, troubleshooter, and counselor for each problem of each devotee in each center. And yet that was happening as he accepted more disciples. They were turning to him for everything: medical advice, marriage counseling, financial assistance, as well as transcendental knowledge. Prabhupāda said it gave him a headache.\nAfter Pradyumna’s successful surgery, Prabhupāda wrote, congratulating him.\nAs the time grew nearer for Prabhupāda’s arrival, Satsvarūpa, Pradyumna, and Jadurāṇī arranged for his living accommodation. When they wrote to Prabhupāda in New York candidly telling him what they had and asking if it was good enough, he replied that he didn’t mind walking the nine blocks from the storefront to the house as long as there were no hills. And he didn’t mind how many devotees stayed with him at the apartment, but he must have a separate, silent place. As for college lecture engagements, he said whether they were big or small, he was always “prepared to serve.” “Probably you are making fine arrangements,” he wrote. “Many will come to the temple to hear me. So in that case I must come.”\nMay 1, 1968The first devotee to meet Prabhupāda in Boston was Jadurāṇī, walking forward at the airport with a flower garland for her spiritual master. As they rode in the taxi together back to the temple, Prabhupāda asked Jadurāṇī about her painting. She complained that in preparing for his visit she had had to sew material for the altar, put up curtains, and make posters and post them all over the city – because the men in the temple were working at their office jobs. Consequently, she hadn’t been able to do her real service of painting. “Don’t worry,” Prabhupāda said, “I won’t stay long.”\nThe taxi stopped at Prabhupāda’s house on Chester Street. It was a two-story building, the first floor being Prabhupāda’s apartment. Upstairs were some Boston University students, who had agreed to play their music softly while the swami was visiting; their motorcycles were parked beside the house. Walking slowly up the wooden stairs and across the front porch, Prabhupāda entered his apartment. Prabhupāda found Satsvarūpa in the kitchen, standing over the stove, cooking. Satsvarūpa offered obeisances and immediately returned to his cooking, apologizing that he hadn’t been able to meet Swamiji at the airport. He had three burners going at once, and he appeared both very happy and very nervous.\n“What are you cooking?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“Sweetrice,halavā, purīs,and a vegetable,” Satsvarūpa replied, stirring the sweet rice and watching over the other preparations as he spoke. It was more like the Sunday feast than Swamiji’s daily fare of rice,dāl,andcapātīs.But these rich dishes were all Satsvarūpa knew how to cook.\nPrabhupāda smiled. Looking around the kitchen, he saw against the window a poster: “The Spiritual Master of the Holy Name is Coming to Boston.” It was a photo of Swamiji with a list of speaking engagements at various universities. As Prabhupāda read it his face brightened. “You have given me a full month’s engagement!” he said. Then he walked leisurely out of the kitchen, leaving Satsvarūpa anxiously trying to hurry lunch without burning anything.\nPrabhupāda entered his room and took a seat at the low desk, leaning his back against the pillow. “Why don’t you take some rest now?” Jadurāṇī suggested.\n“I rested on the plane,” Prabhupāda replied.\n“Well,” Jadurāṇī persisted, “you could rest some more.”\nPrabhupāda turned his head slightly away from her and said softly, “I am not meant for resting all day and night.”\nPrabhupāda asked to see Satsvarūpa. Gaurasundara went to fetch him but returned saying that Satsvarūpa couldn’t come; he was too busy cooking.\nWhen Prabhupāda’s lunch finally arrived, the devotees in his room excused themselves and left Prabhupāda alone. Most of the devotees – including several guests and visitors from New York – having stayed up all night preparing Swamiji’s apartment, fell asleep on the floor in various rooms throughout the apartment. Prabhupāda could hear their snoring, and after finishing his lunch he went out and looked from room to room without waking anyone. In the living room, he sat down on the couch, and soon the devotees awoke and joined him.\nPrabhupāda began talking about Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana. “Vṛndāvana,” he said, “is the kingdom of Rādhārāṇī. In Vṛndāvana, if someone wanted to visit me” – he looked behind him down the long hallway toward the door at the rear of the apartment – “they would call ‘JayaRādhe!’ ” Prabhupāda called out loudly, as if he were a visitor at the back door. “And I would call back” – he looked again toward the rear door – “ ‘JayaRādhe!’ Kṛṣṇa is very strict, and Rādhā is very nice. A woman, unless she is unnatural, is very soft-hearted and very kindhearted. And Rādhārāṇī is not unnatural.”\nLater Jadurāṇī apologized to Swamiji for foolishly complaining to him in the car. He had said to her, “Don’t worry, I won’t stay long,” but actually she wanted him to stay permanently. She didn’t want him to think that his presence was an inconvenience. She had complained because she was in anxiety about neglecting the service that Prabhupāda had directly given to her. Whenever Satsvarūpa gave her service to do other than painting, she would become confused about the priority. Prabhupāda heard her patiently, clearly understanding the heart of her inquiry. “The direct order of the spiritual master,” he said, “is the most important thing to do, except in an emergency.”\nAt the entranceway to one of the main buildings was a large bronze statue of a dog, a husky, Northeastern’s mascot. Prabhupāda became amused. Some of the older disciples knew that Swamiji was sarcastically humorous about Americans’ attachment to their dogs. Because now people have no interest in God, he would say, therefore they have become devoted to dog. Instead of worshiping G-O-D, materialistic people had become enamored with D-O-G and considered him man’s best friend. Some of Prabhupāda’s disciples had told him strange stories of how Americans pampered their dogs so much that dogs sometimes sit at the dinner table with their masters or receive their master’s property through the master’s will. Pausing silently, regarding the almost deified form of the dog, Prabhupāda scored an unspoken criticism of Western values.\nAbout two hundred students and a few teachers crowded into the pews of the small chapel. While Prabhupāda sat cross-legged on a cloth-covered table, Satsvarūpa led thekīrtana,playing on a one-headed drum.\nAfter thekīrtana,Prabhupāda leaned forward to the microphone: “Thank you for giving me this opportunity to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And he began to lecture about the three aspects of the Absolute Truth, which he compared to the three aspects of the sun: the sunshine, the sun globe, and the sun-god. Although the Absolute Truth is one, some persons see Him as impersonal, all-pervading light; some see Him as the localized Supersoul in the heart of all beings; and some see Him as Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Prabhupāda’s talk was very philosophical.\nDigressing, Prabhupāda began talking more about the sun. He said that on the sun there was a presiding deity, Vivasvān. “You can’t disbelieve it,” Prabhupāda said. And he quoted theMahābhāratathat on the sun are living entities with bodies of fire. Just as certain living entities have bodies adapted to living in water, so there are living entities that live in fire.\nThe big noonday crowd listened politely. Prabhupāda concluded his half-hour lecture by explaining God, the Supreme Being, as the origin of the material (external) and spiritual (internal) energies. We living entities, although spiritual, have marginal position; all of us in this material world are covered by the external energy. The prayer of “Hare Kṛṣṇa” means, “O my dear Lord, I am Your part and parcel eternally, but some way or other I have fallen in this ignorance of material energy. Kindly lift me up to the spiritual energy.”\nAlthough Prabhupāda invited the audience to stay afterward and speak with his disciples, when the bell rang, the lecture abruptly ended, and most of the students immediately left the chapel to make room for the next group of students. It was the academic factory; class was over, and Swamiji and his followers should now leave.\nAs Prabhupāda was walking down the hall, the wife of one of the college administrators joined him, walking at his side and chatting pleasantly and effusively, assuring him that everyone at the university was very glad he had come. She walked with him to the door and then shook his hand. Turning to Satsvarūpa, she exclaimed that everything had gone beautifully, that Swamiji had spoken wonderfully, and that she would send the hundred-dollar honorarium in the mail. Feeling excited and successful, the devotees accompanied Prabhupāda to the car. Riding back to his house, Prabhupāda agreed it had been a successful engagement.\nThe Boston University engagement in spacious Marsh Chapel was poorly attended. Despite thousands of students riding the trolleys and going in and out of the luncheonettes and big gray buildings that lined both sides of Commonwealth Avenue for blocks, only half a dozen came to Marsh Chapel to hear Swamiji. The devotees, pained and embarrassed, criticized Satsvarūpa for the turnout. Even the onstage arrangements were poor, with Prabhupāda seated on a too-high, rickety table.\nYet without hesitation, Prabhupāda held a full program, beginning with akīrtanathat lasted almost an hour. He requested Brahmānanda, visiting from New York, to give an introductory speech. Then Prabhupāda spoke, his voice reverberating over the sound system throughout the cavernous empty chapel.\nAfter the lecture, Prabhupāda called for questions. A boy, standing at his seat and shouting to make himself heard, asked, “Is thisadvaitaphilosophy?” A challenge. The devotees could tell that this student had come with his own ideas aboutyogaand“advaita.”\n“Do you know what isadvaitaphilosophy?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“All is One,” the boy replied. “Just as the rivers enter into the ocean, so we all enter into the Ultimate Oneness.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda replied that although the river goes to the ocean, its place in the ocean is not permanent. Again that water evaporates into the sky, forms clouds, and falls back onto the land. To argue that spiritually everything becomes one as the rivers go to the ocean, then the boy would have to accept the actual conclusion: the water again falls back onto the land. Similarly, those spirit souls who try to merge into the Absolute must again fall back into the material world. Prabhupāda thoroughly defeated the impersonal notion of oneness. The boy sat down silent. There were no other questions.\nTalking with his disciples afterwards, Prabhupāda said sarcastically, “People today do not even know how to ask a good question. These impersonalists always ask the same hackneyed question about the river going into the ocean.”\nOn the way back to the temple, some of the devotees continued to grumble about Swamiji’s having to go to an engagement with such a poor turnout. Brahmānanda warned Satsvarūpa that the next engagement had better not be like this one.\nAlthough it was time for the lecture to begin, the devotees had still not arrived with the paraphernalia. There was no flower garland for Prabhupāda, no painting of Kṛṣṇa, and no sign with themahā-mantra.The audience waited.\nIn anxiety, Satsvarūpa asked Prabhupāda, “Can you begin without the painting?” Looking at the large, momentous gathering, Śrīla Prabhupāda said simply, “Painting is not important.” He sat on the plain wooden platform and, since the musical instruments had not arrived, asked one of the devotees to play the Hare Kṛṣṇa album. Prabhupāda sat clapping his hands in time and listening.\nPrabhupāda spoke boldly, challenging the very concepts underlying MIT. Where in this big university, he asked, is a department for studying the technology of the soul, for understanding that principle which distinguishes a living body from a dead body, that principle which when present in the body gives life and when absent brings death? Where is the science to study this all-important principle of life? Although scientists consider life to be merely chemicals or electric impulses, he argued, still they are unable to assemble the chemicals and produce life. Why? There is no department in this university for answering this question, and therefore people are in ignorance. They don’t know the self or the next life or the purpose of human life beyond animal activities. This science, however, is taught in theBhagavad-gītā.\nAfter the lecture there were many questions. “What is the symbolism,” one student asked, “of that object behind you on the stage?” Prabhupāda turned and beheld a bare U-shaped metal stand – compliments of the janitor – for holding the painting of Kṛṣṇa that never arrived.\n“This?” Prabhupāda frowned. “I do not know what this is. This is some kind of technological symbol.”\nAnother student asked, “Why do you wear that marking on your forehead?”\n“Why doyouwear that necktie around your neck?” Prabhupāda snapped back, annoyed with the question. The student sat down, looking at his necktie, and Prabhupāda explained to him that questions about why people dress a certain way are trivial, especially considering the gravity of the present subject matter.\nWhen the question-and-answer period ended, Satsvarūpa stood and briefly addressed the students, inviting them to attend other college lectures by Śrīla Prabhupāda or to come hear him at the temple. “Wherever a saintly person goes,” Satsvarūpa said, “becomes atīrtha,or holy place. And now for the month of May, Boston is atīrtha,so please take advantage of it.”\nAs Śrīla Prabhupāda was leaving with his disciples, a group of Indian faculty members and students came and stood around him, speaking rapidly, challenging him. One student, espousing the philosophy of monism, asserted that the highest expression of the Absolute Truth was that “All is One.” Prabhupāda tried to make him understand that simply oneness was a rudimentary idea, because from that “one” come so many variegated manifestations. But the man would not accept defeat, and Prabhupāda became excited arguing with him. Taking the man by the shirt collar, Prabhupāda shouted, “You say everything is one! But is this cotton shirt the same as a cotton ball? Why don’t you wear a cotton ball instead of this shirt?”\nThe Indian technologists surrounded Prabhupāda, raising their voices and arguing, while Prabhupāda’s disciples looked on anxiously. Govinda dāsī warned the devotees about Swamiji’s health, and Brahmānanda and the others smoldered at the offensive Indians. This wasn’t the way to speak with asādhu.\nMeanwhile, a devotee reported that Prabhupāda’s car had broken down, and someone ran out into the street to get a taxi. The arguing continued. When a taxi finally arrived, a few disciples pushed through the arguers, insisting, “Swamiji, please, your taxi is waiting. It can’t wait any longer. You have to go.” And they disengaged their spiritual master from the mass of arguing technologists. Prabhupāda considered the evening a success.\nPrabhupāda, arriving half an hour later than scheduled, led the audience inkīrtanaand began his talk. He praised the Harvard students as fortunate, citing that according to Vedic literature, aristocratic birth, good education, beauty, and wealth are the four chief material opulences. Compared to others in the world, he said, the students at Harvard had all these opulences. If, however, they couldincreasetheir good fortune by adding Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then that would be their perfection. For example, gold is certainly very valuable. But if gold were to have a pleasant fragrance, then it would be even more valuable. Similarly, if these materially fortunate persons could add the spiritual fortune of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to their life, then that life would be successful.\nAfter Prabhupāda’s talk, Mr. Matthews thanked him for his discourse on Hindu philosophy. But immediately Prabhupāda interrupted: “Actually, we are not Hindu.” And Prabhupāda explained the universality of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nAs the meeting broke, some interested students came forward for more discussion with Swamiji. One Sanskrit student asked, “How can abrahmacārībe expected to understand theGīta-govinda,since it deals in so many intricacies of man-woman relationships and love affairs?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda replied,“Onlyabrahmacārīcan understandGīta-govinda,because it is not about mundane sexuality. It is the highest spiritual technology of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.”\nPrabhupāda was especially pleased about his Harvard lecture. The next morning Satsvarūpa went to see him with a check for $125 from Harvard. “That was a very good meeting last night,” Prabhupāda said.\nIt seemed to the devotees accompanying Prabhupāda from one speaking engagement to another thattheywere the real audience, the ones to whom Prabhupāda was speaking. It was for them that he had come to Boston, more than for the two hundred students who sat in the chapel at Northeastern until the bell rang, or the technologists in the lounge at MIT who left after the lecture for the movies and the bars. Prabhupāda was setting the example of how to preach. It was for them – the ones who would have to carry on the mission in his absence.\nFrom morning until night, Prabhupāda spoke about Kṛṣṇa. Althoughyogīssometimes take a vow of silence to avoid useless, frivolous talk, he said, one who knows Kṛṣṇa wants to speak twenty-four hours a day. “When you love God, you want to tell others about Him. And automatically you write volumes and volumes of books.”\nOf course, many times in the day Prabhupāda was actually silent, alone in his room. But that “silence” was also Kṛṣṇa conscious. Sometimes Govinda dāsī would peek in and find him reading the SanskritBhāgavatamcommentaries, chanting on his beads, or dozing briefly at his desk after lunch. Sometimes he would sing verses fromCaitanya-caritāmṛtaor walk around the apartment with his hand in his bead bag, chanting to himself and observing his assistants.\nGovinda dāsī:In Boston Swamiji would sing for hours fromCaitanya-caritāmṛtaorŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam–just singing with the most feeling all by himself in his room. And I would peek in the keyhole to see how he was. Sometimes I would go in and check on him when he would pause. I would try not to disturb him – “Just checking.” I would just go in to see if he needed anything. Sometimes I would peek in and simply think, “Who is he? Nobody knows who he really is or where he really came from or how great he really is.” Especially in Boston I began to feel very strongly that he was such a great personality and that I was viewing only a very, very minute glimpse of him, and that actually much, much more was going on than I could realize.\nA devotee might go in to ask Swamiji what he wanted for lunch or to check on his travel schedule or to get advice on some business item, but the talk would almost invariably turn to Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy once matters at hand had been dealt with. What Swamiji wanted for lunch might bring him to talk about what Kṛṣṇa liked for lunch, or how great devotees went without eating, or how the modern-day civilization was demoniac for killing helpless cows. And whoever entered Prabhupāda’s room might find himself being pressed to argue against the existence of God and then be defeated by Prabhupāda. Or Prabhupāda might start talking – even to a disciple who came to replace a burned-out bulb – about how he wanted to one day introduce the Kṛṣṇa conscious social order,varṇāśrama-dharma,all over the world.\nSometimes a lone devotee sitting with Prabhupāda as he spoke so profoundly would feel guilty: “If instead of talking just to me he were translating his books, then everyone could benefit. I shouldn’t be taking up his time in this way.” Once Jadurāṇī expressed the sentiment, “Swamiji, maybe you should save your strength for translating.”\n“If youlovesomeone,” Prabhupāda replied, raising his head back while looking at Jadurāṇī, “you like to hear him speak.”\nMore often, however, once a devotee got into Prabhupāda’s room he wouldn’t leave until Govinda dāsī came in, dropping broad hints or pointing to her watch and signalling from the doorway. In fact, the devotees took up so much of Prabhupāda’s time that Gaurasundara and Govinda dāsī complained to Satsvarūpa. Swamiji was being disturbed more in Boston than he had been in any other place, they said, and he was getting very little translating done. Alarmed that Boston was becoming inconvenient for Swamiji, Satsvarūpa agreed to restrict devotees from seeing Prabhupāda in his room. He informed the devotees that they could accompany Prabhupāda on his walk, but that they should not follow him back to his house.\nSatsvarūpa:Following my instruction the next morning everyone stopped at the bottom of the porch; Swamiji alone walked up the steps to his house. When he got to the top step, he turned around to see us all standing there, and he waved to us, “Come on.” Everyone immediately ran up the stairs and joined him in his room.\nFeeling guilty that we were taking up his time, I made an attempt to terminate the discussion in his room. Bowing my head to the floor in a gesture of leaving, I announced to Śrīla Prabhupāda, “We will leave you now and let you do your work.” But Swamiji checked me as presumptuous. “You think I am not working now? Do you think this is not work?” He said, “You do not know what work is. This is also work.” And he talked on.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda spoke to eradicate the ignorance of whoever would hear him – whether a crowd of thousands or a single disciple in his room. Although he was especially interested in addressing the younger generation – the older was too biased – the number of listeners wasn’t important. After the first meeting in the temple, when the attendance had dropped, Prabhupāda had said that it didn’t mean he should stop speaking. He gave the example of a university in Calcutta that had kept classes open although only two students had enrolled in one course and only one student in another. And this, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, should certainly be the standard with transcendental education; if only one person learned it, he could do good to many others.\nEarly one morning as Śrīla Prabhupāda walked through the neighborhood of Allston with Satsvarūpa and Gaurasundara, Satsvarūpa mentioned that a famous swami had recently given a talk at Arlington Street Church, where Prabhupāda was also scheduled to speak. “What does he say?” Prabhupāda asked. Satsvarūpa said that he had heard that the swami had said he was God. Immediately Prabhupāda began to argue, destroying the swami’s alleged claim to be God.\n“They say they are God and the dog is God,” Prabhupāda began. As he spoke, Satsvarūpa and Gaurasundara walked beside him, sometimes holding back a low tree branch or watching on Prabhupāda’s behalf for traffic at the street crossings. But mostly they were concentrating on Prabhupāda’s words. Satsvarūpa could understand that Swamiji was expending energy just to instruct him, to equip him to defeat such arguments. He tried to remember every word exactly as Swamiji was speaking it.\n“If everyone is God,” Prabhupāda continued, “then why is God worshiped all over the world in temples and churches, and why are these ‘Gods’ shoe-kicking each other? Do they know what God is that they say they are God? Do they have an idea of what God is? God is the controller. Are they controlling the universe? Ask them these questions. Are they omnipotent and omniscient? These are qualities of God. If you are God, do you know what I am thinking? – because God is all-knowing. They should not be allowed to say these things. They should be curbed with these questions.”\nPrabhupāda punctuated his talk by sudden stops. He was angry. It was as if he were charging his disciples for allowing this nonsense “I am God” talk to go on unchecked. Why didn’t they stop these rascals? He looked at them with eyes flashing. Were they meeting the challenges of the atheists? Theyshouldbe. They should be fighting. And these were the arguments they should use. They shouldn’t doubt.\n“We understand God is vast,” Prabhupāda continued. “We are similar to Him in quality, but we are infinitesimal. If they are God, then how is it they have come to this doggish state? You may be God, but for the present moment they are not God. They will admit that for the present moment they are not God, but that they will become God in the future. But what kind of God is this? And how have they fallen under illusion? That means illusion is stronger than God – that they have come under illusion. So the God then ismāyā,or not God. They may be God, but they are not theparaṁ brahman,the supreme God. We have the definition of God – that He is all-powerful. This swami is not all-powerful. If some poor fellow came to him on the street, he could not stop from getting a beating. And if he got a toothache, he would be ruined as God. God is all-wealthy. This swami is begging for money, and he is God? God is all-knowing. They are not even intelligent. To surrender to Kṛṣṇa is intelligent. They are kicking each other, and they are fallen in the conditioned state. And they say they are God! These questions should be put to them. They cannot answer them.”\nPrabhupāda continued his walk through a neighborhood of automobile showrooms, hamburger luncheonettes not yet opened, and bus stops crowded with workers who stared at the elderly Swami passing with his young followers.\n“The devotees,” Prabhupāda said, “are more interested in talking about Kṛṣṇa and in chanting His name than in arguing. But because so many godless parties come forward and challenge, a Vaiṣṇava must be able to argue on the basis ofśāstraand sound logic.”\nMr. Matthews, the Harvard graduate student of Vaiṣṇavism, visited Prabhupāda at his apartment one evening. Prabhupāda explained that if one is inquisitive not about temporary things but about the Absolute, then he must go to aguru.Mr. Matthews asked whethersannyāsawas necessary.\nAccording toBhagavad-gītā,Prabhupāda replied, asannyāsīis one who has given everything to the service of Kṛṣṇa. The dress and social standing are not important. While Mr. Matthews posed intricate questions about the contemporary situation of spiritual masters in India, Śrīla Prabhupāda explained that a true spiritual master must be in disciplic succession and must strictly follow the regulative principles of Vaiṣṇava behavior. The current family custom in India of having a familyguruwas foolishness. Theguruwas not a family commodity or a pet.\nMr. Matthews was trying to make the point that Prabhupāda was not the only spiritual master and that there were many pure devotees in places like Vṛndāvana who did not necessarily go out for preaching but who preached to whoever came to them.\n“Lord Caitanya,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “ordered to go out and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Not that I stay in Vṛndāvana, and if anyone comes to me, I will teach. We must go out and go to them. Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered like that. He is the authority. We don’t serve this or that. We serve Kṛṣṇa and nothing else: ‘I am a servant of Kṛṣṇa.’ And the best position for preaching issannyāsa,because he doesn’t have to send money to his family or go back to his wife at a certain hour. But everything is for Kṛṣṇa. This is the attractive background for preaching. The dress is not important.”\nMr. Matthews disagreed that a spiritual master had to be asannyāsīor a renounced preacher. After about an hour, Mr. Matthews checked his watch and became alarmed: “Oh, my goodness. It’s late. I am having guests over, and my wife is cooking a dinner for them. I have to go.”\n“You see?” Prabhupāda said. “This proves my point.”\nLate in May, Prabhupāda held a public lecture at the Arlington Street Church, a well-known landmark in the heart of downtown Boston. With many respectable-looking older people as well as young people in the audience, the meeting was well attended. Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke onyogaas Lord Kṛṣṇa explains it inBhagavad-gītā.Prabhupāda emphasized that Kṛṣṇa chose Arjuna as the recipient of the knowledge ofyoga.\nWhy Arjuna? Arjuna, Śrīla Prabhupāda explained, wasn’t asannyāsī,he was a family man. He wasn’t a scholar. And so many big scholars were present at the time. He wasn’t ahaṭha-yogīor even abrāhmaṇa.So why was he picked? Prabhupāda shouted into the microphone: “Bhakto ’si me!…Bhakto ’si me sakhā ceti.Because you are Mydevotee!”\nAfterward, Prabhupāda asked for questions.\n“There are different levels ofyoga,” someone asked, “so you can take anyyogaand then go further up?”\n“Step by step you can go up – that is your option. Butbhakti-yogais to take the life immediately. ‘One who is thinking always of Me within his heart and is engaged in My service with faith and devotion – he is a first-classyogīof allyogīs.’ Yogameans to contact the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If by some process you can at once contact, that is first class. Why not try it? Try chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Try this process.”\n“Does devotion come first and then awareness, or awareness first?”\nPrabhupāda: “First devotion, then awareness. If you do not labor for passing exam, how you can pass? The primary rule is to chant. Just see. We have a little faith in the beginning, a little respect. We think, ‘Let me see what is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness.’ If we think it is nice, then we come again and associate. These boys did not accept in the beginning, but they came and advanced. For others, it is hackneyed. But these boys have become purified and they have a taste. They cannot give it up. It is ecstasy. So there is gradual process of love of God.”\nThe next morning three disciples of Swami Satchidananda visited Śrīla Prabhupāda. Accompanying him on his morning walk, they asked many questions.\nThey were young men like Prabhupāda’s disciples. One of them was a hairdresser named Bob. “If they are already disciples of aguru,” Satsvarūpa thought, “then why are they so curious about anotherguru’sprocess?”\nBob asked, “Don’t you need to practicehaṭha-yogain order to purify the body so that eventually you can purify the higher self within?”\n“Cleanse the mind and the intelligence,” Prabhupāda replied, “and the body is automatically cleansed.Haṭha-yogais for those in the gross bodily concept of life. In the second chapter ofBhagavad-gītā,Kṛṣṇa says that a wise man doesn’t place much importance on the body. Thehaṭha-yogī’smain concentration is this body. By bodily exercise he wants to have Kṛṣṇa’s love. If this were possible, all wrestlers and athletes would have achieved Kṛṣṇa’s love. Lord Caitanya’s program of chanting begins with the cleansing of the mind, and this takes care of cleansing the body.”\nYogastudent: “What about sex desire? I want the spiritual, but I have such a strong desire for sex.”\nPrabhupāda: “Haṭha-yogais also for controlling sex desire. If you have such desire, you are making no progress.”\nYogastudent: “How does a devotee of Kṛṣṇa control sex desire?”\nPrabhupāda: “Automatically. Kṛṣṇa is so beautiful. We are accustomed to this habit for a very long time. Become sincere, and Kṛṣṇa will protect you.”\nYogastudent: “Sometimes I have a sex urge …”\nPrabhupāda: “What?You? Everybody! In birds, beasts, demigods – the binding force is sex. The material life means sex desire. Free from sex desire means advancing in spiritual desire. If you have a strong sex desire, pray to Kṛṣṇa. Know that this is the attack ofmāyā.Pray, andmāyāwill go away. You cannot fight withmāyāwith your own energy.Māyāis presenting herself more beautiful than Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa is more beautiful.”\nYogastudent: “How soon before I could get initiated by you?”\nPrabhupāda: “The first initiation is to understand the philosophy. Actually, one should be initiated after hearing for one year.”\nYogastudent: “How can you tell a Kṛṣṇa conscious holy man from an ordinary holy man?”\nPrabhupāda: “He is always thinking about Kṛṣṇa. Not even a moment without thinking about Kṛṣṇa.”\nYogastudent: “Canmāyāhave a hold on a man who’s dedicated to selflessness, even if he doesn’t take to Kṛṣṇa?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes,māyāis always holding you. Unless you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, some waymāyāhas you. God says, ‘Here I am.’ But you say God is somewhere else. You are searching after God, and you cannot see when He comes before you. Then you are inmāyā.Why don’t you accept Kṛṣṇa as God?”\nYogastudent: “What is the nature of a devotee? Is he always in ecstasy?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, always in ecstasy. He’s always feeling separation: ‘I could not serve Kṛṣṇa.’ This is nice.”\nYogastudent: “Does it actually say anywhere in the scriptures that you have to come back to the material world if you don’t worship Kṛṣṇa? Does it actually say it?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, yes:āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho ’nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ.‘Byneglecting Your lotus feet he has to come down again.’ ‘Feet’ means He is a person.”\nTheseyogastudents were attracted to Prabhupāda’s teachings. They began to act like his followers, attending hiskīrtanasand lectures, offering obeisances to him.\nOne day after a morning walk, Prabhupāda, accompanied by some of his disciples and theyogastudents, returned to his room. When Prabhupāda noticed that his secretary, Gaurasundara, was absent, he called for him. Gaurasundara came to the door, and Prabhupāda asked why he was not attending the talk. He was busy working in another room, Gaurasundara explained. “Do you think that these talks I give are just for new men?” Prabhupāda asked angrily. “Youdon’t have to hear? Do you think that you are so advanced? This is not good. You should always hear when your spiritual master speaks.”\nAfter several days, thehaṭha-yogastudents stopped coming. “They appeared so devoted,” Prabhupāda remarked casually. “That one boy was even helping me with my shoes.”\nPrabhupāda continued attending the storefront three nights a week. Wearing his swami cap, with its hanging straps, he looked like a rugged aviator. Entering the room, he would look around to see who was there, walk forward to the altar, offer his obeisances to the picture of Kṛṣṇa, and ascend to the raised platform to speak.\nOne night, while Prabhupāda was down on his hands and knees before the altar, just about to rise up after offering obeisances, he began to carefully scrutinize a picture one of the devotees had recently placed on the altar. The picture showed a young woman handing baby Kṛṣṇa to His father Vasudeva; both Vasudeva and the young woman were standing in a river. The devotees didn’t know the meaning of the picture or who the woman was, so one of them asked Prabhupāda about it.\nWhile Prabhupāda and half a dozen devotees remained on the floor on their hands and knees, Prabhupāda told them the story. Kṛṣṇa’s father Vasudeva had been carrying Him across the Yamunā when Kṛṣṇa had fallen in. In great anxiety, Vasudeva had searched within the water for his son. The Yamunā River personified (the young woman in the picture) had then risen out of the water and handed Kṛṣṇa to Vasudeva, saying, “I just wanted to play with Him for a while.”\nOne night after his lecture, while Prabhupāda sat conversing with disciples, Govinda dāsī handed him an advertisement Rāya Rāma had designed forBack to Godheadmagazine. The ad featured several pictures of Prabhupāda and the headline “This Man Has Changed the History of the World.” The devotees were proud of the ad, which was supposed to be in accordance with the latest graphic and advertising trends. Prabhupāda, however, held the ad in his hand silently. Finally, someone asked him what he thought of it, and Prabhupāda replied, “This is not good. It is not considered respectful to call the spiritual master by the term ‘man.’ ” This shows the state of consciousness of the disciple, he explained. Frowning, he handed back the ad.\nSeveral times one evening, children screaming and rapping on the window panes interrupted Prabhupāda’s lecture. After several interruptions, Prabhupāda shook his head and said that these children had no training, which was the fault of modern society. A man in the audience objected: “But children are known as the divine folk.”\n“What is that?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“These children are supposed to be divine.”\nPrabhupāda looked at the man. “Supposedto be,” he said dryly. “That’s all right.”\nOne evening after the lecture, Prabhupāda toured the small storefront. One of the main features he noted was the abundance of paintings by Jadurāṇī, and he looked at each one with pleasure.\nWhen he went downstairs to the basement and saw the devotees’ austere living and bathing conditions, for which some people had criticized them, he was not disturbed. He inspected the oil burner and asked if it worked all right. There was little for Satsvarūpa to show him in the tiny building, so Prabhupāda saw everything in only a few minutes. Yet because it was Kṛṣṇa’s center and they were Kṛṣṇa’s devotees, Prabhupāda’s brief tour made everything seem important and worthwhile.\nIt came as a surprise to everyone when one day Prabhupāda said that he would be giving some of his disciplesbrāhmaṇa,or second, initiation; he would award the Gāyatrīmantraand sacred thread to those men who had been initiated for at least one year. The devotees wanted to know more about the initiation, and Prabhupāda said he would explain everything at the ceremony. The ceremony, he said, would be in the temple, and there should be a sacrificial fire just as at any other initiation. He invited Mr. Matthews from Harvard as the guest of honor.\nOn the day of the initiation, everyone crowded into the temple room around the mound of earth where the sacred fire would soon be blazing. The half a dozen male disciples whom Śrīla Prabhupāda had selected to receive brahminical initiation took their seats.\nPrabhupāda entered. Taking his seat on the pillow on the floor directly before the mound of earth, he began to explain how his spiritual master, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, had introduced brahminical initiation for disciples not born ofbrāhmaṇafamilies. He said the Vedic scriptures offered much evidence that by associating with pure devotees, anyone could become abrāhmaṇa.In fact, the scriptures said that if one born in abrāhmaṇafamily did not behave as abrāhmaṇa,then he should not be accepted as abrāhmaṇa.So it was in following his spiritual master and the Vedic scriptures that Śrīla Prabhupāda was now going to give brahminical initiation to his disciples.\nAddressing Mr. Matthews as “Professor Matthews,” Prabhupāda asked whether he had any questions about the procedure. Mr. Matthews laughed and said he was not a professor yet. He asked whether the Gāyatrīmantrawas more important than the Hare Kṛṣṇamantra.Prabhupāda replied that the Hare Kṛṣṇamantrawas sufficient in itself for delivering the disciple back to Godhead; nevertheless, the Gāyatrīmantrawould increase the Kṛṣṇa consciousness of the disciple.\nMr. Matthews: “Do these disciples take on any new vows, such as fasting?”\nPrabhupāda: “No, there is no new vow. As far as fasting is concerned, people take to fasting because generally they eat all nonsense all week. So for one day they stop eating in order to purify themselves. But the devotees are always eatingkṛṣṇa-prasādam,which is sanctified. So even by eating, they are fasting.”\nLater in the ceremony, the boys went, one by one, and sat beside Śrīla Prabhupāda, who placed a sacred white thread over their bare shoulders and chest and showed them how to count themantrason their fingers.\nWhile the sacrificial fire was blazing and the devotees were chantingmantrasand throwing grains in the flames, the landlord’s wife suddenly intruded. She was middle-aged, intoxicated, disheveled – a grotesque alcoholic tottering in the doorway. Striding into the room, she shouted, “God damn this house!” and then turned and left, slamming the door. Prabhupāda looked up innocently. “What did she say? Did she say that this is the house of God?”\n“She’s just drunk,” Satsvarūpa said.\nGovinda dāsī hadn’t gone to the initiation, excusing herself as ill. Although she hadn’t told Prabhupāda, she was upset that he wasn’t giving brahminical initiation to women. Disappointed, she had stayed at Swamiji’s apartment, crying. After an hour, however, she decided that by behaving so foolishly she was missing out on Prabhupāda’s talk. So she hurried out of the house and ran all the way to the temple, arriving near the end of the ceremony. As she entered, Prabhupāda looked up. “Oh,” he said, “I was just thinking, ‘Where is that girl?’ and Kṛṣṇa has sent.”\nAfter the ceremony Govinda dāsī conferred with Jadurāṇī, who also felt slighted. Prabhupāda could detect their mentality, although they didn’t openly voice their complaints. The next morning he told Gaurasundara and Govinda dāsī that he saw no harm in offering the Gayātrīmantrato women – but they could not receive the sacred thread. That very night, he held a separate ceremony, initiating Govinda dāsī and Jadurāṇī into the Gāyatrīmantra.\nA few days later a group of devotees came from New York and Prabhupāda initiated morebrāhmaṇas.One morning, when he saw a group of newbrāhmaṇainitiates coming to join him on his walk, he said, “Oh, here come thebrāhmaṇas.But now don’t bebrāhmaṇasin name only.”\nThe bus was painted green, had a cracked windshield, no seats, and a dubious engine. It was unregistered and uninsured. Haṁsadūta, who had received the bus as a donation, planned to use it for the world-touringsaṅkīrtanaparty Prabhupāda had asked him to form. Before Śrīla Prabhupāda and a gathering of devotees in Prabhupāda’s room, Haṁsadūta talked enthusiastically about the newly donated bus. Prabhupāda asked to go for a ride.\nRohiṇī-kumāra:This bus was so horrible. It was in terrible condition and rattling so much. It was on the verge of breaking down at any minute. The only seat on the bus was the driver’s seat, so someone got a chair from the house for Swamiji to sit on. He sat in front like the captain of a ship. He was completely transcendental to the whole horrible situation. And I felt very bad. I thought, “Oh, Swamiji shouldn’t have to ride in such a horrible bus.”\nWhat began as a group of devotees taking their spiritual master on a short ride suddenly changed when, after going a block, Prabhupāda began giving the driver directions: “Go to the right, turn left, turn here, now go here.” With the bus’s engine coughing sporadically, the ride remained rough and rickety, despite several men pooling their weight against the legs of the chair. But by following Prabhupāda’s directions, they soon arrived at the waterfront. Prabhupāda said he wanted to go to Commonwealth Pier, the first place he had come in America when, in September of 1965, he had arrived from India aboard theJaladuta.The boys marvelled as Prabhupāda continued to direct them to Commonwealth Pier.\n“I first came here,” Prabhupāda said, as he walked along the pier with his disciples. “I thought, ‘I don’t know why I have come here. The language is different, the idea is different. They are all after sense gratification. I don’t know why I’ve come here.’ But now I have got some boys, and even if I am not here, it will go on.”\nAs the devotees walked beside Prabhupāda, trying to hear him speak, they could see the city skyline nearby. One large building was being torn down, and new ones were going up. “So many strong buildings,” Prabhupāda said, “being torn down and then rebuilt. There is no pleasure in it, neither in building nor in tearing down. Nobody is happy. It is like with a small child. He is happy to get a toy, and then he is happy to break it. But there is no real happiness. Just like the boy and girl – they come together in union, and then they separate, divorce. There is no real happiness in the union or in the separation. Real happiness is in union with Kṛṣṇa and separation frommāyā.But it ismāyāthat again and again causes this union and separation in the material world.”\nAs they walked together under a steel bridge, Prabhupāda pointed upward with his walking cane, “Look” – a sign under the bridge read UNALLOYED STEEL – “they have unalloyed steel, and we have unalloyed devotional service.”\n“What if people don’t want to hear our message?” Pradyumna asked.\n“The people might not understand our message, but Kṛṣṇa will be pleased,” Prabhupāda replied. “And that is our mission. They thought Jesus Christ’s mission was stopped. They killed him. But his mission was attained. He preached three years only, but so many followers. He pleased Kṛṣṇa. We must not be disappointed that no one is hearing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We will say it to the moon and stars and all directions. We will cry in the wilderness, because Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. We want to get a certificate from Kṛṣṇa that, ‘This man has done something for Me.’ Not popularity. If a pack of asses says you are good, what is that? We have to please Kṛṣṇa’s senses with purified senses.”\nFor an hour Prabhupāda led them up and down the unattractive, historic pier. Finally, he stood by the bus about to return. “All religion is useless,” he said, “until we know that this world is useless. It is not wanted. That is real knowledge. And when you know this, then there is no attachment. And then immediately no hankering and loss. But now they are hankering, ‘I have no girlfriend’ and then ‘I’ve lost my girlfriend.’ ”\nVāmanadeva had trouble starting the engine, and even after he got it started, it stalled several times on the way back to Chester Street. When Prabhupāda arrived at his house, he said they should sell the bus. Such vehicles presented a bad public image. Having a bus was a good idea, but not a bus like that.\nWith Prabhupāda’s permission, the devotees scheduled him for the all-nightUncle Jay Show,a talk show on radio station WMEX. At 11:00 P.M. three devotees – Satsvarūpa and Pradyumna, in suits and ties, and Jadurāṇī in asārī– went on the air. Prabhupāda was scheduled to join them at 3 o’clock.\n“I have before me in the studio tonight,” Uncle Jay began, “two nice young men and a young woman who have normal American names like Steve and Paul and Judy. And when you hear them speak, they sound like normal Americans. But if you could see them – they look a little unusual. Down the front of their noses they have some white paint. … ”\nUncle Jay’s listeners began calling in questions, and although most of the questions were trivial, the devotees got many good opportunities to talk about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Finally, around 3:00 A.M. Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived. He had risen according to his usual schedule and had come directly to the station. Impressed by Prabhupāda, Uncle Jay received him politely and had him sit down and begin answering questions.\nQuestion: “I heard a swami can’t pass over water, so how did you get to the U.S.A.?”\nPrabhupāda: “No, why not? That is superstition. Lord Caitanya said to spread this philosophy all over the world, in every town and village. So He certainly knew I would have to cross over the water.”\nQuestion: “How did you become a swami?”\nPrabhupāda: “Everyone is expected to become a swami. Suppose one lives a hundred years. The fourth state is to renounce and completely be engaged in controlling the senses. So it takes seventy-five years to become a swami.”\nQuestion: “Did you give up your wife?”\nPrabhupāda: “Woman is not given up. She is always dependent – on her father as a young girl and then on her husband, then on her children, older sons. I was in India recently and my son saw me, but my wife could not see me.”\nQuestion: “In this country we would call that desertion.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, it is a question of progress. There is no divorce. She’s a devotee of another swami. The wife generally is not allowed to be the student of her husband who has become a swami.”\nQuestion: “Do you believe the soul is immortal?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes,youknow the soul is immortal. Immortality is not a question of belief. It is a fact. You know what you were in your childhood and your youth … ”\nQuestion: “What does it mean in the Bible, ‘The soul that sinneth also dieth’?”\nUncle Jay interrupted and said that since this was a question about the Bible, the caller should ask his priest and not trouble the Swami.\nBut Prabhupāda interrupted: “No, we can answer this. He who identifies with the body commits practical suicide. He forgets himself. Those who are sinful forget their spiritual identity, and they have to take another body.”\nQuestion: “What impelled you to takesannyāsa?”\nPrabhupāda: “Routine work. One has to become a swami. It is not a hobby. Because they don’t takesannyāsa,they suffer.”\nQuestion: “You say meditation is very difficult. How does chanting make it easier?”\nPrabhupāda: “At the present moment, meditation in its pure form is not possible. To do it properly, one has to control the senses, follow the rules, practice the sitting posture, thinking, feeling, become absorbed in thought. But chanting – as soon as you hear ‘Kṛṣṇa,’ immediately the mind is attracted. There is no necessity of prequalification. Anyone in any country can sit down and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and he will find himself in complete meditation.”\nUncle Jay: “So Maharishi’s transcendental meditation is nothing new?”\nPrabhupāda: “No. He says to go and enjoy and simply pay him thirty-five dollars. But you have to control your senses, or how can you meditate? Because you do not want to practice, you do not want to follow. I was surprised that people in America and Western Europe took these cheap things. You don’t want the real thing. Theseyogīsnever restrict their students. If they restrict their students, the students do not come and pay the fees.”\nUncle Jay: “When I was small, I read a book about swamis who slept on beds of nails. Are you that kind of swami?”\nPrabhupāda: “That is just a trick. That is not perfection.”\nUncle Jay: “Do you mean when you say swami means ‘control of the senses’ that if I cut you, you won’t feel pain?”\nPrabhupāda: “That is not perfection. If you take even chloroform, then you will not feel pain – as in a surgical operation. Control of the senses means that I can be in the midst of beautiful women, but I will feel no desire for sex. I have got sufficient strength, but I have no desire for this. That is real control of the senses.”\nAnd so it went until five in the morning.\nOn the way home, Śrīla Prabhupāda rode in the front seat of the taxi beside the driver. Understanding he had an unusual passenger, the driver – who had been listening to theUncle Jay Show –asked Prabhupāda, “Are you similar to that transcendental meditation swami?”\n“We are similar,” Prabhupāda said, “in that he is a Hindu sage and we are a Hindu sage. But his method, meditation, is actually a very difficult process. But ours is very easy – chanting.”\nThe children on Chester Street would call out “Hare Kṛṣṇa!” whenever they saw Prabhupāda come out of his apartment. They were making fun, but Prabhupāda liked it. Once when a devotee tried to stop the children, Prabhupāda said, “Oh, no, they are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That’s all right.” He said Chester Street should now be called Hare Kṛṣṇa Street.\nIt was in Swamiji’s room one day on Hare Kṛṣṇa Street that he accepted the name Prabhupāda. While Govinda dāsī was taking dictation, Prabhupāda mentioned that the affix “ji” was a third-class address.\n“Then why do we call you Swami-ji?” she asked. “What should we call you?” “A spiritual master,” Prabhupāda replied, “is usually addressed by names like Gurudeva, Viṣṇupāda, or Prabhupāda.” “May we call you Prabhupāda?” she asked. “Yes.” And Govinda dāsī told the others. At first some of the devotees were reluctant to give up the long-cherished “Swamiji,” which for them was a name of affection. “I heard we shouldn’t use the name Swamiji anymore,” one of the boys asked one morning on a walk. “Who said?” Prabhupāda replied quickly. “They said you said it was third class, and we shouldn’t say it.”\n“I never said that.” “Then we can use it?” “Yes, that is all right.” But “Swamiji” soon disappeared. Rāya Rāma even printed an explanation inBack to Godhead.\nPrabhupāda’s next destination was fixed for Montreal. Satsvarūpa, Pradyumna, and Jadurāṇī, all of whom had drunk deeply of Prabhupāda’s personal association, got their last bearings directly from him.\n“I am scheduled to leave for Montreal in two days,” Prabhupāda said to Satsvarūpa on a morning walk. “Is that all right?” Satsvarūpa felt strange that Prabhupāda would ask him for permission to leave. He also felt sad. But he could think of no way to detain him.\nAs they walked, they passed a toy store displaying guns and battleships in the window.\n“This is the kind of thing we grew up with,” Satsvarūpa told Prabhupāda. “But you grew up with Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities. Does this still affect us?”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said, “the impression is still there.”\n“Prabhupāda,” Satsvarūpa asked, “now that you are with us, we can ask you any necessary direction. But in the future, when you are not always with us, how can we get direction from you?”\n“Kṛṣṇa’s name is not different than Kṛṣṇa. Do you understand?”\n“Yes,” Satsvarūpa replied. But he knew his understanding was only theoretical. He knew he would have to think more deeply on Prabhupāda’s answer. Prabhupāda was indicating that by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Himself would be present, so the disciple could get direction from Him, by the grace of the spiritual master.\nIn Jadurāṇī’s case there was no doubt that she should continue painting. She had often gone to Prabhupāda’s house for detailed instructions. When she had shown him a just-completed portrait of his own spiritual master sitting amidst trees and greenery, Prabhupāda had commented, “You have put my Guru Mahārāja in the American forest! He was never in such a forest.” He told her to paint Lord Caitanya in a garden scene but not to copy the Indian print showing anOṁsign and Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa above Lord Caitanya’s head. “That is an artist’s imagination,” Prabhupāda said. “Thisis the way Lord Caitanya appeared in Navadvīpa. Don’t change anything. And Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja should be colored as Indians are generally – a light brown, tan like wheat. Balarāmajī is colored milk white with little bluish tint and rosy luster.”\nPrabhupāda also encouraged Pradyumna, telling him just what he wanted to hear: he should continue studying Sanskrit so that he could make transliterations for all of Prabhupāda’s work and eventually come to the standard of a good Sanskrit scholar for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Pradyumna asked to come to Montreal with Prabhupāda and learn more things from him. Prabhupāda agreed.\nWhen the day came for Prabhupāda’s departure, the devotees accompanied him to the airport. In the departure lounge, an unknown boy suddenly appeared and sat at Prabhupāda’s feet. “Can you see God?” the boy asked.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied. “At every moment.”\n“Are you liberated?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then, if you’re liberated,” the boy challenged, “why don’t you go back to the spiritual world – right now?”\n“Don’t be crazy,” said Prabhupāda. “We go when Kṛṣṇa desires. We have already surrendered. So we shall go when Kṛṣṇa desires. We have just bought tickets for Montreal, so we are assured of going there. But it is not that as soon as we buy the tickets, we turn and say, ‘Where is Montreal?’ No. Everything will happen in due course. We have bought the tickets. We are waiting. Soon the plane will leave.”\nPrabhupāda advised the boy to stay with the devotees in the Boston temple and hear from them. In time, he said, the boy would be able to understand.\nJadurāṇī: Govindadāsī and I got on the plane with Prabhupāda, just so we could see him up to the last minute. His last words to us were from theBhāgavatam.He quoted two verses:vāsudeva-parā vedā vāsudevaparā yogā/ vāsudeva-paraṁ jñānam … .This means that Kṛṣṇa is the goal ofyoga,He is the benefactor of fruitive activities, He is the cause of theVedas– Kṛṣṇa is everything. And I began to cry because Prabhupāda was leaving. He reached over and passed his hand over my face. Iasked him, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, sometimes when we ask you something and you give us permission, are you being like the Supersoul? Are you just giving us sanction for whatwewant?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda replied, “When the spiritual master speaks, it is Kṛṣṇa speaking.”\nWhen Prabhupāda got to Montreal he wrote me a letter within a day or two, saying, “I am simply remembering your face when you were crying in the plane.” And then he gave me an order: “Please don’t be agitated in any way. Kṛṣṇa is always with you, and He is always your friend. So many disturbing elements may enter into your life, but a devotee is never agitated.”"

        "chapter_title": "A Summer in Montreal",
        "content": "MontrealJune 3, 1968\nIN MONTREAL PRABHUPĀDA often sang a Sanskrit prayer composed by a great Vaiṣṇava, King Kulaśekhara. While walking around his room, sitting at his desk, or roaming through the house, he would sing to himself, and the others would hear him. He would chant it – it is a Sanskritmantra –but to a tune of his own in a voice that dropped to a deep, low tone at the end of a line.\nIn India almost twenty years ago, Prabhupāda had translated and written commentary on this and several other verses – “The Prayers of King Kulaśekhara” – for hisBack to Godheadnewspaper. Now, during the summer of 1968, while still recovering from his heart attack of a year ago, he sang this particular verse often. And several times he explained its meaning to the devotees gathered in his room in the evening.\n“Swans have a proclivity to stick their long necks underwater and wrap them around the stem of the lotus flower. So King Kulaśekhara is praying, ‘My dear Kṛṣṇa, may the swan of my mind enter the network of the stem of Your lotus feet.’ He is praying to do so now, at the present moment, while he is healthy and can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and entangle his mind in Kṛṣṇa thought. Therefore, King Kulaśekhara wishes that he may die immediately, because he fears that if he waits until later, when the time of death comes, he will be choking. The elements of his body will be disturbed, and there will be a death rattle, like ‘gar, gar.’ How will it be possible then to remember Kṛṣṇa?”\nPrabhupāda’s health, however, had improved. Rising early, dictatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,going for morning walks, taking full lunch – he was the healthiest he had been in months. After lunch he would nap. (At least he would try, although many of the floorboards in the house would squeak loudly when stepped on.) Later in the afternoon he would often ask for watermelon or cantaloupe. And in the evening, either he would meet with devotees in his room or go to the temple forkīrtanaand a lecture. After returning at night he would call for “that puffed rice set”: puffed rice, fried peanuts, fried potatoes, and slices of cucumber.\nSo Prabhupāda was well, yet more than once he remarked to his servants, “If I become sick, do not take me to the hospital. Simply let me chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and die.”\nThe summer of 1968 was a relaxed time, without many outside engagements. Prabhupāda would spend most of his time in his apartment on Prince Arthur Street, a five-minute walk from the temple. In his room he would often meet with disciples visiting from various centers in the United States. Sometimes he would sit in a chair on the front lawn, speaking to visitors, or in the later morning sit out back in the driveway, while Gaurasundara massaged him.\nOne day while Prabhupāda sat in the warm late-morning sun, some of his disciples came and sat on the ground at his feet. “The sunshine is so powerful,” Prabhupāda explained. “There are planets where the trees are miles tall, just being supported by the sunshine. And all the planets are supported by the sunshine. It is so powerful.”\nOne of Prabhupāda’s reasons for coming to Canada was to get permanent residency status in both Canada and the United States. While in Boston, he had received an “Order of Denial” from the Immigration Department, directing him to leave the country. For the past three years, except for his six months in India, Prabhupāda had managed to extend his stay in the U.S. by extending his temporary visa; but now, on a technicality, he had been denied permanent residency. From Montreal he wrote the district director of the U.S. Immigration in Boston.\nBrahmānanda wrote Prabhupāda from New York explaining his plan to get a lawyer and to appeal. But Prabhupāda, now skeptical of U.S. lawyers, who took money and resolved nothing, chose instead to make a new application as religious minister for ISKCON. Although U.S. Immigration had denied his application, ostensibly on the grounds that he had been in the wrong immigration status, Śrīla Prabhupāda suspected that the State Department was not overly fond of Indian swamis.\nPrabhupāda accepted the denial of permanent residency in the United States as Kṛṣṇa’s desire and blessing. Now, instead of returning to the U.S., he would go to London and the European continent. Mukunda, Śyāmasundara, and other disciples in San Francisco had asked Prabhupāda if they could open a center in London, and on June 7 Prabhupāda replied.\nPrabhupāda’s plan was to travel and preach with a party of devotees who would support themselves by distributing Kṛṣṇa conscious literature. But as Śyāmasundara was already building a cart for the second annual Ratha-yātrā festival in San Francisco, and as his wife was pregnant, Prabhupāda advised him to wait. After the Ratha-yātrā festival and after his wife had delivered her baby and taken a month’s rest, Śyāmasundara and his family could go to England. Prabhupāda asked that Mukunda also go. “I shall go to England for the time being,” Prabhupāda wrote Mukunda, “and start a center there which is long overdue.”\nBut more important than traveling or obtaining permanent residency in the U.S. was the publication of Prabhupāda’s books. Prabhupāda felt that writing and printing books was his best contribution in executing his spiritual master’s order. So when Brahmānanda came to Montreal from New York with the printer’s galley proofs ofBhagavad-gītāandTeachings of Lord Caitanya,Prabhupāda was very pleased.\nMacmillan Company was publishingBhagavad-gītā,and Prabhupāda himself was publishingTeachings of Lord Caitanyathrough Dai Nippon in Japan. Because Brahmānanda had contacted the editors at Macmillan Company, Prabhupāda credited him with the success of the Gītā’sbeing published by such a famous company. Brahmānanda was also Prabhupāda’s man for dealing with Dai Nippon. Both books were on tight printing schedules, and Brahmānanda had to return quickly to New York with the corrected proofs.\nBrahmānanda:I came up to show Prabhupāda the galley proofs for bothTeachings of Lord CaitanyaandBhagavad-gītā As It Is.I just happened to have both galley proofs that had arrived. So it was a wonderful thing to bring these galley proofs to Prabhupāda for checking. I was there only for a few days, maybe a weekend or so. Prabhupāda personally read through the entire galleys and made notations in his own hand. He did the proofreading of the galleys. Everything was done by Śrīla Prabhupāda. It was a very personal kind of thing. Of course, that gave Prabhupāda great pleasure because he wanted his books published, and we had started to do it. So Prabhupāda took great pleasure in proofreading those galleys. And he handed them to me, and it was very wonderful.\n“When one of my books is published,” Prabhupāda said, “I feel like I have conquered an empire.” Having books in print gave meaning to Prabhupāda’s fight for U.S. residency. And only with these books published could he tour Europe. Kṛṣṇa conscious literature was solid evidence that his movement was not a concocted, fly-by-nightyogī’sdream. Let the government leaders and scholars read these books. Let the student community read them. Any intelligent man would be impressed. These books were the most enduring glorification of Kṛṣṇa and the most powerful propaganda for spreading Kṛṣṇa’s teachings throughout the world. Far from being the speculations of an ordinary, conditioned soul subject to mistakes and cheating, these books contained the teachings and activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa – the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness – passed down by the greatācāryas.They were books of perfect knowledge.\nBefore Brahmānanda left Montreal, Prabhupāda asked him to send theŚrīmad-BhāgavatamSecond and Third Canto manuscripts from the closet in his New York apartment. By October, as soon asTeachings of Lord Caitanyawas printed, he would have the manuscripts ready for Dai Nippon. Speaking to Brahmānanda and others in his room, Prabhupāda charged them with the organization of book sales. There would be no scarcity of books, but his disciples would have to sell them.\nWhen Prabhupāda had been alone in India, he had printed, gathered statements from scholars, advertised, and distributed his books. But now he was depending on his disciples. They recognized the importance of his books, but they had no ideas or means for distributing them. Prabhupāda assured them, however, that by applying his instructions and trusting in Kṛṣṇa for results, they would be successful.\nPrabhupāda and Brahmānanda discussed plans for starting their own printing press – perhaps in Montreal. With the costs of printing so high, Prabhupāda wanted some of his disciples to learn the techniques of book publication. He suggested that one of his disciples in New York learn to run a press and some of the girls learn to compose type. Thus in the future he might be able to start his own press in some convenient location.\nDespite Prabhupāda’s plans for preaching in Europe, obtaining permanent residency in the United States and Canada, printing his books, and starting a press, his life remained regulated and simple. He would giveŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamlectures in the temple and daily see guests in his room. Constantly thinking, writing, chanting, and speaking about Kṛṣṇa and how to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Prabhupāda was the driving force of a revolutionary movement. Yet he mostly stayed at home, spending much of his time alone or in simple domestic dealings with his servants.\nOne quiet afternoon in Prabhupāda’s sitting room, Govinda dāsī was bringing Prabhupāda hisprasādamwhen Prabhupāda spied a baby rat running across the floor. Immediately Govinda dāsī set the tray ofprasādamdown and tried to catch the rat as it darted toward Prabhupāda’s desk. Getting up quickly from his seat, Prabhupāda also joined excitedly in the chase. Then another rat appeared. When Harināma, visiting from San Francisco, heard the commotion, he came to the door and offered to help. Taking up a shoebox, he began chasing the rats, finally catching them both and letting them loose outside.\nLater Prabhupāda walked into the room where Gaurasundara and Govinda dāsī were working and told them, “If you kept everything very clean, these rats wouldn’t come. If someone is very much attached to his dwelling, then he may take his next birth in that dwelling as a cockroach or a rat. These are sinful living entities, and they are taking their birth because of that attachment.” He then asked Śivānanda to seal up the cracks in the floor.\n“Why are these peanuts black?” Prabhupāda asked as she served him hisprasādam.“Why have you made them black?” When Govinda dāsī began to cry, Prabhupāda criticized her all the more: “Why are you crying? You are crying because you are angry. Why have you done this?” His stern and angry look made her tears come even harder.\n“I am not angry,” she sobbed. “I am very sorry I made the peanuts too dark.”\nOnce Govinda dāsī lent the dictating machine to a Godsister, who broke it, and Prabhupāda became disgusted: “You American boys and girls! You are rich men’s sons, so you simply think you can break something and then throw it in the street and buy a new one. You do not take care of such things. Only one person should use a machine. You should not have allowed her to use it.” These words devastated Govinda dāsī, and she retired to cry for a while. But she soon recovered, and Prabhupāda acted as if the scene had never taken place. Govinda dāsī took the chastisement as a test of her sincerity. And she had learned that Prabhupāda’s thunderbolts were generally followed by his usual kindness and gentleness.\nPrabhupāda rarely went anywhere alone. For his disciples it was unthinkable that he should go somewhere without one of them accompanying him to care for his needs or to confront whatever difficulties might arise. So when one afternoon Govinda dāsī looked in Prabhupāda’s room and found him gone, she became perplexed. Seeing that his shoes were gone, she ran out to the street. Unable to see him in either direction, she ran down to the corner, where she saw him in the distance, walking away. When she finally caught up to him, she asked in a voice distraught and breathless, “Where are you going? Why have you left?”\nPrabhupāda laughed quietly as he walked erect with his cane, his movements flowing. “Oh,” he said, “I am just going to the bank. It’s all right. I’ll be back.”\nGovinda dāsī apologized for being so demanding. “I just thought you shouldn’t go alone. Because you have been ill … ”\nPrabhupāda snapped back, “What do you know? Physician, heal thyself.” And he walked on, leaving Govinda dāsī behind.\nAs far as Prabhupāda was concerned, it was Govinda dāsī who was sickly, not he. She was always bundled in sweaters and coats or blowing her nose. Once he had gone into the room where she and Gaurasundara worked, and it had been messy, with tissues thrown here and there. “This is why you are always getting sick,” he had said, “because of uncleanliness.”\nAnother day Prabhupāda, accompanied by Gaurasundara and Govinda dāsī, was walking out of the house on his way to the temple when he began laughing, saying, “Yes, Govinda dāsī, everything is nice! You are an excellent secretary, an excellent cook, and you are good at everything. Your only disqualification is that you are a woman. But don’t worry. Next life you shall be abrahmacārī!”\n“Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Govinda dāsī replied, enjoying Prabhupāda’s joking mood.\nOften, Prabhupāda, taking the part of the Māyāvādī, would debate with Gaurasundara. Early one morning Śrīla Prabhupāda walked into the room where Gaurasundara was sleeping and woke him with an argument of Māyāvāda philosophy: “Kṛṣṇa’s personality must be a product of illusion, because the Absolute is defined as beyond personality.” And Gaurasundara had to immediately refute the argument.\nPrabhupāda would sometimes remark that eventually Gaurasundara and Govinda dāsī should travel together to some part of the world and preach. Kṛṣṇa consciousness had to be introduced in so many places, and Prabhupāda envisioned that one day his servant and secretary would go off to open a new center. “Taking care of my body,” he said, “is not such an important thing.”\nOne day Prabhupāda and Gaurasundara were discussing philosophy while Govinda dāsī spent a long time in the kitchen washing pots and dishes. The noise of her cleaning carried into Prabhupāda’s room. “She has this cleanliness disease,” Prabhupāda warned. “My wife and daughter also had it. You should catch it while it is not developed. Otherwise it will get worse. I caught my daughter once – she was washing the electric sockets by splashing water into them. And I told her, ‘Do not ever do this again. If you do this, I will kill you!’ So she promised she would never do it again.”\nWhile Prabhupāda was in Montreal, many of his disciples from the United States came to visit him. They were serving on his behalf, some of them thousands of miles away, and the urge to see him would grow until it impelled them to travel to Montreal. Sometimes these visitors would be newcomers who had joined one of Prabhupāda’s temples and had heard about him from his disciples but had never seen him. Prabhupāda was always happy, of course, when his disciples remained in their posts, executing their respective duties. But he was also glad when they came to visit him.\nNanda-kiśora:I walked into the room, and Śrīla Prabhupāda greeted me very enthusiastically with a smile and said, “American Vaiṣṇava.” I paid obeisances, sat down, and we began to talk. I had heard that Kṛṣṇa could be in the heart of every living entity at the same time, so I asked Prabhupāda how it was possible.\nHe began by saying, “Just try to understand.” So I tried. I strained and squinted to show that I was really trying to understand. And Prabhupāda continued, “Just like the sun is over your head and mine and is over the head of someone who may be a thousand miles away. That is because the sun is great. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is so great that He is simultaneously in the hearts of all living entities.”\nAnd I understood. He had said, “Try to understand,” and because I was hearing, I did understand. I was trying to understand, and I was hearing from the pure devotee. As I was leaving his room, he waved his right hand in the air, sitting back in a very relaxed way, smiling. He said, “Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa! Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa!”\nKṛṣṇadāsa:I had heard that Prabhupāda was planning to travel abroad and that he wanted to take several devotees with him and that whoever wanted to go should save his money. So I got a job with a jewelry firm. Then I had a vacation while Prabhupāda was in Montreal. Uddhava and I were having our vacation at the same time, and we decided over breakfast one morning to go see Prabhupāda in Montreal. In one hour we were packed.\nWearing suits, we hitchhiked from San Francisco to New York in three days. When we got to Montreal, Gaurasundara said, “Well, Prabhupāda is about to have lunch. Would you care to join him?” We said yes. Uddhava and I went in, and Prabhupāda was immediately very thankful that we had come so far to visit him.\nBut as we had come to lunch so late, there wasn’t really enoughprasādamfor two guests. So Gaurasundara first served Prabhupāda, and we sat there with our empty plates. Then Prabhupāda asked, “What abouttheirfood?” Govinda dāsī went to get something for us, and Prabhupāda said to me, “You are very thin. You look sickly. You should eat more.” So he proceeded to take food off his plate and put it on my empty plate. And he told me to eat. He said I should eat sixcapātīsa day. He gave me a whole diet to follow so I could gain weight.\nDuring lunch a mouse came into the room, and Gaurasundara captured it. Prabhupāda joked about how the mouse had been a devotee in his past life and had come back in this life to eatprasādamoff the floor. Afterwards we paid our obeisances. I touched my head to Prabhupāda’s foot, and he got up and walked over and rubbed our heads.\nJeffrey Hickey (Jagadīśa dāsa):When I entered Prabhupāda’s apartment, I got the most amazing feeling. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja and Hayagrīva were there talking to Prabhupāda about New Vrindaban. They were saying that they had bought some land, and Prabhupāda was encouraging them. I just sat in the back and listened to what was going on.\nPrabhupāda’s presence was very strong. I felt small. And I had the feeling that he knew everything about me and that I couldn’t pretend to be someone big – although previously I had always thought of myself as being a little advanced. But in Prabhupāda’s presence I couldn’t pose as anything because I understood that he knew everything about me and could understand my mentality. So I just sat with my face turned downwards. Once in a while I would look up at him.\nI was in Prabhupāda’s room for about half an hour. I wanted to say something, but I didn’t know what to say. So at the end, while everyone was leaving, I bowed down and let the others leave first. Then as I was about to leave, I told Prabhupāda that I was chanting sixteen rounds daily and that I expected to get initiated later. He welcomed me to stay in the Montreal temple, and I fumbled some reply.\nVaikuṇṭhanātha:I was in great anxiety because I had just returned from my draft board physical. But as soon as I walked into Prabhupāda’s room, all my anxiety completely melted. As soon as I came into his presence, I thought, “How wonderful he is.” Spiritual truth became real in his presence.\nŚivānanda:I had come to Montreal to visit Prabhupāda, but Gaurasundara and Govinda dāsī didn’t want many devotees going with him on the morning walk. One morning I was out for a walk by myself when I met Prabhupāda. He motioned to me and said, “Come on.” As we walked, I mentioned to Prabhupāda that I had traveled in various places in Europe and all over America, and he said, “Oh, yes, you must go to these places and open some temples.”\nAt that time the word was out that Prabhupāda wanted some of his disciples to go to London to open a temple there. So as I was walking along with Śrīla Prabhupāda – we were just about to cross the street –  Prabhupāda turned to me and said, “Kṛṣṇa says inBhagavad-gītāthat ‘One who is spreading My teachings ofBhagavad-gītāto the devotees is the most dear to Me, and there is never one who is more dear.’ ” Then Prabhupāda added, “Our business is to become dear to Kṛṣṇa.” That started me thinking about opening a center somewhere.\nBrahmānanda:Prabhupāda would just talk. Often there wouldn’t be any questions, and he would just get on a topic and talk, sitting casually. Sometimes it wouldn’t even be directly about Kṛṣṇa, but he would describe different things about life in India or some other topic. He would always make sure that everyone had someprasādam.One night he was explaining to a visitor that his disciples – “these American boys and girls” – were taking up Kṛṣṇa consciousness naturally, not artificially. He referred to his servant Gaurasundara: “Actually, he is doing so many nice things for me all day long because he loves me. It is not artificial.”\nGovinda dāsī:One time there was an elaborate discussion about whether trains were better than buses or buses were better than trains. Another time Prabhupāda was talking about liquor, and I said, “Oh, Śrīla Prabhupāda, whiskey tastes awful!” He was shocked. He said, “Oh. You have tasted?” He was surprised that I had tasted liquor. He talked in detail about Bengal tigers and all sorts of other things.\nMost of the devotees were not so astute – most of us were just recovering from being hippies and taking drugs – but everyone loved him very much. Actually, there was no name and fame. There was no money. There was no position. The center of our service, the motivating factor, was simply love of Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nNanda-kiśora:Prabhupāda explained how he had first seen snow when he had come to America. He said, “One day I looked out the window and Ithought, ‘Oh, someone has taken lime and thrown it all over.’ And then Ilooked up at the sky and thought, ‘Oh, they are still throwing.’ ” And then he laughed. I could hardly believe he had never seen snow fall before. He was like a child. He said such things so beautifully, like an innocent child, that whatever doubt I had was just wiped away due to the beauty of his expression.\nSatyabhāmā:Prabhupāda told a story about a man from Calcutta who could tell the make of any car just by hearing it. I think Prabhupāda was making an important philosophical point, but I forget the point. Anyway, this man’s friend wanted to test the other man’s ability to judge cars just by their sound. So together they went and stood on a street corner in Calcutta. The friend blindfolded the other man, and as each car passed by, the man would identify it: “That is a Cadillac …, that is a Buick …” Then a donkey came walking by, dragging some tin cans, and the man said, “Oh, that is a Ford.”\nKṛṣṇadāsa and Uddhava told Prabhupāda about the San Francisco Ratha-yātrā, and they handed him a newspaper clipping. Prabhupāda read the headline aloud: “S.F. Paraders Hail Hindu God Krishna.” After noting with pleasure the large photo of devotees pulling the ropes of the “2-ton wagon on long haul to celebrate Ratha-yātrā festival,” he handed the newspaper back to Kṛṣṇadāsa: “Read it.” After hearing the article, Prabhupāda praised the devotees – especially Śyāmasundara and Jayānanda – for constructing an attractive cart and holding such a successful festival.\nThen Prabhupāda began to talk of other successes within his new movement. He had heard reports that in San Francisco Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had organized the devotees to go out and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa every day and that in one day they had sold a hundred copies ofBack to Godhead.Devotees in New York and Boston, he said, were also going out and chanting, distributing magazines, and collecting as much as forty dollars in a day. He told the disciples gathered in his room that they should all expect to perform publickīrtanain the important cities of the world. Takingmṛdaṅgasandkaratālas,they could performkīrtanaanywhere and get the blessings of Lord Caitanya. In this way their numbers would increase. Prabhupāda told them, “If you want to live alone in a secluded place and practiceyogafor your own personal advantage, that is very good. But if you want to help others by spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is far better.”\nPrabhupāda said that although a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is not anxious on his own behalf, he is anxious for those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, the mass of people who simply engage in sense gratification within a civilization of illusion. Quoting the greatācāryaJīva Gosvāmī, Prabhupāda said that a devotee who chooses to sit in Vṛndāvana and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa should make only one or two disciples; but a missionary, who preaches Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world, should make as many disciples as possible.\n“So you are being initiated,” Prabhupāda addressed the devotees in his room, “therefore you should make it your responsibility and duty to spread this message – to follow the principles strictly and becomepureVaiṣṇavas and preach all over the world. Don’t worry about where you will sleep or eat, Kṛṣṇa will see to all these things. You simply have to become sincere in service. That’s all. Just be sincere.”\nGovinda dāsī raised her hand. “Prabhupāda,” she asked, “what does it mean exactly to surrender?”\n“Surrender,” Prabhupāda replied, “is to know that ‘I am nothing…’ ” As Prabhupāda spoke, Govinda dāsī, accustomed to taking dictation, wrote down the answer, while other devotees – some seated on the floor around Prabhupāda’s desk, some standing in the doorway – listened attentively. “I should know,” Prabhupāda continued, “I am less than the stool of a hog. And Kṛṣṇa – You are everything. That is very difficult. We can find millions of Isaac Newtons and Einsteins, but one very rare soul might be surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. Because it is very difficult. So as long as you are thinking that ‘He is more learned than me’ or ‘I am more learned than him’ – that is material. You must know that you are nothing and surrender.”\nA new boy who had been attending Śrīla Prabhupāda’s classes asked, “Why is it that one time I feel this way, like you say, ‘surrendered,’ but at other times I forget?”\nPrabhupāda: “That ismāyā.That is our battle withmāyā.We are inmāyā’skingdom, so we have to fight. It is like an ocean, birth and death. There are so many universes and so many species of life, and we are transmigrating birth after birth. It is like you are standing on the edge of a boat, and just a little shove and you may fall into the ocean. Then you do not know where you are going, here or there. So it is like that. If you want to keep back even one percent – to surrender all but one percent – then you have to stay here. Kṛṣṇa is so strict. If you have any desire for material enjoyment, you have to remain. Just one percent may take millions of years. So you have to surrender everything.\n“Kṛṣṇa consciousness is already there within you and within everyone, but it has to be invoked. It is like a match, and if you rub it, fire comes out. And that rubbing process is chanting. So we have to inject Kṛṣṇa consciousness into the ear, and we have to go on injecting. Wherever you go, you have to chant – and without any motive.”\nGaurasundara brought in a plate of cut fruit, which Śrīla Prabhupāda distributed to each person. It was late, but Prabhupāda continued speaking: “People want to go on asking God for bread. But as soon as there is bread elsewhere, they won’t go to church. But if you teach people to love God – that they will never forget.” Prabhupāda smiled. Finally the devotees left him, satisfied. They would see him in the temple in the morning.\nMontreal temple, established now for a year and a half, occupied a former bowling alley on the third floor of a building near McGill University. Although the gutters on either side of the eight bowling lanes had been filled in with wood, thus creating a smooth, level floor, the eight hardwood lanes were still prominent. An altar andvyāsāsanastood against one wall, and a temporary wall partitioned off the men’s quarters. There was also a kitchen and separate quarters for the women. With difficulty Prabhupāda would daily climb the two flights of stairs and enter the spacious temple room. On the day of his arrival in Montreal, several devotees had carried him up the stairs in a palanquin, but the winding staircase made that too difficult to do daily. So Prabhupāda chose to walk.\nThe original Montreal devotee was Janārdana, a Canadian attending McGill University. Janārdana wore a beard and long hair, even after his initiation, and lived in an apartment with his wife, who was staunchly opposed to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Acknowledging Janārdana as an intellectual, Prabhupāda had written him long letters answering his philosophical doubts and requesting that he write essays and books on Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nWhen the temple had first opened, theMcGill Dailyhad given Janārdana a full page to introduce Swami Bhaktivedanta and Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The headlines had read, “Mind Expansion Under Spiritual Guidance.” Montreal’s French daily newspaper,LeNouveau Samedi,interviewed Janārdana and published an article: “They claim that the Hindu God Krishna is the Father of Christ and that the inhabitants of the moon are invisible.”\nAbout a dozen members had joined the Montreal temple, but so far they had done little to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Montreal. They had spent most of their energy maintaining themselves spiritually and financially. Although they had held some publickīrtanasat the 1967 World’s Fair, mostly they had concentrated on transforming the bowling alley, cleaning, cooking for Kṛṣṇa, and meeting together for classes andkīrtanas.\nWhen Śrīla Prabhupāda saw Janārdana’s academic studies distracting him from temple management, he asked Janārdana to appoint a temple commander. One night when Prabhupāda came to the temple for his lecture, as soon as he sat on thevyāsāsana,he looked out to Janārdana and asked, “So, have you found a temple commander yet?”\n“Oh, no,” Janārdana replied, “not yet.”\nPrabhupāda then turned toward the altar and beheld the Deities. “That’s all right,” he said. “Lord Jagannātha is the temple commander. We are His servants.”\nOne evening in the temple, as Prabhupāda concluded his lecture about Prahlāda Mahārāja, he asked if there were any questions. Himavatī, one of the women disciples, raised her hand.\nPrabhupāda: “Yes?”\nHimavatī: “Prahlāda Mahārāja was such a great devotee that he said, ‘nothing is mine.’ But then why does he say ‘myGod’? How could God becomehis? Why does he say that?”\nPrabhupāda: “Then what shall he say?”\nHimavatī: “I don’t understand. How can he say it? If you understand nothing belongs to you, then how can you say, ‘God is mine’?”\nPrabhupāda: Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of everyone. Therefore everyone can say ‘my Lord.’ That does not mean if somebody says ‘my Lord,’ God becomes monopolized. You are speaking on the platform of monopolizing, ‘mine.’ But God is never monopolized. He is everyone’s. So everyone has the right to say ‘my God, my Lord.’ In the material sense, when I say, ‘It is my wife,’ that means she is not any other’s wife. But God is not like that. I can say ‘my God,’ but you can also say ‘my God,’ he can say ‘my God,’ everyone can say ‘my God.’ This is the absolute ‘mine.’\n“Kṛṣṇa says, ‘All these living creatures are My parts and parcels.’Mamaivāṁśo. Mamameans ‘My.’ So why the living creatures shall not say ‘my God’? Do you follow? Kṛṣṇa says, ‘You are Mine.’ Why shall I not say, ‘Kṛṣṇa, You are mine’? Your husband says, ‘You are mine.’ Why shall you not say to him, ‘You are mine’? But don’t take it in the material sense. In material sense, as soon as I say, ‘This is mine,’ then it belongs to no one else. It is my property. But Kṛṣṇa is not like that. So you can say, ‘Kṛṣṇa is mine.’ There is no harm. Rather, if anyone wants to possess something as his, that position should be Kṛṣṇa’s. That is the ultimate conception of ‘mine.’ That is the perfection of the word ‘mine.’\n“So this is quite nice, quite fit. In theBhagavad-gītāKṛṣṇa says, ‘He is Mine, and I am his.’ Kṛṣṇa says. So this is not wrong. And what is your idea? That because everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa therefore I shall not say ‘mine’? That’s your idea?”\nHimavatī: “I didn’t understand this, that Kṛṣṇa is the Lord. So my Lord is everyone else’s Lord.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes.”\nHimavatī: “He is the controller, and that’s why He is mine.”\nPrabhupāda: “He’s mine, He’s yours, everyone’s. That’s all.”\nHimavatī: “I can understand.”\nPrabhupāda: “That’s all.”\nRukmiṇī: “I feel so far away from you, you know, when you are not here.”\nPrabhupāda: “What is that? I can’t follow. Janārdana?”\nJanārdana: “She is saying she felt so far away from you when you were not here.”\nPrabhupāda: “Oh, that you should not think. There are two conceptions, the physical conception and the vibration conception. The physical conception is temporary, and the vibration conception is eternal. Just like we are relishing the vibration of Kṛṣṇa’s teaching. So my vibration is also present. As soon as we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa or chantBhagavad-gītāor theBhāgavata,so Kṛṣṇa is present immediately by vibration. He is absolute. Therefore vibration is more important than physical presence.\n“When you feel separation from your spiritual master, you just try to remember his words and his instructions, and you will not feel separation. You will feel like he is with you. So we should associate by the vibration, not by the physical presence. That is real association –śabdād anavṛtti –by sound. Just like we are touching Kṛṣṇa immediately by sound. So we should give more stress on this sound vibration, either of Kṛṣṇa or of the spiritual master. Then we will feel happy and no separation.\n“When Kṛṣṇa departed from this world, at that time Arjuna was overwhelmed with sorrow, and he began to remember the instruction ofBhagavad-gītā.Then he was pacified. Immediately he began to remember the teaching which was taught to him on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, and he was pacified. Kṛṣṇa was his constant friend, so when the Lord went to His abode, Arjuna was feeling overwhelmed. But he began to remember His teachings. So whenever we shall feel separation, the best thing is to remember the teachings. Then it will be very nice. Is that clear?”\nRukmiṇī: “Yes.”\nOne of the girls asked, “Prabhupāda, will you be our father eternally? Will you always be our spiritual master, eternally?”\nJokingly, Prabhupāda said, “Yes, I think so.” Then he quoted a verse,cakhudāna dilo yei, janme janme prabhu sei,but he said, “…janme janmepītāsei.The one who has opened my eyes – he is my father life after life.”\nPrabhupāda was concerned about the weak financial condition of the Montreal temple. Although some of the devotees were employed, their work wasn’t very auspicious. One disciple had a job – at the No Sags Spring Factory – which Prabhupāda called “ugra-karma,” bitter, unwholesome labor. When Nanda-kiśora told Prabhupāda about his job as a busboy in a restaurant, Prabhupāda replied, “Oh, a blind uncle.” Nanda-kiśora looked puzzled. Prabhupāda told him the story of a boy who had no uncle. One day a blind man came to the boy’s home and said, “I will be your uncle.” “Well,” the boy replied, “a blind uncle is better than no uncle.” But when Nanda-kiśora told Prabhupāda the details of his work and that he was sometimes cooking meat, Prabhupāda remarked, “Oh, but notsoblind.”\nThe question of financing the Montreal temple puzzled Prabhupāda, and he carefully analyzed the situation. There were two paths of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he said: one for those who were renounced, eating fruits from the trees and living in caves; and the other for those who were married and honestly employed, like Kṛṣṇa’s friend Arjuna. Both paths were good, but the question for Prabhupāda was which path his disciples should take. If they attempted to take the path of ascetics like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, they would probably remain hippies, and Prabhupāda wanted many big centers with respectable guests coming to takeprasādam.Yet if to maintain such temples the devotees had to engage inugra-karma,then who would preach? It was a puzzle.\n“I have either to stop this brahminical system,” Prabhupāda said, “or I have to havebrāhmaṇaswork.” He thought of starting his own business; he had had a little capital, and there was organization. Then he thought of enlisting the support of the Indians in Montreal.\nMontreal had a large Indian community, and families were already attending the Sunday feast at the temple. Of those who came forward to meet Prabhupāda, the most promising was young Gopal Khana, a business major at McGill University. Although raised in an orthodox Hindu family, Gopal knew little of the Vaiṣṇava philosophy.\nThe day before Śrīla Prabhupāda had arrived in Montreal, Gopal had received an invitation card from a devotee. Because for the past year Gopal had been seriously wanting to understand God, he had been interested. In his spiritual search he had been attending services at a Hindu temple in Toronto as well as visiting various other churches and temples; he had given up meat-eating and smoking. On coming to the temple and seeing the excitement of the devotees in preparing for Prabhupāda’s arrival, Gopal had asked to help, so one of the devotees had instructed him to help clean Prabhupāda’s apartment. Prabhupāda had taken an interest in Gopal, who, although he had never met asādhubefore and didn’t know what to think at first, respected Prabhupāda.\nA friend of Gopal’s, a Mr. Mukerjee from Calcutta, also began attending Prabhupāda’s lectures. Mr. Mukerjee, who claimed to have spiritual knowledge, told Gopal that, although he had touched the feet of many Indiansādhusthroughout India, never had he met anyone as saintly as Prabhupāda. Gopal took his friend’s endorsement of Prabhupāda very seriously, and soon he was attending all the lectures in the temple and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa on his beads, acting like a regular devotee. He would usually be the only Indian to remain through thekīrtanaand lecture in the temple. Then afterwards he would stay and have hot milk with the devotees, returning home around nine-thirty.\nAssociating with the devotees and being of the same age as they, Gopal automatically included himself among the intimate disciples who regularly visited Prabhupāda at his apartment. Prabhupāda asked Gopal about his family and background in India and encouraged him to take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When Gopal told Prabhupāda that he had been chantingoṁ,Prabhupāda explained that by itselfoṁwas incomplete. If he wanted to chantoṁ,Prabhupāda said, then he should chantoṁ kṛṣṇa.\nOne night Gopal was present as Prabhupāda discussed the financial problems of the Montreal temple. Although the temple rent was only $150 and expenses were minimal, the devotees were struggling. At one point in the discussion Prabhupāda turned to Gopal and asked, “So, Gopal, what is your solution to this financial problem?” Guessing that Prabhupāda might be hinting for him to contribute money, Gopal said he didn’t have a solution.\nPrabhupāda lectured at a nearby Christian school, and Gopal and his friend Mr. Mukerjee attended. When, after thekīrtanaand lecture, Prabhupāda asked if there were any questions, Mr. Mukerjee raised his hand, stood up, and, to the shock of the devotees, began insulting Prabhupāda.\n“It is not a fact that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,” Mr. Mukerjee said before the hall filled with Christian students and ministers. “You should not speak like this in a church. Why do you say that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme and that we should surrender to Him?”\nPrabhupāda remained calm. Although the attending devotees, looking furiously at Mr. Mukerjee, could barely restrain themselves, Prabhupāda didn’t even speak. He simply called on someone else in the audience and allowed the unpleasant event to pass.\nSome days later Prabhupāda asked Gopal about Mr. Mukerjee, who hadn’t come by recently. To Gopal’s surprise, Prabhupāda asked to see Mr. Mukerjee again. Gopal, considering Mr. Mukerjee too envious and blasphemous, advised Prabhupāda against it. “No, it does not matter,” Prabhupāda said. “I must have done something against him in my past life, and now he has taken his revenge. Please call him.”\nGradually some of the Indian visitors responded to Śrīla Prabhupāda and began to give money to support the temple. Most of them, however, were reluctant to spend money or time apart from their careers and families. Indian culture, Prabhupāda said, had completely fallen, due partly to foreign invasions into India and partly to India’s leaders’ madly abandoning their original culture in favor of Western materialism. “But still,” Prabhupāda told the devotees, “if there is any civilization left anywhere, it is in India. In India they are all originally Kṛṣṇa conscious, and with a little chanting and takingprasādamtheir material covering can be removed.”\nPrabhupāda compared modern-day Indian civilization to a dead elephant. An elephant is such a valuable creature that even when dead, because of its tusks and hide, it remains almost as valuable as when alive and working. Similarly, although the Indian culture was practically dead, India still had great potential. Most Indians in the villages still retained a simple faith that their present suffering was due tokarmaof their past lives and that they would have to transmigrate to another body in their next life. That basic transcendental knowledge, commonly understood by the Indian masses, was unknown in the West even to the most sophisticated and advanced members of society.\nBut Prabhupāda was sorry to see the Indians in the West abandoning their piety and taking the cheap life of sense gratification. He compared the Indian immigrants to the “new crows.” When crows eat garbage, after a while they are full. But if a new crow arrives, he becomes especially eager. Similarly, many Indians, newly arrived in the West, were more eager for material advancement than the Westerners. Yet despite Prabhupāda’s criticism of Indians, whenever he met anyone of Indian birth – in the temple, in his room, or elsewhere – he seemed to become especially sympathetic and friendly, conversing with them in Hindi or Bengali as if talking with old, familiar friends.\nJanārdana was concerned about presenting Kṛṣṇa consciousness to Montreal’s main religious contingent, the Catholics. Because he came from a French-Canadian Catholic family, Janārdana thought Prabhupāda and his disciples should learn to present Kṛṣṇa consciousness in terms of Biblical teachings. It was possible, Prabhupāda agreed, but it would require great expertise. It would be better, he said, to stress the universal, nonsectarian nature of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and all other religions had some idea of God, though not much realization of pure love for God. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, was like a postgraduate study for persons of all religions. Prabhupāda requested his disciples not to divert their attention to criticizing the Christian or any other sectarian faith. Rather, they should simply preachBhagavad-gītāandŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nWhen Śivānanda and Nanda-kiśora brought an Indian Christian to Prabhupāda’s apartment, Prabhupāda demonstrated the art of preaching to a committed follower of a sectarian religious faith. “We don’t say you have to be this religion or that,” Prabhupāda told the man. “The real test of religion is how one is awakening his dormant love for God.” Prabhupāda went on – without attacking the man’s religious affiliation – to describe the degradation of Kali-yuga. “At the present moment,” he said, “never mind whether one is Christian, Hindu, Jew, or Muslim, most people are godless and don’t care for God. They simply take an official stand. But actually, in the depth of their heart, they have no idea what God is. If a Christian believes in God, let him love God more prominently than matter.” The man agreed.\nJanārdana took Prabhupāda to see some of the great cathedrals in Montreal. Entering the spacious Notre Dame, Prabhupāda said, “Yes, this is worship of God as Lord Nārāyaṇa – in awe and reverence.” The church tour impressed Śrīla Prabhupāda, and the next day he revealed his thoughts in a letter to Aniruddha.\nPrabhupāda and Janārdana visited another church, which displayed the relics of a saint who had been adept at healing. Walking through the exhibit of the saint’s clothing, desk, bed, and personal effects, Prabhupāda was unimpressed. “Just see,” he said. “They are adoring him for healing bodies that are now dead. But they do not take interest in the healing of a soul in his eternal situation.”\nQuestions about Christ and the Bible often arose after Prabhupāda’s classes in the temple. One night Prabhupāda explained that even the most learned man studies in terms of the body only. Although a person may have many Ph.D.’s and may be talking philosophy, when he is asked, “Do you know what the soul is?” he will stop.\nA man raised his hand. “I have here a Holy Bible,” he began. “Yes,” Prabhupāda acknowledged.\n“So the Holy Bible is also written by the Holy Spirit of mankind. Should we believe in the Bible or not?”\n“You can say it is written by mankind, but so far as I know, those who wrote, wrote with revelation.”\n“The Holy Spirit?”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said. “Therefore, you should read. Otherwise, if a man writes a book on his own, he will write on his own experience. And it will be imperfect.”\n“You were speaking about men only knowing the body. What about the body of Christ?”\n“Body of Christ is not ordinary body,” Prabhupāda said. “That is spiritual body. Kṛṣṇa says in theBhagavad-gītā:sambhavāmy-ātma-māyayā.So this is a very subtle point. One has to understand that when God comes or God’s son comes or God’s representative comes, they do not accept a body like us. They have their spiritual body.”\n“Kṛṣṇa means Christ,” the man replied. “He’s the whole spirit. So we are also in the body of man. That is the body of God?”\n“No,” Prabhupāda replied. “The body of man is not exactly the body of God. With God there is no difference between the body and the soul because He is all-spiritual. Just like if you have a golden body and a golden soul – then there is no difference between the soul and the body. But in our case, as we are, we are spirit soul, but the body is material. Therefore I am different from this body. But when we are liberated, we get a spiritual body like Kṛṣṇa’s. At the present moment there is a difference between our body and soul. Therefore, as soon as a soul goes away from the body, the body, being matter – ‘Dust thou art, dust thou be-est’ – mixes with the matter, and the soul takes another body. The whole problem is that we have to stop repetition of migration from one material body to another material body. That is the highest perfection of life.”\nIn his letter, Prabhupāda explained his personal background and mission. He then defined love of God (as it is explained inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam) and stated that human life is especially meant for learning to love God. Noting that people were mostly interested in sense gratification, Prabhupāda remarked, “This tendency is very much deteriorating. Because Your Holiness is the Head of a great religious sect, I think we should meet together and chalk out a program for cooperation.”\nPrabhupāda went on to describe some of the symptoms of society as degradation, including the pro-abortion movement within the Catholic faith. “I understand it from reliable sources,” Prabhupāda wrote, “that people are trying to get Your Holiness’s sanction for contraceptive method, which is certainly against any religion of the world. In the Hindu religion, such contraceptive method or abortion is considered equivalent to murder.” Prabhupāda said the same degradation was affecting India, and he suggested that the guardians of society treat this situation as a very serious one. Prabhupāda closed his letter, “If you think that a meeting with You will be beneficial for the human society at large, I shall be very much pleased if Your Holiness will grant me an interview.”\nJanārdana mixed with many liberal, academic religionists interested in ecumenical aspects of religion, and he wanted to introduce Prabhupāda to these scholars of various faiths. He arranged a private get-together at a friend’s house, and Prabhupāda very willingly went and spoke about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The next day he summarized his experience in a letter to Satsvarūpa.\nPrabhupāda attended a more formal ecumenical meeting, a religious conference. About fifty people, including Prabhupāda and a group of his devotees, attended. A panel, representing various religions, honored Prabhupāda as the main speaker as well as a member of the panel. Prabhupāda lectured. After the lecture, a Catholic priest asked how Prabhupāda could be so sure of his statements about God.\n“Why not?” Prabhupāda said. “What is the difficulty? I have consciousness. There is God. Now I have forgotten Him. I have to revive my consciousness of God. What is difficult in knowing that much?” The questioners were not his submissive young disciples, and this was not Prabhupāda relaxed and sitting back on a pillow in his room. He was alert, logical, and very sociable. But some of the panel were not satisfied with his presentation. The moderator took up their cause.\nModerator: “Are you saying that you are perfect?”\nPrabhupāda: “I am imperfect – that’s all right. But I know what is perfection.”\nModerator: “But I cannot see that.”\nPrabhupāda’s disciples laughed at this, and Prabhupāda turned to reprimand them: “Don’t laugh.” Then returning to his debate with the moderator: “Therefore, you are here. You have to go to London. If you have purchased a ticket for London and if you have gotten to the airplane, so even if you have not gone to London, you are sure that you are going to London.”\nModerator: “Yes, I can be sure. I understand that. I have no doubt about that. But how can your security – ”\nPrabhupāda: “No, no. If I have understood that my destination is London, I feel secure that I am going to London. Then that is my happiness.”\nModerator: “So you are completely happy.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, because I know that if I go to London I will be happy. And I am going there.”\nModerator: “But you’re not in London yet.”\nPrabhupāda: “That’s all right!”Prabhupāda raised his voice confidently. “I have already told you that when you purchase a ticket and you understand that you are surely going to London – that is happiness.”\nModerator: “But then there is no question.”\nPrabhupāda: “Hmm? But what is this? If my destination is London, why then question? There is no need of question.”\nModerator: “Well, then why a conference with men of other religions?” The other panel members listened intently as the moderator pursued a line of argument many of them empathized with. They wanted to see Prabhupāda defeated.\nPrabhupāda: “That conference is used to consult together that London is the destination.”\nModerator: “But then you know the destination.”\nPrabhupāda: “Right.”\nModerator: “The idea that you have behind your mind is to tell other people where the destination is.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes.”\nModerator: “Not to search for it with them.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, I don’t say search. I have already searched out.”\nModerator: “Yeah. So then I feel myself that this is not a conference.”\nPrabhupāda: “Hmm? Then if I have got some good news to tell you, it is not conference?” Prabhupāda’s disciples burst into laughter despite themselves. This time Prabhupāda did not check them. He was too busy, too alert with the debate, as several persons started talking at once.\nPanel member: “As far as you are concerned, it may be London. As far as I am concerned, it may be Paris or Hawaii.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, then we have to consider where is real happiness, whether it is in Hawaii or in Paris or – ”\nModerator: “You! But if you are not willing to concede” – the moderator could not help becoming accusative in his tone – “that it is not London, and if I say I am not going to that place – ”\nPrabhupāda: “That is going on, that is going on. There are innumerable planets, and in theBhagavad-gītāit is said:yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ.So if you think that London is not good for you, Paris is good for you, then it is good for you.”\nAnother panel member (with a German accent): “Well, therefore, conference is all useless.”\nPrabhupāda: “No. If you don’t agree, if you do not understand what is the highest goal, then conference is useless. If you keep yourself to the understanding where you are, then there is no need of conference.” Several persons, some on the panel and some even in the audience, began to speak at once in protest of Prabhupāda’s remarks.\nPrabhupāda: “That is conference – I want to convince you that London is the real place of happiness.”\nModerator: “ButIthink that I know better than you.”\nPrabhupāda: “You may think, but you have to be convinced that your thinking is wrong.”\nModerator: “Or maybe I can convince you thatyourthinking is wrong.”\nPrabhupāda: “That’s all right. Therefore, conference is required.” Prabhupāda began to laugh. Finally everyone laughed, and the tension that had been building to animosity relaxed. But the formal order of the conference had been lost, and now everyone began to speak at once.\nModerator: “Excuse me, Swamiji, but the time is running out … ”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes.”\nModerator: “And I would like to thank you very much for coming.”\nPrabhupāda: “Now you are convinced that conference is required?”\nModerator: “Yes.”\nPrabhupāda: “You have to convince me, and I will have to convince you.”\nModerator: “And I think that’s true. These confrontations, these listenings, lead to further understanding.”\nThe program ended, and the crowd began dispersing, talking among themselves, moving out into the summer evening. The moderator, still intellectually piqued by Prabhupāda’s brand of ecumenicity, approached Prabhupāda amid the crowd moving toward the exit.\n“The question is,” the young minister pursued, “where should we go, if you believe that you must go to London, yet I believe very strongly I must go to India, and I am convinced that, at least for me, India is wonderful?”\nPrabhupāda: “No. If you are convinced that going to India is good for you, so similarly you must accept that going to London is also nice.”\nMinister: “Yes. But so may you also be convinced that India is better than London.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, if you can convince me.”\nMinister: “But if you believe that you cannot be convinced … ”\nPrabhupāda: “No. You can convince if we are reasonable.”\nMinister: “But then we have to search together to become complete.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, my version is complete.”\nMinister: “Then I cannot convince you of anything.”\nPrabhupāda: “No. Why not? You have got reason, I have got reason. You have to show me that there are favorable conditions in Paris or India … ”\nMinister: “But how can I convince you, because you say that you cannot – ”\nPrabhupāda: “No, no, no, no. Convince means you have to convince me with your reasoning power of presentation.”\nAugust 1968Śrīla Prabhupāda was in his room with several devotees.\n“Prabhupāda?” Śivānanda asked.\n“Yes.”\n“May I go to England?” Śivānanda had asked once before, and Prabhupāda had told him no, that he should stay in Montreal and help. He was only twenty, and his desire to go seemed to be mostly restlessness. He was sincere but inexperienced. But now he was asking again – and it was timely.\n“My mother will give me money for the trip,” Śivānanda continued. “She says it’ll be all right as long as I go back to college after opening a temple there.”\nPrabhupāda nodded. “Yes, that’s all right. You can go. You are sincere. But be careful. I was an old Calcutta boy, and so when I came to New York I never got cheated.”\nPrabhupāda’s spiritual master, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, had wanted to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Europe. He had sent his most experiencedsannyāsīs,giving them financial support from India; but they had returned, accomplishing nothing. Perhaps these boys and girls could succeed where others had failed. Prabhupāda felt it was possible. He knew it would greatly please Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.\nPrabhupāda had faith that his disciples would be able to establish something in Europe, just as they had done in America. He gave the example that if someone finds a gourd lying on the road and picks it up and finds a wire and picks that up, although the two parts are in themselves useless, if he puts them together to make avīṇā,he could play beautiful music. Similarly, Prabhupāda had come and found some hippies lying here and there, and he himself had been rejected by the people in New York City; but by Kṛṣṇa’s grace it had become a successful combination. If his disciples remained sincere and followed his orders, then they would be successful in Europe.\nWhen the three married couples – Mukunda and Jānakī, Śyāmasundara and Mālatī, and Gurudāsa and Yamunā – arrived in Montreal, they created a new enthusiasm in the temple. These three couples had begun the temple in San Francisco and had had close association with Prabhupāda. They had helped Prabhupāda makekīrtana,feasting, and Ratha-yātrā successful among the hippies of Haight-Ashbury. Now they were eager to help Prabhupāda bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to London.\nIt was an emotional reunion. Jānakī began crying, and Prabhupāda patted her head, saying, “There is no need.” When Prabhupāda saw Sarasvatī, Śyāmasundara and Mālatī’s daughter, he said, “I dreamed of that child last night, that exact child.” And he took the baby in his arms and gave her his garland. Prabhupāda laughed. “They will say, ‘What kind ofsannyāsīis he?’ ”\nPrabhupāda wanted these three couples to stay with him for a week or two so that he could train them to performkīrtanavery expertly. Of course, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa was not a theatrical performance; it was an act of devotion. In fact, it could only be properly done by pure devotees – not by professional musicians. Yet if these disciples could learn the standard tunes and practice singing together, Londoners would better appreciate Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nPrabhupāda wanted to teach his London-bound disciples to sing and play instruments in a specific way. Someone should learn to play the harmonium properly – following the melody, not simply pumping it, as the devotees had been doing for years. And the Sanskritmantrasandbhajanasshould be pronounced properly and the melodies sung correctly. Some melodies were to be sung in the morning, others in the evening. Each word was to be pronounced correctly and with the right intonation.\nPrabhupāda liked Yamunā’s singing, and Mukunda was an expert musician for organizing the party. The spacious Montreal temple was a suitable place for them to practice. Ideally, Prabhupāda said, the party should have twomṛdaṅgaplayers, one harmonium player, one tamboura player, and at least sixkaratālaplayers. He talked about sending the group not only to London but to the European continent and then to Asia also. So he wanted them to become expert atkīrtana.\n“Can we put on plays and things like that?” Gurudāsa asked.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda said, “you can put on plays in the street with a Lord Nṛsiṁha mask and costumes and wigs. Or one boy can be dressed as Lord Caitanya, another as Lord Nityānanda, Gadādhara, Advaita with a white beard, and Śrīvāsa.”\nPrabhupāda became ecstatic at the thought of his disciples performingkīrtanain England. They would become more popular than theyogīswith their gymnastics and impersonal meditation. Sometimes they could dramatize scenes fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,sometimes they could recite Sanskrit verses and explain them by singing in English. Now that the London program was a tangible fact, Prabhupāda voiced one visionary plan after another. To the devotees it seemed that Prabhupāda had already thought out in detail hundreds of plans for implementing Kṛṣṇa consciousness around the world and that all he needed were some willing helpers.\nPrabhupāda began holding dailykīrtanarehearsals, teaching the devotees to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, very slowly at first, gradually building the tempo. Regularly he would interrupt and have them begin again. As Yamunā led the singing, Prabhupāda would listen carefully, stopping her at times to correct her Sanskrit pronunciation.\nThe six London-bound devotees had arrived in Montreal only a few days before two of the biggest festival days of the year: Janmāṣṭamī, the appearance day of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and Vyāsa-pūjā, the appearance day of Śrīla Prabhupāda. Now, with the festival days approaching and devotees from other cities arriving to be with Prabhupāda, the usually quiet Montreal temple began to stir with activity. Cooking became so enthusiastic that it was like a bigkīrtanain the kitchen. Prabhupāda supervised the cooking of some of the preparations and then returned to his apartment, where he personally cooked several special dishes.\nThe Janmāṣṭamī festival was scheduled to last all day and on through the night until midnight, the time of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s appearance, culminating in a midnight feast. Gopal had mailed invitations to many Indians and had made hundreds of phone calls. As a result, more than three hundred guests attended. Prabhupāda spoke in the evening before a distracted, talkative audience of Indian families with children. Afterwards he had Gaurasundara, Mukunda, and Yamunā speak in turn. Pleased by the large gathering of guests and devotees in the bowling-alley-turned-temple, Prabhupāda considered the Janmāṣṭamī festival the high point of his stay in Montreal.\nAfter the midnight feasting, as Prabhupāda was leaving the temple, he stopped at the door and turned to Haṁsadūta, who had done most of the cooking. “The sweetballs were very good,” Prabhupāda said.\n“Thank you, Prabhupāda.”\n“But mine,” Prabhupāda smiled, “were better.”\nThe next day, Prabhupāda’s appearance day, the devotees gathered again, fasting until noon and then feasting. In the morning they offered little speeches in praise of their spiritual master. After most of the disciples had spoken, Prabhupāda turned to a new boy and indicated that he should speak. The boy stood and said that although he didn’t know much about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he was serving Prabhupāda each day by rollingcapātīsin the kitchen. He said he loved hearing Prabhupāda’s taped lectures and rollingcapātīsand that he was satisfied and happy and simply wanted to go on eternally rollingcapātīsand hearing his spiritual master’s tapes. This simple talk caused Prabhupāda to smile, and he thanked the boy for his realization.\nThen Prabhupāda spoke, describing the spiritual master as a transcendental broker. The broker acts only on behalf of his firm, and the customer must deal with the firm through the broker. Approaching Kṛṣṇa through the spiritual master was like that.\nThe London party, now ready to go, went for a final meeting with Prabhupāda. He was sending them to start a center in London and thus fulfill his spiritual master’s dream. ThesannyāsīsŚrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had sent to London had lectured in a few places, posed for photos with lords and ladies, and then returned to India. But Prabhupāda said his disciples should boldly go out and chant the holy name and attract others to chant. Then, when those persons were practiced at chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, they could continue on their own, and the devotees could move on to another place and chant. Prabhupāda was enthusiastic about London, and as he spoke he filled his disciples with the same enthusiasm.\nWhen Mukunda asked Prabhupāda if he had any specific instructions, he replied with a story. In his youth, Prabhupāda said, he had seen a movie of Charlie Chaplin. The setting was a formal ball held outdoors, and off from the main dance arena were lanes with benches where couples sat. Some mischievous boys plastered glue on a bench, and a young man and his girlfriend came and sat down. “When the young man got up” –  Prabhupāda laughed as he told the story, and his disciples, who could hardly believe their ears, were also laughing – “his tailing coats tore up the middle.”\nThe man and woman didn’t notice what had happened and returned to the dance, where they began to draw stares from the other dancers. Wondering why he was suddenly drawing so much attention, the young man went into the dressing room and saw in the mirror that his coattails were torn. Deliberately, he then tore his jacket all the way up to the collar, returned to his partner, and began dancing exuberantly.\nThen another man decided to get into the spirit and, ripping his own coattails, began dancing with his partner almost in competition with the first couple. One by one, the other dancers all followed suit, ripping their coattails and dancing with abandon.\nBy the time Prabhupāda finished the story, the devotees in his room were all laughing, forgetting everything else. Then, as the laughter subsided and the meeting drew to an end, Mālatī asked, “Prabhupāda, I don’t think we can go to London unless we have the shelter of your lotus feet. May we kiss your lotus feet?”\nThe other devotees were taken aback at her sudden request. No one had ever done such a thing before. But neither her husband nor the others said anything to oppose her, and Prabhupāda consented. One by one, the six London-bound preachers came and offered their obeisances, kissing the bottom of their spiritual master’s feet.\nNot until the devotees were already at the airport did Mukunda, talking with Śyāmasundara, begin to appreciate and marvel that Prabhupāda had expertly answered his question by telling the story of the ripped coattails.\nMukunda:I realized that Prabhupāda was telling us that preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness may be difficult or unpopular in England at first. But if we preached boldly, enthusiastically, and purely, then everyone would follow."

        "chapter_title": "Seattle",
        "content": "September 21, 1968\nTHE IMMEDIATE REASON Śrīla Prabhupāda went to Seattle was that two of his disciples, Upendra and Gargamuni, had just begun an ISKCON center there and had invited him. For several years, this had been Prabhupāda’s method of spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness in America: he went to a city, stayed, preached, and directed his disciples. He had done so in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Montreal, Los Angeles – all with good success. As he had written in a letter of March 1968, “We want to open hundreds of centers so that people may take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And we need many enthusiastic boys and girls for carrying on this great mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.”\nPrabhupāda’s Guru Mahārāja, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, had not mentioned Seattle or even the United States when he ordered Prabhupāda to preach in the Western countries. But Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu had said the chanting of the Lord’s holy names, Hare Kṛṣṇa, would go to every town and village of the world. The street chanters andBack to Godheadmagazine distributors in Los Angeles and San Francisco wanted to try Seattle to test the chanting in the streets of a conservative city. Seattle, the home of Boeing Aircraft Manufacturers, had a population of 560,000, a university, and several good colleges. On Prabhupāda’s order, the devotees went ahead to join the Seattle temple in time for Prabhupāda’s arrival.\nWhile Gargamuni was still desperately trying to find an apartment he could afford, the devotees received Prabhupāda in a hotel room. From Prabhupāda’s room, the window looked out at the six-hundred-foot-tall Space Needle and the monorail – leftovers from the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair. The devotees squeezed into the small room as Prabhupāda sat behind a low desk and pulled his harmonium to him. “Should I play?” he asked, smiling. They pleaded,“Yes!” and he began playing, the fingers of his right hand moving deftly across the keyboard, while his left hand pumped the harmonium’s bellows. He sang,gaurāṅga balite habe pulaka-śarīra / hari hari balite nayane babe nīra.Their meeting with him in the room was happy, but the song was not a light thing. The sound poured forth, both from him and from the little harmonium. They werebhajanas,he had explained to them, songs of devotion, this one by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura: “When will the time come when, while chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, there will be tears in the eyes?” He played, and the expression of his face in singing seemed like crying. The song, he said, meant, “When the mind is completely purified, freed from material anxieties and desires, then I shall be able to understand Vṛndāvana and the love of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa; and then my spiritual life will be successful.”\nThe first night in town, Prabhupāda was to drive from the hotel to the ISKCON temple, a house rented by the devotees in a quiet suburban neighborhood. A devotee-carpenter, Nara-Nārāyaṇa, had done excellent work with $50 converting the living room into a temple room. Enclosed behind long red satin curtains was an impressive three-tiered altar. The altar was paneled with the same cedar as the walls. The altar’s bottom shelf had a brass incense holder, brass flower vases, two silver double candle holders, a conchshell, and a picture of Lord Viṣṇu. On the middle shelf were a black-and-white close-up of Prabhupāda, a large color poster of Lord Caitanya, and a simple ink drawing of the Pañca-tattva by Prabhupāda’s disciples Gaurasundara and Govinda dāsī. The top shelf held the twelve-inch deities of Lord Jagannātha, Subhadrā and Lord Baladeva, who were clothed in simple golden satin, without jewels or garlands.\nAround the room were nicely framed pictures. To the left of the altar was an Indian print of Gopāla with His arm around a calf. Forming a border near the ceiling were several of Gurudāsa’s captivating black-and-white close-ups of Śrīla Prabhupāda on morning walks in San Francisco. On the left wall was a painting of Kṛṣṇa driving Arjuna’s chariot. To the right of the altar was Śrīla Prabhupāda’svyāsāsana.\nThe room was small. The devotees had designed avyāsāsana,three feet high, wedged into the corner so that the room could accommodate many people. The back of the seat was cushioned with deep blue velvet inset with large and decorative golden upholstery buttons. The seat itself was gold velvet, with a gold bolster pillow. A small gold velvet canopy with a fringe hung above thevyāsāsana.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda arrived at the temple accompanied by his servant, Kartikeya, and his secretary, Govinda dāsī. Coming up the steps onto the porch, they were greeted at the front door by the welcomingkīrtanaof the devotees in the small temple room. As Śrīla Prabhupāda made his way from the door toward hisvyāsāsana,all the devotees in the room except for one bowed down. The exception, standing midway between the front door and thevyāsāsana,was a newcomer, a girl named Joy Fulcher, who had only met the devotees that very day. And as Śrīla Prabhupāda passed by her, she also bowed down.\nAs Śrīla Prabhupāda was taking his seat on thevyāsāsana,while Kartikeya adjusted the microphone and Govinda dāsī adjusted the tape recorder, the devotees sent Joy forward to offer Prabhupāda a garland of red roses and red carnations. Joy had made the garland, stringing the flowers in a symmetrical pattern. But when she placed it around Prabhupāda’s neck, the garland fell asymmetrically. Feeling undone, she turned to go sit down. “Thank you very much,” said Prabhupāda in a soft but deeply resounding voice.\nJoy Fulcher:So I sat down and listened to his lecture. But I could not understand his accent. I was struck with the impression that here was a very elderly person who had taken great difficulty to come and speak to us. I could understand there was nothing motivating in it for him. I felt very much that he didn’t want to cheat me. I also had the conception that this person was inconceivably humble, because of his quoting the scriptures, because of his references to his Guru Mahārāja, and because of his general attitude and his soft-spoken voice. I could understand that he was not trying to impress anyone and that he was very humble and dependent on his Guru Mahārāja.\nAfter the lecture, I raised my hand to ask a question. Answering three or four questions first, he finally took my question. I asked him, “Śrī Bhaktivedanta, how is it that this universal presence which is humanly inconceivable, at least to me, at this time …, how can it have the form of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa?” The devotees had preached to me, prior to his arrival, that the Absolute Truth, which I, from my reading inyogaphilosophy, impersonally called “universal presence,” was actually Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His consort, Rādhārāṇī.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda very distinctly answered, “By His mercy.” But then he spoke loudly, “You cannot make the sun rise, and similarly you cannot make God appear before you to answer your doubts!”\nI was thunderstruck that he chose this particular example, since only four months earlier I had climbed a mountain by myself and sat there all night waiting for dawn, when I would “make the sun rise.” But when dawn came, it was a cloudy day, and so, of course, I did not make the sun rise. The fact that out of all examples Prabhupāda chose that particular thing to answer me hit me like a thunderbolt.\nThen His Divine Grace softened his voice, like a rose, and indicating his disciples with a wave of his arm, he said, “But you just associate with these nice boys and girls here, chant this Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,eatkṛṣṇa-prasādam,study my books scrutinizingly, and engage yourself in a little service, and then the Lord will reveal Himself to you from within your heart, in His own time, by His own sweet will, with all His name, fame, form, pastimes, paraphernalia, and entourage.”\nWithin a few days, Gargamuni found an inexpensive two-room apartment for Prabhupāda. Gargamuni, who was accustomed to the Lower East Side of New York City, thought this Seattle apartment a good bargain. By New York slum standards it wasn’t bad, but there were much better places in Seattle.\nWhen Prabhupāda entered with the devotees, it became obvious to everyone that the apartment was a disaster. Prabhupāda went to the windows and looked out – at the brick wall of the building six feet away. Because of this building, no sunlight could enter the room. Prabhupāda looked below at the dark, dingy alley littered with garbage. The curtains in the room reached only half way down the wall, the tiles were peeling in the bathroom, nothing was clean, and there was no bed. Anyone staying with Prabhupāda would have to walk through his room to reach the bathroom. Only when Prabhupāda entered, with his bright, transcendental presence, could his disciples fully understand that the apartment was not at all suitable. Prabhupāda, however, didn’t complain. “It doesn’t matter,” he said. And taking hiscādaraand placing it on the floor, he sat down.\nAlthough the neighborhood was noisy, Prabhupāda was tolerant. But he admitted, “This place is not nice.” And then, looking up at the devotees in the dingy room, he asked, “Why have you put me in this dungeon?” Struck at heart by these words, the devotees knew they had to find a better place, and several of them went out to search.\nWhy had they put him in a dungeon?Jayānanda, Nara-Nārāyaṇa, and Govinda dāsī got into the van and drove off, vowing not to return until they found a place Prabhupāda would like. They moved toward the Capitol Hill area and finally found a “For Rent” sign on the lawn of a nice house situated near a lake. Although it was a basement apartment, the many ground-level windows made the rooms bright and sunny. Jayānanda and Govinda dāsī talked to the landlord, and Prabhupāda moved in the next day.\nHe liked the tulips lining his windows and the view down the sloping green lawn to the shore of the lake. He liked walking in the backyard, from where he could see boats passing. “That other place,” he chuckled, “was like being in the womb of the mother, and this place is like coming out into the world and seeing the light.” The apartment was well furnished, and Prabhupāda put his Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities on a dresser before the mirror, which made a nice backdrop.\nEarly every morning Prabhupāda would go on a walk, usually to Volunteer Park, where he walked by the reservoir. The path around the reservoir’s perimeter was several miles long, and although some of the young men would become exhausted from the walk, Prabhupāda enjoyed it. One morning, while Jayānanda was walking with Prabhupāda, they approached a man who had just pulled a fish out of the water. The fisherman held up his catch, dangling it as if offering it to Prabhupāda. “Anyone for a fish dinner?” the man asked cheerily. Prabhupāda smiled, “No, you enjoy.” Prabhupāda kept walking until he was past the man and then added, “And suffer.”\nThey also walked in an area filled with many rose bushes and many birds. Peacocks roamed freely. It is written in theśāstrasthat wherever a saintly person goes becomes atīrtha,or a place of pilgrimage. In India are manytīrthas,most of which are places where the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His great devotees enacted somelīlā.There are no suchtīrthas,however, in America. But after Prabhupāda’s preaching – beginning in New York City in places like 26 Second Avenue and Tompkins Square Park, and later in Golden Gate Park, at Stowe Lake, Venice Beach, or Volunteer Park – then even these American places became, for Prabhupāda’s followers, significant, never-to-be-forgotten sites.\nPrabhupāda took advantage of the presence of the travelingsaṅkīrtanaparty in Seattle. He told Tamāla Kṛṣṇa he wanted to organize a worldsaṅkīrtanaparty, with twelve men, twelve women, and himself going all over the world. But for the present, the devotees went out daily in the downtown city. In Seattle, citizens were astounded to see young Americans with shaven heads, saffron robes, women insārīs,playing cymbals and singing “Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare.” The devotees would chant Hare Kṛṣṇa for hours, give out cards with themahā-mantraprinted on them, and sometimes bring people back to the temple. As a result, attendance was good at Prabhupāda’s evening lectures. With the devotees chanting on the streets during the day and Prabhupāda speaking at night, the city was quickly becoming spiritualized. Therefore, each evening the small cedarwood-paneled temple room of Lord Jagannātha was filled with considerable transcendental excitement. For Prabhupāda, it was very encouraging to lecture to a hall crowded with both disciples and guests.\nAfter the eveningkīrtana,everyone would sit down on the floor, and some people would even stand outside the house, looking in and listening at the windows. Prabhupāda invariably began by chanting, in a strong, simple melody, the refraingovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.And everyone would repeat in chorus,govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.He would chant it half a dozen times and then begin his lecture.\nPrabhupāda’sTeachings of Lord Caitanyahad recently been published, and he often lectured by having a devotee read out loud. Prabhupāda would listen, and whenever he felt moved to, he would interrupt and begin speaking. “This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement,” Prabhupāda explained, “has to be understood through the teachings of Lord Caitanya. He appeared in Bengal, a province in India, five hundred years ago. And He specifically preached the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. To execute that order we have come to your country. My request is that you try to understand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement with all your knowledge, scrutinizingly. Don’t accept it blindly. We have this bookTeachings of Lord Caitanya,and other books also, many books. So try to read them. And we have our magazineBack to Godhead.We are not sentimentalists that we are simply dancing. Dancing has got great value. That, if you dance with us, you will feel. It is not that some crazy fellows are dancing. The most intelligent persons are dancing, and yet it is so nicely made that even a boy like here, he is a boy, he can take part.”\nPrabhupāda emphasized that Kṛṣṇa consciousness was universal. It was full of sound philosophy, and yet it was very simple. The simple message was, “God is great, and we are His part and parcel.” And to prove it, he gave simple examples: The hand is part of the body and has great value when working as part of the whole. A small screw in the typewriting machine is very valuable as long as it is working as part of the machine; otherwise it is useless. Similarly, unless the individual spirit soul engages in devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, he is incomplete.\nPrabhupāda spoke some basic Kṛṣṇa consciousness for about a half-hour and then asked for questions. Always at least a few hands raised. He recognized the outsiders first. It was not unusual in those days to find young people, college students and hippies, asking cosmic questions, dabbling inyogaand Eastern philosophy. Often, however, they had many different things on their minds, including drugs, and were frequently confused. But Prabhupāda, experienced with over three years of constant preaching to young Americans, had already heard almost anything they could possibly ask.\nYoung man: “Is there a communication that is not the word itself but beyond words, perhaps a vibration reaching for theoṁ? I mean, does one attain a communication, something understood between you and myself and my brother, an experience like the sounddongoraung? Isthere something else beyond the verbal?”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied, “this Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nMan: “Hare Kṛṣṇa?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes.”\nMan: “But can you tell me how this can be? How to talk that language all the time rather than English or other languages?”\nPrabhupāda: “It doesn’t matter that Hare Kṛṣṇa can be sounded in Sanskrit only. You can sound it in English tone also, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Is there any difficulty? These boys are also sounding Hare Kṛṣṇa. Just like the piano. If you touch, there isdung.It doesn’t matter whether an American is striking or an Indian striking or a Hindu striking or a Muslim striking, the sound is sound. Similarly, this piano, Hare Kṛṣṇa, you just touch it and it will sound. That’s all.”\nSomeone asked about meditation.\nPrabhupāda asked, “What do you mean by meditation?”\n“Sitting alone quietly.”\n“How is it possible?” Prabhupāda asked. “Is there any experience that the mind is not acting when you sit silently? You have to engage your mind in something.”\n“What do you engage it in?”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied. “That is Kṛṣṇa. We engage our mind in Kṛṣṇa, the beautiful Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not only simply engaging the mind, but engaging the mind in action with the senses. Because mind is acting with our senses. Your mind said, ‘Let us go to that newly started ISKCON society.’ So your legs carried you here. So mind – thinking, feeling, willing – these are the functions of the mind. You have to fix up your mind not only thinking of Kṛṣṇa, but also working for Kṛṣṇa, feeling for Kṛṣṇa. That is complete meditation.”\nSomeone asked if a Christian, by reading the Bible and following Jesus’s words, required a spiritual master. As soon as you read the Bible, Prabhupāda replied, that means you are following the instructions of Lord Jesus Christ, so where is the opportunity of being without a spiritual master?\n“I was referring to a living spiritual master.”\nPrabhupāda: “You may accept this spiritual master or that spiritual master. That is a different thing. But you have to accept. When you read the Bible, that means you are following the spiritual master represented by some priest or clergyman in the line of Lord Jesus Christ. So, in any case, you have to follow a spiritual master. There is no question of being without a spiritual master. Is that clear?”\n“Many different sects of Christianity interpret the Bible in different ways.”\nPrabhupāda: “There cannot be any interpretation in the Bible; then there is no authority. Just like this is a watch. Everyone has called it a watch, and if I call it a spectacle, then what is the value of my being spiritual master? I’m misleading. It is a watch, and that I must say. This intelligence you must have – who is a pseudo spiritual master and a real spiritual master. Otherwise, you’ll be cheated, and that is being done. Everyone is interpreting in his own way.\n“There are thousands of editions of theBhagavad-gītā,and they have tried to interpret it in their own way – all nonsense. They should all be thrown away. Simply you have to read theBhagavad-gītāas it is, then you’ll understand. If anyone can understand the clear passage, just like the Bible, ‘God said, “Let there be creation,” and there was creation.’ What is the question of interpretation? Yes, God created. You cannot create. Where is opportunity of interpretation?\n“Am I right, in the beginning of the Bible it is said like that: ‘God said, “Let there be creation,” and there was creation.’ So what is your interpretation? Tell me what is your interpretation. Can any one of you suggest? One canexplain;that is a different thing. But the fact that God created, that will remain; that we cannot change.\n“Nowhowthe creative process took place, that is explained in theBhāgavatam.First of all there was sky, then there was sound, then there was this, that. But the primary fact that God created, that will remain in any circumstance. Not the rascal scientist who says, ‘Oh, there was a chunk, and it split up, and there was this planet. Perhaps this and likely this,’ all this nonsense. Why ‘perhaps’? Here is clear statement: God created. That’s all. Finished.”\nAnother guest said he didn’t feel subordinate to anyone, therefore he didn’t feel he had to bow down to anyone. Indirectly, he was criticizing the devotees’ offering of obeisances to Prabhupāda. It is a material disease, Prabhupāda replied, to think that we don’t have to bow down. He demonstrated logically that nature forces each of us to be subordinate, “to bow down” to old age, disease, death, and many other things.\nGuest: “O.K. But who or whatshouldI bow down to?”\nPrabhupāda: “Since you are being forced to bow down, now you have to find where you shall be happy even by bowing down. And that is Kṛṣṇa. Your bowing down will not be stopped, because you are meant for that; but if you bow down to Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s representative, then you become happy.”\nThe disciples were submissive, and therefore only to them could the spiritual master impart knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But some of them were also doubtful, and Prabhupāda had to convince them with the same logical arguments he used with the outsiders.\nDevotee: “Prabhupāda? How do you logically explain to impersonalists the existence of the Personality of Godhead?”\nPrabhupāda began to explain the three features of the Absolute and compared them to the three features of the sun, namely the sunshine, the sun disk, and the sun-god. Using the well-known example, he thoroughly explained the existence of the Supreme Person as the source of all expansions, including the impersonal Brahman.\n“But [the devotee was not yet satisfied] how does one explain to such an impersonalist the Absolute Truthlogically.I was told Śrīla Bhaktivinoda had such a proof.”\nPrabhupāda: “Apart from Bhaktivinoda, try to understand in your common sense.” Painstakingly, Prabhupāda explained again, this time at greater length. He quoted theVedānta-sūtraversejanmādy asya yataḥ,explaining how everything in existence comes from the Supreme Absolute. Therefore, as we are persons, there must be a Supreme Person, the reservoir of all personality, from whom everything comes. As we experience that our father is a person, therefore we are persons.\nOften Prabhupāda was simply saying there is God and one should love God. But one student protested why love of God should come in the form of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nStudent: “If our first concern should be to serve God, or Kṛṣṇa, then why should there be a movement? You might get so caught up in the movement that you’re forgetting about serving God.”\nPrabhupāda: “Whyam I serving God? This movement means I am serving God. What do you mean by ‘serving’? If Kṛṣṇa says, ‘You obey Me,’ and if I say, ‘You obey Kṛṣṇa,’ is this not service?”\nStudent: “Yes.”\nPrabhupāda: “So we are doing the same business. Kṛṣṇa says, ‘Surrender to Me and give up all other engagement, and I shall give you protection.’ And we are saying the same thing, that you surrender to Kṛṣṇa and you’ll be happy. So we are voluntarily giving service to Kṛṣṇa. Preaching work is the best service, if you preach rightly. If you preach wrongly, that is disservice. You have to simply say the same thing as Kṛṣṇa.”\nStudent: “But the movement might get in the way of serving Kṛṣṇa.”\nPrabhupāda: “It is service to Kṛṣṇa. Because we have understood what Kṛṣṇa wants, we are preaching the same thing.”\nStudent: “Was there always a kind of movement?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, the movement is always there. Just like in theBhagavad-gītāit is said, ‘My dear Arjuna, whenever people are misguided and there is too much irreligiosity, at that time I appear Myself.’ The material world is such that, if something is set right, still some time it will be distorted. Therefore a movement is required whenever there is deterioration of the real truth. But it is the same movement, not a new movement. The movement means God is there, He is great, and we are all subordinate. Our duty is to abide by the order of God, then we are happy. The movement is simple. The same movement was preached by Lord Kṛṣṇa. The same movement was preached by Lord Jesus Christ. The same movement we are also preaching. Simply accepting the authority or the greatness of the Supreme Lord and engaging oneself, that’s all. There is nothing new. Don’t try to see something new. It is the oldest because God is the oldest, you are also the oldest, and your relationship is also the oldest. Therefore the movement is also the oldest. But the process adopted is suitable for this time. That is also not new, not manufactured. It is recommended for this age. Just like during the winter season, the process is to protect your body from being affected by cold. Similarly in this age, Kali-yuga, it is recommended that God realization is only possible by this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nMany of the youngsters would try to catch Prabhupāda in contradictions. One boy noted Prabhupāda’s statement that it was natural for a child to drink milk and not eat the meat of an animal. The boy argued that if Prabhupāda’s emphasis was on being natural, then is it natural for a child to grow up, shave his head, and serve God, or was that just another form of socialization? Another challenger asked why the International Society for Krishna Consciousness was “incorporated.” Another asked if thesādhusin India who wore long hair and wandered in the woods needed spiritual masters.\nThe questions revealed the guests’ uneasiness. Prabhupāda was demanding a full commitment to the truth. They could understand that if they accepted that he was presenting the truth, then they, too, like the bright-faced disciples sitting beside them in the crowded temple room, should bow down to Prabhupāda and Lord Jagannātha, join “the movement,” shave their heads, and go out chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. At least that was the implication. So those who deeply wanted to avoid the austerity, the surrender, the uprooting of a whole lifetime of illusion, sought out the flaws, the possible contradictions. But kind and lenient though he was, Prabhupāda – never demanding that they shave their heads or live in the temple – continued to defeat their doubting arguments, expose the weakness of their atheistic reasoning, and smash the folly of their material desires. He ruled forth as Kṛṣṇa’s representative, speaking from the blue and gold velvetvyāsāsanain the front room of the Seattle house.\nWoman: “I wish to see proofs of afterlife, in writing, so that I can read it and study it and examine it carefully. Is it available in writing?”\nPrabhupāda: “ReadBhagavad-gītā.You’ll understand everything.”\nWoman: “That’s sixty-eight volumes?”\nPrabhupāda: “No,Bhagavad-gītāis one volume only. Eighteen chapters, seven hundred verses. You can read it in three days. It is not very difficult. We have publishedBhagavad-gītāAsIt Is,and I think if you read it, you will get so many nice informations. After readingBhagavad-gītā,you readŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Then you get further enlightenment. Then you readTeachings of Lord Caitanya,and you get further enlightenment. And for general information, we have thisBack to Godheadyou can read. It is not that simply we are talking. We are backed by sufficient knowledge and literature.”\nAnd so it went into the evening, nine o’clock turned to ten o’clock and ten o’clock to ten-thirty.\nIsbhakti-yogafor everyone? What aboutkuṇḍalinī-yoga?Why did Kṛṣṇa ask Arjuna to fight? What about Christ consciousness? What about the Trinity? Prabhupāda was completely absorbed in defeating arguments and answering questions about Kṛṣṇa – asamādhiof debate on behalf of his Lord Kṛṣṇa. Yes, he did expect them, if they were gentlemen, to accept his presentation as correct and to make a real commitment to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. “So here is the offering,” Prabhupāda said. “Take Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now it is your choice. If you can take it, it is good. If you don’t take it, that is your misfortune. Is there any difficulty to accept our formula? I ask all of you, is there any difficulty? I am asking this. You have asked so many questions of me. Is there any difficulty to accept this formula?”\nThe assembled guests and devotees murmured in reply, “No.”\n“So why don’t you take it?” Prabhupāda laughed. “It is so simple, nice. Try to understand by your knowledge. We are not pushing forcibly. You have got your intelligence, argument, logic, everything. But you’ll find it sublime. The author ofCaitanya-caritāmṛtasays that we are placing it for your judgment, not that we are pushing it by force. Sometimes it is said that the Mohammedans propagated their religion by holding a sword in one hand and the Koran in another hand: Either you accept Koran, or there is sword for you. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not like that. It is placed for your judgment. And if you like, you can accept. Otherwise, I came here empty-handed, I shall go back empty-handed. There is no loss, no gain.”\nPrabhupāda laughed with the satisfaction of the completely surrendered servant. Then he asked them all to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa:At that point, I could recognize that Prabhupāda was my complete lord and master. Whenever he would get up from thevyāsāsanaI would just grip his feet and hold them and hold them. I would hold his feet at my head, and I wouldn’t let him walk at all. I was so eager to be at Prabhupāda’s lotus feet. I wanted to be with him as much as I could. I would feel very torn apart when he would go to another temple. I remember sometimes after the program, he would finish eating a piece of fruit and would throw the peel on the floor. We would all jump for it and fight with each other in front of the altar and Prabhupāda. We would be scrapping around like little puppies. Prabhupāda would lean back and laugh. He thought we were making very nice advancement by this.\nAfter the TV showing, there was a brief fame. When Prabhupāda came to the lecture the next night, the temple room was filled with about fifty extra guests, young men and women. Prabhupāda seemed pleased, but actually they were all one group, a fun-seeking fraternity house with their dates. They managed to stay through thekīrtana,but as soon as Prabhupāda began to speak, they all got up and left, leaving the devotees and the usual number of about a dozen interested guests.\nThe devotees were also going to the university, and among the students was considerable interest, at least casually. A representative of a student newspaper came and talked at length with Prabhupāda.\nWhen two men came to Prabhupāda’s apartment and presented themselves as reporters, Prabhupāda’s secretary allowed them in, thinking they also wanted an interview. But their interview became an interrogation. They challenged Prabhupāda as to why he was not teaching that Jesus Christ was the only way to God. They were angry that Prabhupāda was preaching on the campuses. When Prabhupāda informed them that he accepted Jesus Christ as the son of God, they demanded, “But do you believe or not that Jesus is the only way?”\nPrabhupāda replied, “Do you believe that God is limited or unlimited?”\n“Unlimited,” they admitted.\n“Then why are you limiting Him,” said Prabhupāda, “by saying that there is only one way to get to Him? Even an ordinary man can have twenty sons. Do you mean to say that God can have only one son? Why are you limiting Him?”\nWithin a few minutes, the men were speaking to Prabhupāda in loud voices. It became obvious they were not reporters, and they told him they were, in fact, local ministers. When they became blasphemous, the devotees asked them to leave the house. Prabhupāda wrote in a letter to a disciple in New York,\nBefore Prabhupāda’s arrival in Seattle, Upendra had written the head of the Asian department at the University of Washington, requesting a speaking engagement. The professor wrote back entirely in Sanskrit, knowing well that the boys would not be able to read his letter. Upendra gave the letter to Prabhupāda, who immediately translated it and answered the professor with a letter written in English, but quoting many Sanskrit verses. Prabhupāda concluded his letter, “I am sorry that we cannot reply in Sanskrit. Our process is not academic, but purely spiritual.” Prabhupāda had Upendra sign the letter as if he had written it himself.\nPrabhupāda went out himself to speak in several colleges. At the University of Washington, he had Tamāla Kṛṣṇa give an introductory talk. Speaking directly what he had heard from Prabhupāda, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa spoke boldly about “so-called holy men or swamis who are cheating the public.” He took considerable care to demonstrate that “our spiritual master” is in complete agreement with Lord Jesus and the Bible. The Bible is bona fide, he said, but like a pocket dictionary compared to the unabridged.\n“There is a need to hear a person like our spiritual master, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, speak,” said Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. He then read an article from theNew York Daily News,headlined “Retreat for Priests Who Drink,” featuring a sanatorium that had been opened for some of the five thousand alcoholic priests in the United States. “I’m not saying that all priests are like this,” he said. “That’s not at all what I’m trying to get at. But the article goes on to say that alcoholism is not treated as a moral failure, but as a disease. But that’s absurd. Itisa moral failure. These priests have the choice to drink or not to drink. They chose to drink and get drunk. These are men who are leading us back to God.\n“The point is, you must have someone who is pure. To teach about God requires a moral qualification. Our spiritual master spends a hundred percent of his time in praise of the Supreme Lord. We ask you today, please listen closely and just try to understand his teachings. Just listen and test with your reasoning ability and your intellect to see whether this is not the bona fide way to the Absolute Truth. Now let His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda speak.”\nPrabhupāda listened from the orange cloth-covered dais where he sat in the auditorium. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had stood and spoken, and now he joined the other saffron-robed men and the women insārīswho sat at Prabhupāda’s feet. His voice echoing with amplification in the large hall, Prabhupāda spoke to an audience of over a hundred. He quoted the verseoṁ ajñāna-timirāndhasya,explaining that everyone in the material world is in darkness, and the spiritual master is he who opens our eyes with the torch of knowledge. If human society does not have the urge to come to the light by searching after God, then mankind is no better than the animals.\nTo illustrate the point that human society is in a precarious condition for lack of God consciousness, Prabhupāda told “a very nice story.”\n“One rat,” he said, “was troubled with a cat, so he came to a saintly person.\n“ ‘My dear sir, I am very much troubled.’\n“ ‘What is the difficulty?’\n“The rat said, ‘The cat always chases, so I am not in peace of mind.’\n“ ‘Then what do you want?’\n“ ‘Please make me a cat.’\n“ ‘All right, you become a cat.’ But after a few days, the cat returned to the saintly person and complained that he was being chased by the dogs. The saintly person gave him the benediction, ‘All right, become a dog.’ Then the foxes chased the dog. The saintly person blessed him again, ‘All right, become a fox.’ Then the tigers chased him. The saintly person turned him into a tiger.\n“And when he became a tiger,” Prabhupāda continued, “he began to stare his eyes on the saintly person, ‘I shall eat you.’\n“ ‘Oh! You shall eat me? I have made you tiger, and you want to eat me?’\n“ ‘Yes, I am a tiger and I shall eat you.’\n“ ‘Oh,’ then the saintly person cursed him, ‘again you become a rat. Again you become a rat.’ So he became a rat.\n“So our human civilization is going to be like that. The other day I was reading in your world almanac. In the next hundred years, people will live underground like rats. So our scientific advancement has created this atomic bomb to kill man, and it will be used. And we have to go underground to become again rat. From tiger again rat. That is going to be. That is nature’s law:daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mamamāyā duratyayā.If you defy the laws of your state, then you are put into difficulty. Similarly, if you continue to defy the authority, the supremacy of the Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead, then the same result – again you become rat. As soon as there is atomic bomb, everything, all civilization on the surface of the globe, will be finished. So people may not like it. It may be very unpalatable, but the fact is like that.”\nPrabhupāda explained that the God consciousness he was advocating was not a particular rigid religion like Christian or Hindu or Muslim, but it was universal. He explained the worddharmaas one’s characteristic, that which cannot be taken away. The unalterable characteristic of the living entity, he said, is the tendency to love and do service, and that is our eternal religion.\n“So I do not wish to take much of your time,” Prabhupāda concluded after no more than ten minutes, “but simply I want to impress upon you that this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is so nice that if you give an experimental way, you can see. You chant for at least one week, and you see how much you have changed. So these boys, they are chanting in the street. We have got many branches in your country, one in London, one in Germany, and everyone is taking part. It is increasing. So we don’t charge anything, neither you have got any loss. If there is any profit, you can try it, but there is not loss. That is guaranteed. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Thank you very much.”\n“Excuse me,” she began, “I have to speak to you.”\n“Please wait,” said Prabhupāda.\n“Why are you sitting on a raised seat?” she exclaimed. “You are sitting up there, and all these people are sitting here, and you’re like you’re on a throne.” Devotees tried politely to check her, but she wanted to be heard. Prabhupāda was silent.\n“Why does everyone bow to you?” she demanded. “Don’t you know God is everywhere? Everyone is God.”\n“That’s all right,” said Prabhupāda. “Let us chant.” Her argument was drowned out by a rousingkīrtanacelebrating the completion of the initiation ceremony. When thekīrtanaended, Prabhupāda was still thinking of the disruptive guest.\nPrabhupāda: “Where is that girl? She is gone?”\nViṣṇujana: “I think Madhudviṣa explained to her. She didn’t know about the bowing down and everything.”\nPrabhupāda: “What was her question?”\nViṣṇujana: “She was thinking that we were bowing to you as if you were God. She resents this because in the Christian religion it says, ‘Bow down to no man.’ ”\n“What did you explain?” Prabhupāda laughed. “Did you not explain that we are bowing down not as God but as God’s representative? Could you not explain like this?”\n“She’s over there, I think,” said Madhudviṣa, “if you’d like to talk to her.” But theyoginīhad left the room and was now out front talking with the new girl, Joy, who had been living with Prabhupāda’s disciples since his first night in Seattle. Theyoginīwas trying to revive Joy’s old interest in impersonalyogaand was criticizing Prabhupāda. Although Joy had cried when Prabhupāda was blasphemed, she became confused hearing theyoginīspeak impersonal, antidevotional philosophy.\nThen as Prabhupāda was leaving the temple to get into his car, theyoginīobstructed his path and continued her blasphemy.\n“No one should bow down,” she railed, “because everyone is God.”\nPrabhupāda became angry, a fiery look in his wide eyes. Suddenly Joy Fulcher came forward and threw herself on the ground before Prabhupāda, placing her hand on his foot. She had been confused about whom to accept, but now felt compelled to surrender to Prabhupāda. He allowed her to keep her hand on his foot while theyoginīgradually subsided before Prabhupāda’s angry silence and let him pass. Getting into the van, Prabhupāda bumped his head on the inside of the roof. The devotees were furious and blamed the blasphemous girl for what happened. As the van drove away, Prabhupāda turned to Nara-Nārāyaṇa, who was driving. “That girl said everyone is God. But she objected that they were bowing down to me. But if everyone is God, am I not also God?”\nJāhnavā dāsī (Joy Fulcher):Prabhupāda asked, “What kind of girl is it who sees every man as God?” He was referring to the troublesome girl who had blasphemed at the initiation. I didn’t understand him, so he repeated the question, then a third time, and added, “She’s a prostitute, isn’t she?!” Fortunately, Govinda dāsī walked in at that moment and was able to tell me later what his question had been. At the time, all I knew was that I accepted His Divine Grace as spiritual master and that the answer to his question (no matter what it was) was “Yes.” So I answered, “Yes, ŚrīlaPrabhupāda.” And he was pleased. Then he warned, “Don’t associate with nondevotees.”\nI wanted him to know that I accepted him without doubt as my spiritual master. Very sentimentally, I said, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, I have always had trouble with my material father and mother, but now I can understand thatyouare my real father.” His Divine Grace mercifully matched my tone and gently said, “Everyone has a material father and mother, but you have a spiritual father. You are very fortunate.”\nI was crazy and had trouble seeing him because he appeared very effulgent, so I was wiping my eyes with my hands. Also I couldn’t understand his accent, so I kept wiping my ears with my hands. His Divine Grace took compassion on my struggle to be Kṛṣṇa conscious. He then penetrated my impersonalism with a beautiful description of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s form. As I sat facing him, he was looking past me, over my shoulder. His Divine Grace said, “Just see how beautifully Lord Kṛṣṇa’s hair is resting on His shoulders. Just see how His eyes are beautiful, like two lotus petals. Just see how nicely Lord Kṛṣṇa has wrapped His shawl about His thighs. Just see how nicely He has put on Hisdhotī.” He also mentioned the Lord’s lotus feet. I don’t know whether he was looking at a Deity or a picture of Kṛṣṇa or whether Lord Kṛṣṇa was standing there, as he looked up and down, describing His form. All I knew was that if I turned around I would see a painting or brass or air. So I decided just to look at His Divine Grace and hear him describe Lord Kṛṣṇa as he saw Him.\nAfter I left the room, Govinda dāsī asked what His Divine Grace had said about painting. She couldn’t believe it when I told her we didn’t discuss painting for the whole hour. (Knowing that the spiritual master knows everything, I had waited for him to bring up the subject and give me that service.) She brought me back and explained to him the purpose for which I had come. He asked my artistic background and was unimpressed when I rattled it off, because I was proud. Then he ordered me to paint the Pañca-tattva.\nNot only new recruits but older devotees were being drawn closer to Prabhupāda by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. In the Sanskrit scriptures, the wordupanītimeans “coming closer to the spiritual master for the purpose of receiving more confidential instructions in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” Prabhupāda also took the opportunity of any meeting with his disciples to try to bring them closer to the Lord.\nNara-Nārāyaṇa:One of the most deeply impressive things that happened to me was the very first time I sat alone with Śrīla Prabhupāda. I had been with Śrīla Prabhupāda in San Francisco before in his room, but there were other people there, and I was a newcomer. But then I sat alone with Śrīla Prabhupāda, and I was terribly fearful because I didn’t know what to do, what to say. I was a little spaced out from all my karmic activities and was totally tense, like I was going to explode like a jack-in-the-box, because I didn’t know what to do. I watched Śrīla Prabhupāda opening letters. He opened the envelope all the way out and saved it and used it later to write on in order to save paper. He showed me some letter from somewhere and asked my opinion. Then he asked me to get something from his cabinet, and I did.\nHis room was surrounded by windows, with light shining in from a very nice angle because of the way it was a little subterranean. The table was very low, just like a coffee table, and he was sitting behind it. I happened to be in the back against the wall, and he asked me to get something from one of his cabinets which was also behind there. So he and I both ended up behind his low table. He was standing and I was crouching. When I stood up, Śrīla Prabhupāda, out of the blue, began to talk to me. I was just so flabbergasted. Anytime he spoke to me, I became so disconcerted that I could hardly hear what he was saying. He pointed to the table.\nHe said, “You see this little ant?” I looked at the table and no ant was there. Prabhupāda was pointing his finger. He said, “Do you see that little ant?” I said, “Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.” He said, “We should think that our goal should be how to make this ant Kṛṣṇa conscious.” I was just sort of blown away by what he said. He said, “We should go to this ant and we should lean down,” and Prabhupāda leaned down to the invisible ant on the table where he propped his forefinger and thumb together, poking toward the ant. “You should chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.” And he said, “We should give a littleprasādam.If we do that,” he said, “our whole movement will be a success.” I was completely impressed by the statement because I understood even though Śrīla Prabhupāda always had big schemes for a big world ISKCON, yet his heart was always lined with these small items, and this was so wonderful. If one person hears Hare Kṛṣṇa, then it is worth the whole effort.\nLove for Śrīla Prabhupāda was also brought out by the prospect of separation from him. Govinda dāsī and her husband had been Prabhupāda’s secretaries for a year. They had been with him wherever he went – from the West Coast, to Boston, to Montreal, to Santa Fe. They were always with him, like a part of his intimate family, and they had become very attached to being with him. But in his desire to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Prabhupāda sent Govinda dāsī’s husband, Gaurasundara, to Hawaii before coming to Seattle, to open an ISKCON center there. In Seattle Prabhupāda asked Govinda dāsī to join her husband.\nGovinda dāsī: IfPrabhupāda said, “Very nice,” your life was perfect – whether he said it for your cookingcapātīsor peanuts, or doing a drawing, or akīrtana,or anything. If he said, “Very nice,” and smiled and nodded his head, then your life’s ambition was achieved, for that moment anyway. Getting him to smile, seeing him happy, was the goal of life, and you didn’t really remember things like liberation. It was almost as if the idea of going to a heavenly planet or even Kṛṣṇaloka became distant.\nBut at this time I knew that I was going to have to leave Śrīla Prabhupāda soon. I was so very, very attached to him that I would wake up in the middle of the night crying. Almost every night I would invariably be crying in my dreams or in my sleep because of having to leave him soon, and I didn’t want to. It was a very painful time.\nAfterwards, Prabhupāda said, “I have just received one telegram from India. The person who gave mesannyāsahas left his body.” Prabhupāda continued to explain.\n“One has to accept the renounced order of life from another person who is in the renounced order,” he said. “I never thought that I shall accept the renounced order of life. In my family life, when I was in the midst of my wife and children, sometimes I was dreaming that my spiritual master was calling me and I was following him. When my dream was over, I was thinking I was a little horrified. ‘Oh, Guru Mahārāja wants me to becomesannyāsī.How can I acceptsannyāsa?’ At that time I was feeling not very much satisfaction that I have to give up my family and become a mendicant. At that time it was a horrible thing. Sometimes I was thinking, ‘No, I cannot takesannyāsa.’ But again I saw the same dream. So in this way, I was fortunate. My Guru Mahārāja” – here Prabhupāda’s voice choked, and he became overwhelmed with emotion, “he pulled me out from this material life.” For moments Prabhupāda could not speak. Everyone present saw tears pour from his eyes, and then he spoke further. Although the occasion was the passing away of the person who awarded himsannyāsa,Prabhupāda was now speaking more of how his own spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, had called him and saved him and made him takesannyāsathrough hissannyāsa-guru.\n“I have not lost anything,” Prabhupāda said. “He was so kind upon me. I have gained. I left three children; I have now got three hundred children, so I am not loser. This is material conception. We think that we shall be loser by accepting Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is loser. I say from my practical experience. I was thinking that, How can I accept this renounced order of life? I cannot accept so much trouble. But I retired from my family life. I was sitting alone in Vṛndāvana, writing books. So this, my Godbrother, he insisted me, ‘Bhaktivedanta Prabhu.’ This title was given in my family life. It was offered to me by the Vaiṣṇava society. So he insisted. Not he insisted – practically my spiritual master insisted me through him, that you accept. Because without accepting the renounced order of life, nobody can become a preacher. So he wanted me to become a preacher. So he forced me through this Godbrother – ‘You accept.’ So unwillingly I accepted. And then I remembered that he wanted me to go to the Western country.\n“So I am feeling now very obliged to my, this Godbrother, that he carried out the wish of my spiritual master and forced me to accept thissannyāsaorder. So this Godbrother, His Holiness Keśava Mahārāja, is no more. He has entered Kṛṣṇa’s abode. So I wish to pass a resolution of bereavement and send that. And I have composed one verse also in this connection in Sanskrit. So you all present, you sign this. I shall send it tomorrow.\n“The verse I have composed, it is in Sanskrit.Vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga.This Kṛṣṇa consciousness isvairāgya-vidyā. Vairāgya-vidyāmeans to become detestful to this material world. That is calledvairāgya-vidyā.And that is possible simply by thisbhakti-yoga.Vairāgya-vidyā nija-bhakti-yogam apāyayāṁ mām. This is just like medicine. The child is afraid of taking medicine. That also I have experience. In my childhood, when I became ill I was very stubborn: ‘I won’t accept any medicine.’ So my mother used to force medicine within my mouth with a spoon, I was so obstinate. So anyway, similarly I did not want to accept thesannyāsaorder, but this Godbrother forced me, ‘You must.’Apāyayām– he forcefully made me to drink this medicine.Anaviṣyum andham.Why I was unwilling?Anaviṣyummeans unwilling.Andhammeans one who is blind, who cannot see his future. This spiritual life is the brightest future, but the materialist cannot see to it. But the Vaiṣṇavas, the spiritual master, they forcefully, ‘You drink this medicine.’ You see –apāyayāṁ mām anaviṣyum andhaṁ śrī-keśava-bhakti-prajñānam.\n“So this my Godbrother, his name is Keśava, Bhaktiprajña Keśava.Kṛpāmbudhi.So he did this favor upon me because he was an ocean of mercy. So we offer our obeisances to Vaiṣṇavakṛpāmbudhi. Vāñchā-kalpatarubhyaś ca kṛpā-sindhubhya eva ca.The Vaiṣṇavas, the representatives of the Lord, they are so kind. They bring the ocean of mercy for distributing to the suffering humanity.Kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye.\n“So I am offering my respectful obeisances unto this, His Holiness, because he forcibly made me adopt thesannyāsaorder. So he is no more in this world, he has entered Kṛṣṇa’s abode. So I am offering my respectful obeisances along with my disciples. On the first day of mysannyāsaI never thought … But I remembered that I’ll have to speak in English. I remember on thatsannyāsaday when there was a reception. So I first of all spoke in English. So it is all arrangement of Kṛṣṇa, higher authority.\n“We are writing like this: ‘Resolved that we the undersigned members and devotees of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness Incorporated, in a meeting under the Presidency of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, today the 2lst of October, 1968, at our Seattle branch, express our profound bereavement on hearing the passing away of His Divine Grace Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktiprajñāna Keśava Goswami Mahārāja, thesannyāsaguru,preceptor, of our spiritual master. And on October 6th, 1968, at his headquarter residence in Navadvīpa, West Bengal. We offer our respectful obeisances at the lotus feet of Śrī Śrīmad B. P. Keśava Goswami Mahārāja with the following verse composed on this occasion by our spiritual master.’ This verse I have already explained to you. So I wish that you all sign this, and I’ll send it tomorrow by airmail. You have got pencil?”\nPrabhupāda first signed his own name and then gave the letter to Kartikeya to take to each devotee in the room. One by one, they placed the paper on the floor and signed it. The devotee carrying the paper was about to pass by several guests, but Prabhupāda said, “No, no. Everyone here is present, and so they are all a witness.” The last one to sign was Prabhupāda’s servant, Kartikeya. Kartikeya put the paper on the floor and slowly signed his name, while Śrīla Prabhupāda leaned forward on thevyāsāsana,watching very intently.\nGovinda dāsī made Prabhupāda his favorite food,kacaurīs,to take on the plane. Prabhupāda had taught her how to cook them. One of the secrets was to put thekacaurīsinto hot ghee once so that they puffed up, but then cool them and recook them in the ghee. “Cook them twice,” he said, “until it becomes reddish.” As she cooked them, and while they were still hot, Prabhupāda wanted to try one. When he began asking for one after another, Govinda dāsī said, “Prabhupāda, you are going to eat them all, and you won’t have any for your journey.”\n“Never mind,” he replied. “Bring me more. Never mind my journey.” According to Govinda dāsī, he ate eightkacaurīs,and she made more for his journey.\nJāhnavā dāsī:The next day His Divine Grace was leaving for Montreal, so I was told to make the garland for him. I took too long and made it on thin thread. We were already late, but I made us even later in picking up His Divine Grace to take him to the airport. When we arrived at his apartment about one half-hour from the temple, Harṣarāṇī ran out of the apartment and told us that she had never seen him so furious. She warned us that we were “really going to get it” for being late. Then Govinda dāsī came out and confirmed what Harṣarāṇī said. Then Kartikeya came out, visibly shaken, followed by His Divine Grace. Instead of garlanding him, Upendra bowed down and with shaking hands held the garland above his bowed head. His Divine Grace simply put on the garland and, without a word of remonstration, got into the van.\nNara-Nārāyaṇa:Bilvamaṅgalā didn’t know how to drive; he was swaying this way and that way. And as we were going toward the downtown area, Prabhupāda said, “Who knows how to get to the airport?” We all looked at each other. Not one of us had ever been to the Seattle airport, and it was late for his plane. I said, “I think it is this way.” Prabhupāda looked at me as sharply as a razor blade and said, “Think? ‘Think’ means you do not know.” Finally there was an entrance onto the freeway, and I stopped there. Prabhupāda said, “I want to take a taxi. You do not know.” He said heavier things than that, which my mind has blocked out. I stopped and said, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, let’s wait a moment. Surely we will find a way.” I quickly called out the window to a hitchhiker on the side of the freeway, “Where is the airport?” And he told us how to get there. Prabhupāda was angry, because he not only liked to be at the airport on time, but ahead of time by at least an hour. So we got on the freeway, and this boy obviously did not know how to drive. The car was swaying and rocking back and forth like a boat in a heavy storm, and Prabhupāda was looking disturbed. I was sitting in the back, and to make matters worse, every time the car swayed like that, the girls put their hands together and started chantingtava kara-kamala-vare.We drove on, and by the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa, we got to the airport a half hour ahead of the flight.\nJāhnavā dāsī:When we got into the airport, His Divine Grace stepped through the front doors, and immediately his knee-length garland on the thin thread broke, but he simply cradled the two fallen ends in his arms and walked on with great dignity, his head held high and tilted back. Then the devotees gave me petals to throw at his feet. I thought that we would disturb the airlines by leaving petals everywhere. I threw the petals clumsily because I was distracted by my doubt, until His Divine Grace said, “That’s all right, no more petals.” Then when we sat waiting for his flight, I was pretty morose at his feet. He looked down and spoke that familiar blessing, “Is everything all right?” Then the devotees gave me a particularly exquisite and fragrant red rose to give to him. As he boarded the plane, he kept the rose and gave his garland to Upendra to distribute. Although I had only been a devotee for a month, still I, too, was faced with that unbearable separation from reciprocating with him in his physical form. His Divine Grace sat by the window, and he waved the long-stemmed rose slowly, and then he ducked out of view while we were dancing and having ecstatickīrtana.Then he came back to the window and waved the rose and then ducked out of sight again. He did this several times, and we responded each time with more forceful chanting and dancing. Then he left.\nOctober 27, 1968Prabhupāda was traveling alone when he arrived in Chicago on a morning flight from Montreal. Inside the busy terminal building of O’Hare Airport, people rushed down the corridors or looked anxiously at the airport television screens overhead to find the right gate. Prabhupāda was to immediately catch a connecting flight to Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nPrabhupāda checked the overhead television screens for his flight’s gate number and made his way down the crowded corridor. The rush and congestion made stopping even for a moment hazardous. As Prabhupāda headed down the long corridor, passersby eyed him curiously. He came to a flight of stairs and started quickly down them, moving with the crowd. Suddenly he tripped and lost his balance. He dropped his bag and fell down several stairs. He didn’t get up. His hand was cut, and he felt pain in several places. Then a gentleman came, helped him stand, and handed him his bag. The stream of passengers continued to rush past while the gentleman waited, asking Prabhupāda if he was all right. Prabhupāda thanked the man and said that he would be able to proceed by himself.\nOn the plane for Santa Fe, Prabhupāda looked at his hand. The cut had bled a little but had now stopped, and he saw a bruise appearing.\nWhen Prabhupāda arrived at the Montreal airport, a reporter had asked him, “Swami, in the course of your travels, what difficulties do you encounter?” And Prabhupāda had replied, “I have no difficulties. You have difficulties.”\nAnd it was a fact. Prabhupāda was simply depending on Kṛṣṇa, and so he had no problems. That had also been Prahlāda Mahārāja’s prayer: “O best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material existence, for wherever I stay I am fully absorbed in thoughts of Your glories and activities. My concern is only for the fools and rascals who are making elaborate plans for material happiness and maintaining their families, societies and countries. I am simply concerned with love for them.”\nThe reporter, however, had only written something foolish: “Hush-Puppied High Priest.” A television news team, with cameras and lights, had come to the Seattle temple to interview Prabhupāda, and that night part of the interview had been televised. It had been favorable coverage. A Christian minister, however, a Mr. Miller from the University of Washington, had written in protest of Prabhupāda’s preaching at the University. But Prabhupāda had replied that the Church had failed to satisfy so many boys and girls. So if some of them were following him and giving up sinful life, why should the Christians protest? They should be glad.\nAt the Albuquerque airport, Harināma, president of the Santa Fe temple, and Govinda dāsī met Prabhupāda. But they greeted him with strange news. “Prabhupāda,” Govinda dāsī said, “the temple here has no money. You can’t stay. You will have to go on to Los Angeles.”\nPrabhupāda turned to Harināma. “Why did you ask me to come here?” Harināma glanced at Govinda dāsī and then shifted his foot, which seemed to be causing him pain. He apologized and explained that the night before, he had been bitten by a black widow spider. But Prabhupāda’s question was unanswered.\n“So what are you going to do?” Prabhupāda demanded. “I can’t go to Los Angeles tonight.” He looked from Harināma to Govinda dāsī. “I must stay here in Albuquerque at least for the night in a hotel.”\nGovinda dāsī assigned herself to calling motels to find a suitable, reasonably priced room. While she was gone, Harināma found Prabhupāda a seat. “Govinda dāsī said you are not feeling well,” Harināma said.\n“Don’t worry about my health,” Prabhupāda said. “I am not a sick man. Govinda dāsī is sick. I am not sick. So what are you going to do?” Govinda dāsī returned and said she couldn’t find any reasonable motels. Then she began to cry.\n“You know Kṛṣṇa, Prabhupāda,” she pleaded. “What does Kṛṣṇa want us to do?”\n“That is not the point,” Prabhupāda said angrily. “Kṛṣṇa wants to know what you want to do!”\nHarināma, disgusted with Govinda dāsī’s attitude, suddenly became decisive. “I think we should go to Santa Fe,” he said. Prabhupāda agreed; it seemed the only thing to do. Getting into the temple Volkswagen at four in the afternoon, they started the sixty-mile drive from Albuquerque to Santa Fe. The clouds overhead formed unusual symmetrical patterns on either side of the road. “I have never seen the clouds so beautiful as today,” Harināma said.\nAn hour and a half later, as they pulled into the driveway of the little storefront building, Prabhupāda noticed a handmade sign: “SWAMIJI IS COMING.” “Yes,” he said. And he smiled – his first expression of pleasure since arriving in New Mexico. “Youwereexpecting me.”\nComing in through the back door, Prabhupāda, escorted by Harināma, entered a newly painted room. A rug partially covered the linoleum floor, a wooden table was an altar, and a madras-covered crate with a pillow was Prabhupāda’s seat. Prabhupāda, however, chose to sit on the rug instead of the crate, and the devotees and guests sat around him.\n“This is a nice room,” Prabhupāda said, looking around. “I will stay here.”\nGovinda dāsī brought Prabhupāda a plate of cut fruit, and Prabhupāda opened a lunch bag containinglaḍḍuandkacaurīs.About eight guests (hippies) were present, and Prabhupāda distributedprasādamto everyone. One of the guests, never having tastedlaḍḍubefore, remarked, “This is the best peanut butter I’ve ever eaten.”\n“This is the preparation,” Prabhupāda explained, “that the mothers make for Kṛṣṇa and the friends of Kṛṣṇa to take with them in their lunch bags. They put this in their lunch bags when they go and play.” One of the guests asked Prabhupāda, “Who is Kṛṣṇa?”\n“Kṛṣṇa,” Prabhupāda replied, “is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is playing with the cowherd boys.”\nPrabhupāda asked to spend the night in the Santa Fe storefront, but the devotees told him that, as the heater was too loud, he would be more comfortable staying in an apartment nearby. He complied. Harināma assigned a recently initiated boy, Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa, to be Prabhupāda’s servant.\nWhen Prabhupāda got to his room and found it dark, Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa had to replace the burned-out bulb in the ceiling socket. When the light came on Prabhupāda looked around the room and found it practically bare. There was a mattress on the floor but no pillow. There was no desk, so Prabhupāda made his own desk by setting his books on his suitcase, a wooden chest a devotee in Seattle had built.\n“So,” Prabhupāda said, “do you know how to type?”\n“No.”\nPrabhupāda was unable to sleep that night because of the glare from the streetlamp, so he sat at his desk writing purports for the verses ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.As he wrote, his pen scratched with a hollow sound across the wooden suitcase. Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa took rest in another room, while Prabhupāda went on writing all night, his pen scratching on the hollow wooden desk. Then, at four in the morning, Prabhupāda rang the little bell Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa had left with him and called, “Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa.”\nToṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa came running. “Yes, Prabhupāda?”\n“It is four o’clock,” Prabhupāda said. “You should get up.” Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa had run to the door without his glasses, so he hurried back to get them. He then ran back again to Prabhupāda’s room and sat down before him.\n“The first thing,” Prabhupāda said, “is you haven’t paid your obeisances.” Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa slapped his hand to his head, and Prabhupāda began to chuckle. As the boy put his head to the floor in honor of his spiritual master, Prabhupāda said, “That’s all right. It is just for practice.”\nThen Prabhupāda spoke sternly. “Why have you brought me to Santa Fe and then told me to leave? Hmmm?” Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa, a devotee for only two months, didn’t know what to say.\nPrabhupāda persisted. “Why is this? Why have you done this?”\n“Well … Govinda dāsī … ”\n“Govinda dāsī! Never listen to a woman!” Prabhupāda smiled as he spoke, but then again he sternly cautioned Toṣaṇa, “Don’t laugh! So what did she say?”\n“Well, she was concerned about your health – because of the altitude. She had talked with some doctors and friends of hers, and she became concerned that the altitude might affect you. As a matter of fact, she was sick herself. As soon as she got here, she became sick. So she convinced Harināma that they should tell you that you shouldn’t stay here.”\n“Govinda dāsī will always be sick. She will be sick in heaven.” Prabhupāda began laughing, but Toṣaṇa only looked back nervously. “So they think Swamiji will come here and die.” Prabhupāda gestured towards the window. “There are so many people living here.”\nToṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa:It became cold in the morning, so he told me to turn on all the burners on the stove. He rubbed his head and started singing the prayers to the spiritual master. He half-sang, half-said them, and when he was done, we both chantedjapatogether. I knew I was very fortunate. Then he had me do little things like turn off the burners on the stove – “Now you can turn one off. Now you can turn another one off.” It was getting warmer. Later we went for an early-morning walk. I had nothing to ask Prabhupāda, since I knew so little of the philosophy. He was telling me that one’s fortunate life begins when he meets a devotee.\nThat night about forty guests came to the temple – a big increase over the usual attendance. The audience was almost entirely young couples, and Prabhupāda talked about Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in a way that seemed most fitting.\n“Rādhārāṇī is the most beautiful girl,” he said, “and Kṛṣṇa is the most beautiful boy.” He explained that Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are the perfection of the conjugal relationship, and when that same conjugal relationship is exhibited by the conditioned souls in the material world, it is only a perverted reflection.\nAfter the lecture, as Prabhupāda spoke casually with the guests, an elderly woman introduced herself as the head of the Albuquerque Yoga Club and invited Prabhupāda to come there to speak.\nPrabhupāda said he would be happy to come and, turning to Harināma, said, “We should go. They have invited me.”\n“But they already have another engagement for you in Los Angeles,” Harināma replied. So Prabhupāda ended his short stay in Santa Fe after only one day."

        "content": "October 28, 1968\nON RETURNING TO Los Angeles from Santa Fe, Prabhupāda found his followers in their new location on Hollywood Boulevard, in the tourist section, a block from Grauman’s Chinese Theater. The new temple, a former beauty parlor, occupied the large first floor of an elegant old six-story office building. The space – actually tri-level, with a ground floor, a mezzanine, and a basement, was filled with more than forty devotees. Prabhupāda stayed in the Lucky Seven Hotel across the street. In the early evening, before the devotees would go out again to chant, they would crowd into Prabhupāda’s room and sit with him.\nPrabhupāda had ordered that in every center his disciples perform publickīrtana,and that order was sending the devotees in New York, Boston, and San Francisco to the parks. In L.A. the devotees were going out twelve hours a day chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa in Hollywood. Prabhupāda had simply asked that they go out and chant, but enthusiastic new leaders Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Viṣṇujana were taking that order to the fullest extent.\nOne night Prabhupāda came out in a car and parked in front of thekīrtanaparty, watching the chanting and dancing with pleasure. Viṣṇujana, who had become especially expert on themṛdaṅga,played and led the chanting. The boys wore clean, uniform saffrondhotīs,and the women saffronsārīs.Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had organized the devotees almost to the point of choreography, and Prabhupāda watched as devotees raised their hands and danced back and forth in the “Swami Step,” which he himself had taught.\nHundreds of tourists walked along Hollywood and Vine, going to the theaters, the wax museum, the seedy bars, and the nightclubs. And although sometimes they laughed or made fun of the chanters, they were more often astonished and, at least for a moment, as they stopped in their tracks, delighted. But to Prabhupāda, sitting quietly in the car, watching the devotees, the chanting was a benediction on the sleeping souls passing by. He was convinced that everyone on Hollywood Boulevard who heard the chanting was being purified of lifetimes of sinful activity – this was the power of the holy name. And the youthful disciples on the street, energetically singing to Viṣṇujana’s beat, were also aware of this. Seeing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s car and knowing that he was watching renewed their enthusiasm.\nTo Prabhupāda, thiskīrtanaparty was only happening by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī’s blessings. Surely he would be pleased to see this revolutionary phenomenon – the holy name resounding from young American Vaiṣṇavas in the late night of this sinful city. And as Prabhupāda was convinced of the blessings of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, so his young followers, knowing their spiritual master was watching them, were similarly convinced by him, and they transcended all fatigue and doubt.\nThe devotees’ residence on Hollywood Boulevard was short lived. Their public chanting had already made them a sensation, and the arrival of the Jagannātha deities was more than the landlord had bargained for. The other tenants of the building were also disturbed, especially whenever the air-conditioning system would pick up the aroma of the chili-spiceddāland circulate the fumes throughout the building, causing office workers to gasp and cough. The landlord served an eviction notice; he would return the devotees’ $450on the condition that they move themselves and all their belongings from the building that same day.\nThe devotees had no choice. They put everything – stove, furniture, rugs, pots and pans, soap, split peas, even Lord Jagannātha – out on the sidewalk. They had nowhere to go. While the women and children waited for hours amid the paraphernalia on the street, some other devotees managed to rent enough warehouse space for the furniture.\nGradually the devotees relocated in various places. An elderly English lady allowed a few devotees to stay at her house. Thebrahmacārīsfound a small house in the Watts area, and a few women went to another place. Dayānanda, who had a job and his own apartment, took a few married couples at his place and found an apartment for Prabhupāda, Lord Jagannātha, and Kartā Mahāśaya on Hayworth Street. Thus the devotees of the Los Angeles temple became scattered.\nDespite the odd circumstances, they still came together every day for chanting, either on Hollywood Boulevard or in some other Los Angeles area. Prabhupāda began visiting thebrahmacārīsat their house, where he held regular Monday, Wednesday, and Friday lectures. He would leadkīrtana,often masterfully playing themṛdaṅga,and his playing would make everyone dance.\nNandarāṇī had arranged for Prabhupāda to lecture at the Hollywood Vegetarian Society. “Do they want to hear aboutBhagavad-gītā?”Prabhupāda asked.\n“No,” Nandarāṇī replied. “They only want to hear about being vegetarian.”\n“You tell them Swamiji doesn’t know anything about being vegetarian. Tell them I don’t know anything. But if they want to learn aboutBhagavad-gītā,I know something.”\nNandarāṇī called the Vegetarian Society and asked if they wanted to hear aboutBhagavad-gītā.They didn’t.\nPrabhupāda said, “And we aren’t interested in lecturing at mundane programs. Even the pigeons are vegetarians. We don’t want to be pigeons. We don’t care for vegetarian or nonvegetarian. We only care if we can offer it to Kṛṣṇa, then we eat it.”\nŚrīmatī dāsī:Tamāla Kṛṣṇa met a woman onsaṅkīrtanawho offered her garage for Śrīla Prabhupāda to lecture in. It was in a nice neighborhood with a clean double garage. We cleaned it even more. We put up madrases on the wall, pictures over that, a large altar on one side, and avyāsāsanafor Śrīla Prabhupāda in the back. It was cold out. We kept the large double doors closed so we could heat the place and filled the air with incense, expecting Śrīla Prabhupāda to arrive soon. Many neighbors and devotees filled the garage. Jaya Gopāla waited out front to give a blast on the conchshell as Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived. We heard the conchshell and opened the garage door. As it raised from the bottom and swung slowly up to the ceiling, Śrīla Prabhupāda stood there, small and dignified, waiting to enter. He walked in majestically, took his seat on hisvyāsāsana,and began akīrtana.His lecture struck the curiosity of many neighborhood guests. They all went home with magazines,prasādam,and a new experience to relate to their friends. Thus Śrīla Prabhupāda’s preaching was going on.\nOne night, while speaking at a garage meeting, Prabhupāda described explicitly Kṛṣṇa’s abode, where houses are made ofcintāmaṇistone and the trees are all desire trees. The inhabitants there as well as the land and trees all have spiritual forms and are full of bliss and knowledge. There everyone serves Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa reciprocates.\nOn another night Prabhupāda spoke about the song “Hari Hari Viphale” by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. In this song, Prabhupāda explained, the author is lamenting his disqualifications and is begging for Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura laments that instead of worshiping Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, he has simply wasted his life in sense gratification. Prabhupāda would often speak about Lord Caitanya’ssaṅkīrtanamovement of chanting the holy names as the antidote for the ills of Kali-yuga.\nThe devotees always had questions. Madhudviṣa asked how abrahmacārīcan channel his sex desire in serving Kṛṣṇa. Viṣṇujana asked whether the spiritual master’s mercy was the source of the bliss he was feeling. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked how Kṛṣṇa could be both the father of everyone and the son of His devotee. And there were questions about what it was like to be a cow or tree in Kṛṣṇaloka and whether the soul’srasa,or serving relationship, with Kṛṣṇa could ever be changed. And Prabhupāda would answer these questions at length.\nBut rarely would Prabhupāda complain that there was no temple; rather he would say, “Never mind that we have no place, we have no temple. Kṛṣṇa has provided this garage, so we accept it.” Although homeless in Los Angeles, the devotees’ basic ingredient for devotional life remained intact. It was not uncommon by Indian standards, Prabhupāda explained, for one’s living situation to be unsettled. In India, he said, as many as twenty people might keep their belongings in a single room; they would come and go, taking whatever they needed from the room, while living outside, sleeping next to the road. But in America, of course, such a life was impossible. And garage meetings would attract few people.\nOn November 28 Prabhupāda wrote in a letter, “So far as it goes in Los Angeles, everything is going very nicely with the sankirtan party, and soon we are expected to have a new temple location.”\nWhen Prabhupāda met the devotees in the evening, he would ask them, “How many magazines did you distribute? How much money did you collect?” By their good results and Prabhupāda’s pleasure, a feeling of high spirits prevailed. But one night, when they came to visit him in his apartment, Prabhupāda’s mood was different. He seemed intolerant. A complacency had set in among the devotees.\n“How long do you expect me to sit in this house?” he demanded of Dayānanda. And then he turned indignantly from one devotee to another. “What are you doing? The deities are in my apartment, and you are all here. What are you doing?” He looked at Nara-Nārāyaṇa. “What haveyoudone today to find a temple?”\n“Well, Prabhupāda, I was …”\nBut without fully hearing Nara-Nārāyaṇa’s reply or excuse, Prabhupāda turned to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. “And you? Did you find a temple?” And one after another, he pinned down each devotee in the room. “And what didyoudo?” The devotees felt Prabhupāda’s anger. “I want a temple. Los Angeles must have a temple. There must be a place to worship the Deity.” That night he didn’t lecture.\nThree days later, the devotees found a new temple – a one-story church with three large rooms – the first really nice piece of property the International Society for Krishna Consciousness had ever acquired. The church had been used by a Japanese Baptist congregation and was located on La Cienega Boulevard in the middle of Los Angeles. In a neighborhood of brick buildings, stores, factories, and businesses, the wooden church stood on a little patch of grass. The rent was high – five hundred dollars a month – more than Prabhupāda had ever paid for a piece of property. Although Prabhupāda had acted noncommittal when the landlord had shown him the place, afterwards he told the devotees he wanted the place and they should get it. Dayānanda questioned the high rent, but Prabhupāda said they had waited long enough. Here was a good place, so they should get it.\nFor Prabhupāda this new temple marked the beginning of a new era for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. He wrote Kīrtanānanda Swami on December 8,\nThe devotees in New York had also acquired a new building, moving from 26 Second Avenue to a larger storefront two blocks up on Second Avenue. “I do not know how is your temple there,” Prabhupāda wrote Brahmānanda in New York. “I have heard that it is very nice, but I think that the temple here is probably nicer.” All devotees in other places, Prabhupāda said, should consider the new standard reached in Los Angeles. To Kṛṣṇadāsa in Germany Prabhupāda wrote,\nAnd he wrote to Jadurāṇī in Boston that for his large meeting hall he would need large paintings to decorate the hall.\nOn moving into the temple, the devotees called a press conference. They cooked a feast for a hundred people, rented chairs, but only one reporter came. The lone reporter pointed out their mistake in holding a press conference in the evening, after normal working hours. Prabhupāda spoke and then encouraged the assembled devotees to take the feast themselves. “In Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is never any failure. If people come to the program we preach, and if not, we takeprasāda.”\nWhen a reporter from theCosmic Starcame, Prabhupāda talked frankly with him about bogus swamis and “avatāras” from India. A reporter from theLos Angeles Timesinterviewed Prabhupāda on whether he thought man could land on the moon. Prabhupāda told the reporter to note down that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has nothing to do with going to the moon. The reporter had his own angle, and he printed an article in the December 28 issue of theL.A. Times,“Swami Says People Are Living on Moon”:\nThe devotees made plans for big Sunday festivals with puppet shows and theater performances. Bhavānanda, a new devotee and former New York textile designer, decorated and painted the temple with bright colors – pinks, purples, reds, blues, greens, and bright yellows. From theirkīrtanason the street thesaṅkīrtanadevotees began regularly bringing guests to visit the new temple. The devotees planted 108 rose bushes, on Prabhupāda’s request, throughout the temple grounds. Within a short time an altar was ready, and the devotees brought Lord Jagannātha and Kartā Mahāśaya.\n“Now we will begin full-scale Deity worship,” Prabhupāda said to some of the women. He talked of beginning something new in ISKCON – the daily offerings ofprasādamto the Deity and dailyāratis.\nAs the Los Angeles devotee community grew and prospered in its new setting, Prabhupāda gradually relinquished the management to his leading disciples. Even for outside speaking engagements, which were often late, disrupting Prabhupāda’s normal schedule, he sent his disciples in his stead. He wanted to spend his time writing books at his apartment. He said he would go to the temple three nights a week and to the festival on Sundays, but otherwise he would be inaccessible. Only his servants and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, with his daily reports on thesaṅkīrtanaparty, would see him in his apartment.\nBy December 1968 Prabhupāda was producing his books at double his normal rate. He was writing two books –Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of GodheadandThe Nectar of Devotion –and both he considered essential to the foundation of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.Kṛṣṇawas a translation and commentary of the Tenth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamcontaining the stories of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. Wanting colorful illustrations, Prabhupāda turned to the two or three artists among his disciples and challenged them. As fast as they would paint, he would write.\nPrabhupāda described each illustration he wanted. For the first picture, pregnant Devakī, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, should be sitting in the palace, and near the ceiling the demigods should be surrounding her, praying for Lord Kṛṣṇa’s appearance. Prabhupāda wanted Devakī in a different part of the palace for the second picture. Lord Viṣṇu in His four-armed form dressed in yellow appears before her while she and her husband, Vasudeva, bow down before Him. The third illustration would show baby Kṛṣṇa lying happily on the lap of Devakī, like an ordinary child. A fourth painting would show Vasudeva carrying baby Kṛṣṇa across the Yamunā River. The fifth would show Vasudeva at the house of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana, exchanging Kṛṣṇa for the newborn child of Yaśodā.\nKṛṣṇawould be a summary study. With translations and commentary blended into a single narrative, the style would be freer in this book than in his presentation of the First Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,but essentially it was the same work.\nHaving set such an ambitious life’s project as translating and commenting on the eighteen thousand verses ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,Prabhupāda was uncertain he would live to complete it. But the most important part ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamwas the Tenth Canto, because it contained Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental pastimes on earth. Therefore Prabhupāda wanted to render it into English right away. To finish the first nine cantos before beginning the Tenth would take years, and Prabhupāda didn’t know how many years he would have. But his disciples should at least have all the Tenth Canto pastimes of Kṛṣṇa.\n“The purpose of preparing this book,” Prabhupāda wrote in the Introduction toKṛṣṇa,“is primarily to induce people to understandkṛṣṇa-kathā,because thereby they can become free from material bondage.” Vyāsadeva, the compiler ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the original speaker ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,had recommendedkṛṣṇa-kathā,hearing and speaking about Kṛṣṇa, to clear the heart of all illusion. The transcendental pastimes ofKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godheadwere so powerful that simply by hearing, reading, and remembering them, a devotee would be transferred to the spiritual world.\nPrabhupāda’s normal working hours were in the early morning, beginning about one A.M., and he daily used this time for writingKṛṣṇa.But now he added a second intensive writing period in the afternoon and began another book,The Nectar of Devotion,a summary study of Rūpa Gosvāmī’sBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.This work contained “the complete science ofbhakti-yoga,” as taught by Lord Caitanya to Rūpa Gosvāmī five hundred years ago. Prabhupāda intendedThe Nectar of Devotionto be “the lawbook” for the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. If one wanted to know the philosophical basis ofbhakti-yoga,how to practice devotional service, what the stages of devotional service were, or what its goal was, he could find the answers by readingThe Nectar of Devotion.Specifically for devotees,The Nectar of Devotionwould help solidify the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the Western countries, whereBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhuwas virtually unheard of.\nIn the Introduction toThe Nectar of Devotion,Prabhupāda invoked auspiciousness upon his work: “Let His Lordship’s grace be on us so that there may not be any hindrance in the execution of this duty of writingThe Nectar of Devotion,impelled by His Divine Grace Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda worked from the original Sanskrit text and spoke into his dictating machine. Despite his age of seventy-three (Prabhupāda would often speak of himself as an old man, who could not eat like young men or endure a cold climate like his disciples), Prabhupāda now wrote more prolifically than ever before. His literary labors had begun in India as early as 1940, with hisBack to Godheadpaper. Now he had more facility for working – modern equipment for dictating, translating, and printing; personal assistants to tend to his meals and laundry; and energetic, trained disciples to conduct the missionary affairs of his movement. Material things, Rūpa Gosvāmī had stressed, should never be rejected when they can be used in the service of Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda applied this principle to his own situation and noted in one of the early chapters ofThe Nectar of Devotion,\nDay after day, Prabhupāda went deeply into the Vaiṣṇava literature, rendering the Sanskrit poetry of Vyāsadeva and the realizations of Rūpa Gosvāmī into modern English. Although externally his life may have appeared less eventful, he felt full urgency and satisfaction that he was making his most important contribution to the world. Sitting in a simple room in a small Los Angeles suburban house, he was presenting the foundation for a movement that could grow for thousands of years. He sensed the victory of Vedic enlightenment over the darkness of the age.\nEven Prabhupāda’s newest disciples understood they should not disturb their spiritual master’s concentration on his writing. “He’s really putting it out,” they said, and they were thrilled to hear the rate at which he was translating.\nConcerned about printing his upcoming books, Prabhupāda wrote Satsvarūpa in Boston.\nAnd to Haṁsadūta Prabhupāda wrote, “I next wish to publish a new book entitled Nectar of Devotion. So if you can help with these funds it would be very appreciated.”\nAlthough Prabhupāda’s book-writing was going well, the book production work by his disciples was not. Unpublished manuscripts piled up. Prabhupāda anticipated he had few years left, and he wanted to publish as many books as possible. Kṛṣṇa was empowering him to write two books simultaneously, but at the difficulty in scheduling the books for publication Prabhupāda became frustrated. Macmillan Company had recently finished printing 1,500 hardbound copies and 35,000 paperback copies ofBhagavad-gītā As It Is. Although Macmillan Company had abridged the originalGītāmanuscript more than fifty percent, it was nevertheless a victory for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement – the first authorized,paramparāedition ofBhagavad-gītāin the West. Although Macmillan Company would distributeBhagavad-gītā As It Isin the bookstores, Prabhupāda asked Brahmānanda to order five thousand copies for the temples to sell. He suggested that Brahmānanda approach as many book reviewers as possible, telling them this book was badly needed in today’s godless civilization. “Try for selling these books,” Prabhupāda wrote to the devotees in London. “It shall be considered of the greatest service.”\nWith this most basic book now available, Prabhupāda instructed his students to read at least one chapter a day and discuss it in class. “If you can simply cram Bhagavad Gita,” he wrote Haṁsadūta, “then you will surely become a very good preacher.”\nAn examination onBhagavad-gītāshould be held, Prabhupāda said, and those students who passed would receive the titlebhakti-śāstrī.When more books were available, he would hold a further exam based onBhagavad-gītā,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,Teachings of Lord Caitanya,andThe Nectar of Devotion,and those who passed would receive the title Bhaktivedanta. “I want that all my spiritual sons and daughters will inherit this title of Bhaktivedanta, so that the family transcendental diploma will continue through the generations. Those possessing the title of Bhaktivedanta will be allowed to initiate disciples. Maybe by 1975, all of my disciples will be allowed to initiate and increase the numbers of generations. That is my program. So we should not simply publish these books for reading by outsiders, but our students must be well versed in all of our books so that we can be prepared to defeat all opposing parties in the matter of self-realization.”\nPrabhupāda fretted while his manuscript forTeachings of Lord Caitanya –which was to have been printed at the same time as theGītā –met with delays at Dai Nippon Press in Japan. When the printers reported that the book would not be completed until next year, Prabhupāda again thought of his own press. Discussing his ideas with disciples, asking their opinions, he could see their lack of expertise and lack of money.\nAnother cause for concern was the backlog of unpublishedŚrīmad-Bhāgavatammanuscripts. Prabhupāda consideredŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamhis primary work, his life’s masterpiece. The lack of definite plans to publish it discouraged him and diminished his enthusiasm. He had vastly ambitious plans to flood the world with Kṛṣṇa conscious books, and he would be satisfied with nothing less.\nSo in January 1969, while daily experiencing the most productive period of book writing in his life, he nevertheless expressed feelings of anxiety and disappointment over the unpublishedŚrīmad-Bhāgavatammanuscripts. In writing to Brahmānanda, Prabhupāda explained that his life was dedicated to publishing theBhāgavatamand that, despite having hundreds of assistants and being in a wealthy country, he wasn’t able to do what he had accomplished singlehandedly in India.\nPrabhupāda decided to restrict his weekly temple visits to Sundays. For the devotees, Sunday became the high point of the week. Sunday was the focal point of the devotees’ preaching because all week they would invite people to the weekly festival, and all week Tamāla Kṛṣṇa would consult with Prabhupāda about the feast menu or the observance of various Vaiṣṇava holidays. Prabhupāda also suggested plays the devotees could perform.\nWhen Prabhupāda would arrive on Sunday, everyone would be waiting for him outside the temple, and they would begin singing and dancing as Prabhupāda’s car pulled up. As soon as he stepped out of the car, devotees garlanded him. Beside the temple hall was a little room to hear Prabhupāda talk about Kṛṣṇa or single out devotees and ask how they were doing. He was like a king among adoring subjects, a father of a family of sixty sons and daughters.\nThe atmosphere of the Sunday program was festive. More guests were coming than ever before in any of Prabhupāda’s other temples. The devotees so enthusiastically invited new people that gradually the Sunday feast attendance rose to two hundred.\nLeaving his little room, Prabhupāda would enter the temple hall, where he would lead the singing, accompanied by the devotees and guests. On one such occasion, during thekīrtana,Prabhupāda began to dance in a large circle around the room, moving slowly, majestically, his arms raised, inducing everyone to join. As he walked and danced the devotees and guests lined up and followed behind him. He stopped in front of each picture on the wall and danced with his side-to-side step, his arms upraised, robes swaying. Then he continued circumambulating the room. Among the guests that Sunday sat two old ladies in wooden chairs in the back of the room. When Prabhupāda came before them, they were smiling and nodding, enjoying the show. But Prabhupāda looked at them, raised his hands in the air, and called, “Stand up! Stand up and dance!” And they arose, started dancing, and followed him all around the room.\nAfter thekīrtanaPrabhupāda would sit and watch the devotees’ play – “Nārada and the Hunter” or “Prahlāda Mahārāja and Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva” – or he would watch Viṣṇujana’s puppet show. Then he would join the devotees for the Sunday feast.\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa:Śrīla Prabhupāda would eat with the devotees in the temple room at every feast. He would instruct us to first feed all the children. He said, “Children should be fed first.” Then we would all take. Later, after we would finish eating in front of him, he would instruct, “Give him more of this and more of that.” I would always sit toward the front. Then he would distribute hismahāplate.\nŚīlavatī:Devotees would line up along the steps and the walkway to Prabhupāda’s car. Prabhupāda would come out, and he would be smiling. All the devotees would bow down and then kneel as he came by, and he would put his hand on everyone’s head as he went by. Everyone was just waiting for Śrīla Prabhupāda to touch their head. And if he would miss someone when he went by, then that person would run around and get at the end of the line – somehow or other, so that Śrīla Prabhupāda would touch your head. I know he knew what was going on. He was just smiling. And sometimes he would just make a point to touch everyone’s head as he went by, and sometimes he would only touch two or three people in the whole line. It was just a game that we all played. Then he would get into the car, and everyone would just converge on the car. Then after he left everyone had something to say like, “Did you see him do this?” and “Did you hear him say this?” Everyone was so happy about Śrīla Prabhupāda. We would always talk about him. He was the center of our lives.\nAs a representative of the Los Angeles devotee community, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa visited Prabhupāda daily. Prabhupāda was especially interested in thesaṅkīrtanaparty. The traveling chanting party Prabhupāda had requested Tamāla Kṛṣṇa to form had been holdingkīrtanasin the streets of San Francisco and Seattle. Upon their arrival in Los Angeles, Prabhupāda asked them to stay as a part of the new Los Angeles center. Now, every day more than thirty devotees were going downtown, distributingBack to Godheadsand chanting for eight hours. Besides organizing the dailysaṅkīrtana,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa also maintained relations with police and city authorities. It was a success. Los Angeles was leading ISKCON in this newsaṅkīrtanapractice, and repeatedly Prabhupāda stressed this as the most important function of ISKCON.\nBecause Tamāla Kṛṣṇa was Prabhupāda’s man for organizing the devotees, Prabhupāda carefully trained him in managing. Sometimes Prabhupāda would show Tamāla Kṛṣṇa a letter he had received, asking for his response. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa would suggest a reply; then Prabhupāda would explain the particular answer this letter required.\nPrabhupāda usually ate his lunch alone, but one day he invited Tamāla Kṛṣṇa to have lunch with him. When theprasādamwas served, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa asked, “How should we eat, Prabhupāda? Which thing should we eat first?”\n“In eating,” Prabhupāda replied, “there is no hard and fast rule.” But Tamāla Kṛṣṇa watched his spiritual master takeprasādam,knowing there was an art to it. Whatever Prabhupāda would eat, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa would also eat, bite by bite. Prabhupāda encouraged him to eat to his full satisfaction.\nAfter eating and washing, Prabhupāda said, “Now let us talk a little.” The printers in Japan, he explained, had agreed to take a contract for printingBack to Godhead –on the condition that ISKCON order a minimum of twenty thousand magazines a month. “They are first-class printers,” Prabhupāda said, “so you just give me a guarantee. I want you to take five thousand magazines a month for Los Angeles. If you do, then I will arrange for San Francisco, New York, and London to each take five thousand. You just give me this guarantee.”\nImmediately Tamāla Kṛṣṇa promised Prabhupāda to distribute five thousand magazines a month. It was an important moment. “Now,” Prabhupāda said, “I can take the initiative to print such a big order. Otherwise, I could not do it.”\nOn another of Tamāla Kṛṣṇa’s daily visits, he showed Prabhupāda a painting just completed by Muralīdhara, a new devotee. The picture showed the spiritual sky and its spiritual planets, with the material world in one corner. Prabhupāda liked the painting. Referring to the painting, he explained to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa the plan of the total creation. Kṛṣṇa, he began, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is situated in the topmost planet, Kṛṣṇaloka. Around Kṛṣṇaloka are innumerable spiritual planets, residences of the four-handed Nārāyaṇa expansions of the Lord. The planets are all situated in the unlimited effulgence of the Brahman sky, which is actually the effulgence of Kṛṣṇa’s body. And in one tiny corner of this sky exists the entire material world. The material world emanates from Lord Kṛṣṇa’s expansion, Mahā-Viṣṇu, who lives in the Causal Ocean, emanating innumerable material universes from His breathing and from the pores of His body. Within each universe Mahā-Viṣṇu then further expands as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who generates the planets within the universe. The earth planet is situated in the middle planetary system and, in comparison to the entire universe, is as insignificant as a speck of dust. And yet on this speck of dust there are seven continents, Prabhupāda continued to explain, directing Tamāla Kṛṣṇa’s attention to the painting. “And out of all these different continents,” Prabhupāda said, “there is America, and even within America there are so many cities. And one of those cities is Los Angeles. So here in Los Angeles also there are many places, and then out of them one of them is our temple. And in this temple there is one Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. And he is thinking that he is very, very important.” Tamāla Kṛṣṇa was startled. Prabhupāda looked at him and simply smiled.\nIn Los Angeles Govinda dāsī continued as Prabhupāda’s secretary, with Upendra, his servant, giving him massage and cooking for him. Govinda dāsī’s husband, Gaurasundara, had reluctantly left to open a center in Hawaii. It had begun with Prabhupāda’s talking about Hawaii as a very likely place for a temple. He then prodded Gaurasundara day after day until finally he agreed to go there and preach.\nNow Prabhupāda was suggesting that Govinda dāsī join her husband. She preferred, however, to remain with Prabhupāda as secretary; she had been with him for over a year. But Prabhupāda insisted that she go. From New York Puruṣottama had written asking to come and serve Prabhupāda, and Prabhupāda had consented. When Prabhupāda had written the letter asking Puruṣottama to come, he had given it to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, saying, “You’d better mail this. Don’t give it to Govinda dāsī. She may refuse to mail it.”\nGovinda dāsī wanted to stay, but Prabhupāda ordered her: “You must live with your husband. That will make you happy. You will never be happy staying aloof from one another. You must go there.” So after weeks of procrastinating, Govinda dāsī reluctantly left her cherished service and went to join her husband.\nAlready inconvenienced by Gaurasundara’s departure, Prabhupāda was now further inconvenienced by the loss of his trained secretary. But he wanted new centers. Rendering personal service as secretary or servant was not a very important function, he said. But to go somewhere in the world and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness required a divine spirit, and whoever had this opportunity should take it as the greatest blessing from Kṛṣṇa.\nThen Upendra received a prison sentence for a previous drug conviction years ago, before he had joined Prabhupāda. At first the sentence was three months, but then it was reduced to one month in the county jail. When the day to leave came, Upendra packed his bag and went in to say goodbye to Prabhupāda.\n“Oh?” Prabhupāda smiled. “You are going now?”\n“Yes, Prabhupāda,” Upendra said with a broken voice. Then he asked, “Prabhupāda, will you please chant one round with me?”\nPrabhupāda looked at him steadily and said, “You should know that I am always chanting with you.”\nUpendra began to cry, and Prabhupāda reached over, patting his back and ruffling his hair. “No, don’t be afraid,” Prabhupāda assured him. “It is Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. They will think you are a pious boy and let you go out after a few days. Go on now. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and be happy.” Upendra took heart and left for jail. After ten days he was released and returned to Prabhupāda’s personal service.\nAt this time Prabhupāda began speaking to Upendra about preaching in Australia. A devotee in New York had written Prabhupāda about starting a center in Australia, mentioning Upendra’s name. At first Upendra was dead set against it, but Prabhupāda smiled gently and said, “Yes, I think you should go.”\n“But I am doing your cooking,” Upendra protested.\n“Oh, anyone can cook,” Prabhupāda replied. “You were doing better service in Seattle.”\n“You’re not joking then?” Upendra asked.\nNo, Prabhupāda wasn’t joking. And Upendra left for Australia.\nThus Prabhupāda gradually depleted his own personal staff in Los Angeles, but he continued to use the Los Angeles temple as a stage of introducing new, important aspects of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One such precedent had been the downtown chanting party. Another was full-scale Deity worship in the temple.\nIt was in Los Angeles at this time that devotees began a full day’s schedule ofāratisand offerings ofprasādamto the Deities, just as in the great Vaiṣṇava temples of India. Jīva Gosvāmī, a great scholar and follower of Lord Caitanya’s teachings, had written that although chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa was sufficient in itself for going back to Godhead, because people in the present age are restless, they should also worship the Deity, for purification. Since the Deity worship involved sewing dresses for the Deities, decorating and cleaning the Deities’ altar, and cooking for the Deities, Prabhupāda turned to some of his women disciples who seemed particularly inclined.\nOne of them was Śīlavatī. She was older than most of the other women and had joined the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement with her two sons. When Prabhupāda saw her eagerness to help him establish the Deity worship, he asked her to come to his apartment, where he explained to her the system of worshiping the Deity with six dailyāratis.\nThe firstārati, maṅgala-ārati,should be held one and a half hours before sunrise. But the Deities must first be awakened, then offered milk sweets and fruit, and then, atārati,consecutively offered burning incense, burning camphor, water in a conchshell, a clean handkerchief, a fragrant flower, a yak-tail whisk, and a peacock feather fan. The devotee offering the articles was thepūjārī.Thepūjārīwould ring a bell in his left hand while offering each object with his right hand, moving the article in clockwise circles before the Deities.\nBreakfast is offered to the Deities a few hours aftermaṅgala-ārati;afterward, all the devotees can take the remnants of that offering as the Deities’prasādam.Then anotherāratiis performed at noon, after which the devotees take the remnants for lunch. And there are three otherāratis –at four in the afternoon, at seven P.M., and another at nine P.M. Then the Deities take rest. Understanding that the Deity is actually the Lord and the proprietor of the temple, the devotees should serve Him just as a king is served in his palace. By doing this, the devotees would naturally increase their Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But it had to be done with enthusiasm. Prabhupāda cautioned that if enthusiasm waned, it could turn into drudgery and become like idol worship. The disciples would be sorry they had ever begun it.\nAfter being instructed by Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śīlavatī returned to the temple to prepare for the new worship procedure. Next Sunday, when Prabhupāda visited the temple, he stood and watched Śīlavatī offeringārati.Afterwards, when Śīlavatī joined the other devotees in Prabhupāda’s room adjacent the temple, Prabhupāda greeted her by saying, “Now we will haveārati.”\nŚīlavatī looked surprised. “Oh,” she said, “but I just hadārati.”\n“No you didn’t,” Prabhupāda said.\n“It wasn’t good?” she asked.\n“No, it wasn’t good.” Prabhupāda then went into the temple and asked the devotees to bring him the various articles for offeringārati.Standing before the altar, Prabhupāda called out, “I want camphor.”\n“What’scamphor?” the devotees asked. “Where do we getcamphor?”Someone immediately ran out to buy some. Then Prabhupāda asked for flowers. Item by item, theāratiparaphernalia came together, as Prabhupāda, standing before the altar, directed the devotees to bring him each item. When everything was finally assembled, Prabhupāda demonstrated howāratishould be done. Then again he turned it over to Śīlavatī. He had shown them, and now they should continue with enthusiasm.\nWhen Prabhupāda first introduced festivals and spiritual observances for the holidays on the Vaiṣṇava calendar, the devotees in Los Angeles were delighted. They would plan many of the Sunday festivals around a particular event. A butter-churning festival commemorated Kṛṣṇa’s activities as a cowherd boy; the celebration of Govardhana-pūjā observed Kṛṣṇa’s pastime of lifting Govardhana Hill; and festivals observed the appearance of Lord Rāma and Lord Nṛsiṁha, etc. These were not new ideas for Prabhupāda, but now for the first time he had facility and enthusiastic helpers to implement them.\nIn February, on the appearance day of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, Prabhupāda came to the temple and cooked potatoes and cauliflower, sweet rice,halavā,andpurīs.While the devotees crowded in the doorway, watching, Prabhupāda cooked with silent concentration, cleaning the stove and sink after each step.\nOne day Śīlavatī discovered a bud on one of the 108 rose bushes. She excitedly called some devotees to see. Soon the other bushes would bloom with flowers to offer to the Deity, and the devotees knew Prabhupāda would be pleased.\nŚīlavatī:Jayānanda planted 108 rose bushes, and we were all very anxious for the bushes to bloom. One day I found a little rosebud, and I was really excited. It was a yellow rose. I knew from the bud that the bush was going to be yellow and would have a particular fragrance like that flower. I felt that way about our temple. Maybe there were other temples that were bigger and grander, but the essence of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s vision was expressed in that temple. Just like with the rose bush you could tell the color and aroma of all the flowers on the bush, so from that temple we could derive the essence of this movement, what went on there.\nThe devotees were aware that their activities were successful model beginnings of what Prabhupāda would institute throughout America and the rest of the world. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had organizedBack to Godheadmagazine distribution so that the devotees, while out chanting in the streets, regularly sold an unprecedented one hundred magazines a day. Viṣṇujana was wonderful, singing and playingmṛdaṅgaall day long. Prabhupāda said he could leadkīrtanalike a Gandharva. And Viṣṇujana’s puppet shows and dramatic skits for the Sunday festivals were something new to ISKCON and well appreciated by the guests; they made the Sunday program not just a feast but a festival. And now Prabhupāda had introduced a higher standard of Deity worship.\nThe devotees were inspired to serve together in Prabhupāda’s presence, and they worked long hours together, not with an attitude of pride in their own achievement, but with an ésprit de corps. They worked hard, but it was all recreation; they saw their engagements as eternal devotional service, even though performed in the temporary setting of the one-story wooden church in the metropolis of Southern California.\nBut crucial to the success of the Los Angeles temple was Prabhupāda’s personal presence there. Only because he was there was everything so successful. Although the devotees only saw him once a week, they knew he was at his apartment on Hayworth Street, and they would soon see him again.\nPrabhupāda had been living in Los Angeles four months now, and almost since his arrival he had been considering leaving. He regularly received invitations from sincere disciples inspired with the “divine spirit” – the impetus to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That spirit had led disciples to different parts of the world as missionaries of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And Śrīla Prabhupāda, as the source of that spirit for his disciples, wanted to go be with them, to help them, and to strengthen whatever they had begun. He couldn’t remain in one place very long. He had to keep moving and, like a flying, dancing spark, ignite the fire of Kṛṣṇa consciousness wherever it would catch and in as many hearts as possible.\nThis spirit had especially manifested in Prabhupāda since his return to America in December 1967, after recuperating in India from his illness. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement only really began, he said, after he had returned to the United States. When he had come for the first time, he had been successful in beginning centers in New York and San Francisco; he had seen that young people would take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But then a heart attack had almost cost his life. He had at that time seemed a retired person returning home to India. But Kṛṣṇa had somewhat restored his health and allowed him to return to America. So now, with a new aggressiveness and with much more deliberate, active planning, he would open as many centers as possible.\nAt La Cienega Prabhupāda had finally received permanent residency status in the United States, recognized by the U.S. Immigration Department as an “Ordained Minister of Religion,” and he was now free to come and go. So Prabhupāda was eager and prepared to travel not only in the United States, but abroad. On Gaurasundara’s invitation he had been ready to go to Hawaii as early as December. But Tamāla Kṛṣṇa had pleaded with him to stay in Los Angeles and continue to inspire thesaṅkīrtanaparty. In January Prabhupāda wrote to the devotees in London.\nŚyāmasundara had written that Prabhupāda’s visit to London would be “the biggest event in London since the time of the Roman invasion.” Prabhupāda replied,\nBut Prabhupāda’s London preachers had not even managed to establish a center. They had been forced by circumstances to live separately, in different parts of the city. They had no place for Prabhupāda to stay. So Prabhupāda planned to visit other places, but he was most eager to go to London and declared himself fit in health and prepared for any climatic condition in England.\nFrom correspondence with Hayagrīva, now teaching English at Ohio State University, Prabhupāda learned of their newly formed Kṛṣṇa Yoga Society. Hayagrīva wanted to arrange a program for Prabhupāda to chant with Allen Ginsberg before a large group of students. Prabhupāda told Hayagrīva to set a date. He would go anywhere to preach.\nOn February 13 Prabhupāda wrote to Kṛṣṇadāsa in Germany: “I can immediately go to Germany. What is the temperature there now? The only problem is it should not be too cold for me. I am an old man.”\nDuring February Prabhupāda also suggested that his French-speaking disciple, Janārdana, go to Paris and start something there among his scholarly associates.\nIn Buffalo Rūpanūga had written Prabhupāda of his successful student center and the seventy-five students regularly attending his classes in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Prabhupāda wrote to Rūpanūga, “Regarding your desire to take me there for some time, it is long overdue, and if the climate is suitable, I can go even now if you think it is necessary.”\nGradually, Prabhupāda formed a full spring itinerary. “Considering the local climate as presented by you,” he wrote to Kīrtanānanda in New Vrindaban, “I think I shall postpone it until the end of April.” Similarly he promised Brahmānanda and Satsvarūpa to visit New York and Boston in the spring. From Hawaii Govinda dāsī promised the end of the rainy season, the beginning of the mango season, and local interest in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So by late February, Prabhupāda had a scheduled tour of about a dozen places, starting in early March with Hawaii.\nDuring Prabhupāda’s five months in Los Angeles, many devotees had joined. All of them had learned firsthand how, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, everything centered around Kṛṣṇa’s pure devotee, the spiritual master. Having had their spiritual master with them for so long, the thought of his absence was painful. He had taught them everything except how to continue without him. But Prabhupāda assured them that their service to him in separation was even higher service. Just as they wanted him to stay, so he also wanted to stay. But this traveling and preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world was his duty to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī – even at the risk of slackening his writing pace and leaving the ideal Kṛṣṇa conscious setting, where his 108 rose bushes were just beginning to bloom.\nBhavānanda:We all went to the airport to see Prabhupāda off. Prabhupāda was waiting for the plane, and then it was time to leave. He was with his new servants, Puruṣottama and Kartikeya, and we were all chanting and crying. Prabhupāda looked so bright as he walked down that little tunnel. He turned and waved, and then he just turned onto the plane. I was crying. I was thinking, “I’ve been looking for my spiritual master for so long, and now that I’ve finally found him, he’s leaving me. I will never see him again.”\nThen the plane was taxiing down the runway. It took off, and we were all looking out the windows of the terminal building until the last speck. Just like when Kṛṣṇa left thegopīsand went to Mathurā, we kept looking until the last speck of the airplane was gone."

        "content": "August 1969\nPRABHUPĀDA WANTED TO go to England. His obligations on the West Coast fulfilled, he was eager to travel and preach on a new continent. But his disciples in England, although creating a significant impression on London, hadn’t yet found a temple. The three couples were living in three different apartments around the city; still, after a year, they had no center.\nBut in Germany young Śivānanda had opened a little storefront temple within a few months of his arrival. Prabhupāda decided to go as soon as possible to Śivānanda in Germany, and from there go to England when they were ready for him. In July he wrote Kṛṣṇadāsa, who had joined Śivānanda, “You wanted to fix up a date, so I am telling you that I am prepared now on any day you call me.”\nOnly four disciples and a few friends were in Hamburg. At first they became a little bewildered, although blissful, to hear Prabhupāda wanted to come. They weren’t sure they had enough money. Would they have to pay his ticket all the way from California? And his secretary’s ticket? All they had was a tiny storefront – where would Prabhupāda stay? Not many people attended their temple programs, so what would Prabhupāda do in Hamburg? Prabhupāda sensed their confusion when they sent a discount Icelandic Airlines ticket to him at the wrong address in California. He wrote them on August 5,\nIn 1968 in Montreal, when he had heard Śrīla Prabhupāda talk about bringing Kṛṣṇa consciousness to London, Śivānanda had asked to go. At first, however, Prabhupāda had doubted whether such a young, inexperienced boy should go alone to a foreign country as Śivānanda was proposing. But when Śivānanda had persisted, Prabhupāda had allowed him, although warning, “Be careful. I was an old Calcutta boy when I came to New York, and I never got cheated.”\nŚivānanda had had very little money, but in August 1968, his mother had paid for his trip to England. London immigration authorities had refused him entry, and he had gone to Amsterdam. There he had drawn public attention and press coverage by dressing in adhotīand chanting in public. He had sent Prabhupāda the news clippings as well as a letter expressing enthusiasm, and loneliness.\nTouched by Śivānanda’s bold pioneering spirit, Prabhupāda had written him as spiritual father to son.\nPrabhupāda proudly held up the example of young Śivānanda before his other disciples. When a few devotees traveled for the first time to Vancouver, Canada, found a poor reception, and wrote Prabhupāda that they were giving up on Vancouver, Prabhupāda wrote them about Śivānanda. “You will be pleased that his little activities for a few days are now published in a local paper with his photo. And although he is alone, I think his journey to Europe is a successful one by this time. And similarly wherever we go we must not come back defeated. That is my idea. So I think Śivānanda’s enclosed copy of letter will encourage you.”\nŚivānanda had traveled from Amsterdam to Berlin, where he had rented a storefront. Prabhupāda had followed his success with great interest.\nUpon Śivānanda’s arrival in Germany, he had soon been joined by a German-speaking American boy, Kṛṣṇadāsa, and a German devotee, Uttamaśloka, who had both been living in California. Kṛṣṇadāsa, only eighteen, had been working as a jeweler’s apprentice in San Francisco and felt confident he could get similar work in Germany to support the temple there. Now they had jointly decided to close the Berlin center and move to Hamburg. But Prabhupāda’s growing hopes for attracting the intelligent people of Germany had been threatened in December when he had received a distressful letter from Śivānanda saying he was going to leave Europe. This was five months after his arrival. Prabhupāda had replied,\nŚivānanda agreed to stay.\nAt this time also Prabhupāda had written another young disciple, Acyutānanda, who was experiencing difficulty alone in India. Prabhupāda had asked him also not to abandon his position. Mostly Prabhupāda’s letters to his disciples were to encourage them in what they were already doing, but at times like these he had to tell them to stick it out and not leave. To have even one man in a foreign country was very important. Even if Śivānanda didn’t do much active preaching, if a sincere disciple simply stayed somewhere, then things would grow. So Śivānanda had stayed.\nHamburgAugust 25, 1969Prabhupāda and Puruṣottama flew from Los Angeles to New York, stopped over for twenty-four hours, and then flew by Lufthansa Airlines nonstop to Hamburg. The stewardesses wanted to give them cooked meals and seemed personally disappointed when Prabhupāda wouldn’t take them. They asked if he would take fruits and then produced a good variety. Prabhupāda accepted.\nWhen Prabhupāda and Puruṣottama arrived in Hamburg, Śivānanda, Kṛṣṇadāsa, and two other boys were at the airport to greet them. They had a taxi waiting. The weather was gray and cold, despite the season. As the taxi passed the streets lined with close, neat homes, Prabhupāda said it reminded him of Calcutta – when the Europeans had gone to India, they had built houses similar to these.\nThe temple was on Eppendorfer Weg, in a business area, next to a hair salon. The storefront, with its plate glass window painted blue except for an oval in the center, and “Radha Krishna Tempel” painted over the window, could have been in New York or San Francisco except for the sign, “Internationale Gesellschaft für Krischna Bewußtsein e.V.”\nThe apartment Śivānanda had rented for Prabhupāda was two small rooms on the fifteenth floor of a modern building across the street from the storefront. Śivānanda and a few others came before Prabhupāda in his room, and Śivānanda apologized that Kṛṣṇa consciousness was so small in Hamburg. They had heard how devotees in Los Angeles were going out, sometimes fifty at a time, chanting and dancing in the streets and distributing hundreds ofBack to Godheads.But in Hamburg Śivānanda and another boy had gone out chanting only a few times, with little success. They had no speaking engagements for Prabhupāda, Śivānanda said, and they weren’t sure if many people would attend the temple lectures, although they had advertised around town with posters. Prabhupāda smiled and sat back. “That’s all right.” And he began talking with Uttamaśloka about his progress in translatingBhagavad-gītāAs It Isinto German.\nWith Puruṣottama busy typing Prabhupāda’s translations and letters, Śivānanda did most of the personal service for Prabhupāda – cooking, accompanying Prabhupāda on his morning walk, giving him his daily massage. Puruṣottama looked rather gloomy; he seemed unhappy to be in Hamburg, perched high in a skyscraper under a gray north German sky, with a tiny temple and almost no devotees. But Śivānanda was exuberant; it seemed that Prabhupāda had come to ISKCON Hamburg just to give him the mercy of his personal association.\nIn his room, Prabhupāda told Śivānanda he would lecture in the temple on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. He would see guests in the afternoon – the two devotees ready for initiation, some regular visitors who wanted to see Prabhupāda, and a young Indologist, Dr. Franz Bernhardt, who had an academic interest in seeing Prabhupāda. Prabhupāda then began speaking about how intelligent Germans were. He said among Europeans, German scholars were the most adept in Sanskrit; they had a lively interest in Indian philosophy. Prabhupāda had a German Godbrother who had come to India and been initiated by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, so he had heard something about German culture from his Godbrother.\nAs for manufactured products, he continued, if something was made in Germany, it was first class; the next best was Japanese, and then American. He said the Hamburg devotees should strive to establishsaṅkīrtanahere as it was in the U.S. He described how the Los Angeles temple was decorated and how hundreds of people came to the Sunday Love Feasts. They should make their temple in Germany even more important than the one in Los Angeles. And they should go out and distribute magazines, and from the collections support the center. He said they should at least go out an hour a day. If the devotees really wanted to remain in Germany, they should try to learn the German language. Although German was a foreign language to some of the Hamburg devotees, Prabhupāda said that somehow they had to present the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the German people. He gave the example that if in a foreign country a man discovers fire in the building, he has to get help from the neighbors, even though he doesn’t know their language. He may not express himself in good language, but that’s not important. Because of the urgency of the situation, he can still get his message across. Similarly, the material world is the blazing fire ofmāyā,and a devotee has to inform the people, even if he has to use broken language.\nA friendly German husband and wife entered the room and sat in the back. The girl told Prabhupāda she enjoyed reading his bookTeachings of Lord Caitanya.Prabhupāda was very glad and said that both she and her husband should read the books carefully and then preach the teachings of Lord Caitanya to the Europeans. Hours went by, while Prabhupāda painted a realistic but vigorous vision of how these few devotees could use their energies in spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Germany.\nThe next day he went out for a walk, accompanied by a few devotees. Prabhupāda wore a turtleneck sweater and a large black coat, but no hat. He carried a cane. The boys were dressed in pants, coats, and hats, except Kṛṣṇadāsa, who wore a suit and tie, since he would have to go to work at the jeweler’s shop after the walk. Śivānanda took Prabhupāda to the Hamburg harbor, Landungsbrücken, on the Elbe River. The weather was still gray, damp, and – for August – cold. People driving by turned, looking at Prabhupāda, and even stopped their cars to stare. Prabhupāda was himself very surprised to see some ditch-diggers pausing to drink beer at this early hour. “They are drinking beer already?” He turned to Śivānanda.\n“Yes, Prabhupāda,” Śivānanda replied, “they begin very early.” Then Prabhupāda saw one billboard after another, many advertisingZigaretten(“cigarettes”). He exclaimed, “Oh,Zigaretten!”\n“Why are these people so fat?” Prabhupāda asked.\n“Oh, they eat a lot of potatoes,” Śivānanda replied.\n“No,” Prabhupāda said, “they eat a lot of meat.”\nThe Germans may be the most intelligent Europeans, Prabhupāda said, but they were also the most materially attached. Prabhupāda and his students stopped to watch a tugboat towing a large oceanliner into the harbor. “Just see,” Prabhupāda said, “a man under the spell ofmāyāis just like this big oceanliner. The tugboat is small, but because the big oceanliner has its engine off, the little boat can drag it. Similarly, the soul without Kṛṣṇa is pulled bymāyādown to hell.”\nAs they continued walking they came upon an open vegetable market. “Let’s go see what they have,” Prabhupāda said. Carefully he observed the selection of fruits and vegetables, paying close attention to details.\nAs they started back, Prabhupāda said, “This morning I will have eggplantpakorāsand hot milk. It is very good for cold weather. It helps keep you warm.”\n“Hot milk, Prabhupāda?” Śivānanda asked.\n“Yes. Milk means hotcow’smilk.”\nAs they approached the storefront Prabhupāda remarked, “TheseZigarettensare very popular.”\nFor the rest of the day Prabhupāda read, took breakfast, answered letters, took massage at eleven, bathed, took lunch, rested an hour, and then received visitors in the afternoon. In the evening he came down to the temple and lectured onBhagavad-gītā.Although Maṇḍalībhadra was there ready to translate Prabhupāda’s words into German, there was no need, since everyone in the audience spoke English.\nOne of the few guests attending Prabhupāda’s lecture was the landlady. She was in her eighties, lonely, and glad to have young people living in her building. Sitting behind a partition where Prabhupāda could not see her, she listened to the lecture. When Prabhupāda got up from thevyāsāsanaand walked to the back of the room, he found her sitting there. “Oh,” he said, “the landlady is a devotee too?”\nŚivānanda had no experience arranging lectures for Prabhupāda, nor did he have the time. He was busy cooking and doing other duties for Prabhupāda. Kṛṣṇadāsa worked full-time. Under the circumstances, Professor Bernhardt’s visit was the major “outside” engagement for Prabhupāda during his Hamburg visit. Śivānanda had met Professor Bernhardt months ago at the University of Hamburg after hearing of a Sanskrit and Indology professor on campus. Without knowing anything about the etiquette of dealing with a professor, he had entered Dr. Bernhardt’s office without an appointment.\n“We are going to start a Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple here,” Śivānanda had told the professor. “Are you familiar with the Vedic scriptures?”\nAlthough Professor Bernhardt remained strictly formal with Śivānanda, he couldn’t deny an academic interest in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He had studied Vaiṣṇavism, specializing in Indian religious festivals. So when Śivānanda invited him to come and meet Bhaktivedanta Swami, Professor Bernhardt had eagerly taken the opportunity.\nProfessor Bernhardt, a well-dressed young man with wavy blond hair, sat patiently through one of Prabhupāda’skīrtanasand lectures in the temple. Afterwards, in fluent English, he asked, “What about we here in the city who have cosmopolitan consciousness?”\n“What is this cosmopolitan consciousness?” Prabhupāda asked. “They are killing the animals.” Prabhupāda explained to him the universality of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n“I am interested,” Dr. Bernhardt said, “to learn about the differences between the Śaṅkarites and the Vaiṣṇavas and their philosophies.”\n“Oh, yes,” Prabhupāda replied. “I will teach you.” And they agreed to meet again at Prabhupāda’s apartment.\nKṛṣṇadāsa:A couple of days after Prabhupāda arrived in Hamburg, Dr. Bernhardt came laden with gifts. He was very conscious of Vaiṣṇava protocol. Even if he were in the Himalayas in this cold, horrendous weather, he would be freshly shaven and wearing a tie. He was very punctual and precise. Prabhupāda talked with him, and the entire conversation was in Sanskrit. As a matter of fact, every now and then Prabhupāda would put in a couple of words of English for our benefit. For three or four days there were continual meetings between Prabhupāda and Dr. Bernhardt. They culminated in a statement by Dr. Bernhardt. He lapsed into English and said, “What you are saying is that all my knowledge is useless without devotional service.” Prabhupāda said, “Yes, now you’ve understood.” Then Dr. Bernhardt said, “What you’re saying is that all my studies and entire library are just like an ass laden down with so many books that are ultimately pushing him to his grave.” Again Prabhupāda said, “Yes, that is right.”\nWhen Dr. Bernhardt remarked that he had been thinking of ISKCON as hippies since he had seen an ad stating that Allen Ginsberg was a member, Prabhupāda took it very seriously. The next day he wrote Hayagrīva.\nPrabhupāda’s third meeting with Dr. Bernhardt was at the professor’s home. This time Dr. Bernhardt confessed to Prabhupāda that he did not agree with many points in Prabhupāda’s translations of the Vedic literatures. He criticized the Vaiṣṇava philosophy. He also told Prabhupāda that he had no religious feeling for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, since he considered himself a Christian. By the end of this meeting their relationship was becoming strained, and afterwards Prabhupāda remarked that in none of their meetings had the professor even said Hare Kṛṣṇa.\nSeptember 3, 1969Within a week of Prabhupāda’s arrival in Germany, the Janmāṣṭamī holiday occurred. Prabhupāda observed Janmāṣṭamī, Kṛṣṇa’s birthday, quietly, not like the previous year in Montreal, when hundreds of Indians had gathered along with disciples from many temples. Here there were only about half a dozen devotees on hand. They fasted and then came to Prabhupāda’s apartment in the evening. Prabhupāda talked about Kṛṣṇa, and they chanted together. Then at eleven-thirty P.M. Prabhupāda decided to have his head shaved – something he usually did once a month. Kṛṣṇadāsa carefully shaved his spiritual master’s head, while the others sat and watched. Although it was not the customary activity of Janmāṣṭamī night, the devotees loved associating with Prabhupāda in this intimate way. Then at midnight Prabhupāda went with them to the temple, where they broke their fast.\nThe next day was Vyāsa-pūjā day, the celebration of Prabhupāda’s seventy-fourth birthday. That morning a package arrived from New York containing several copies of the Vyāsa-pūjā booklet, a twenty-five-page paperback filled with homages from Prabhupāda’s disciples.\nMonths before, one of the devotees had discovered an old issue of a magazine published by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī; the magazine contained a Vyāsa-pūjā homage Prabhupāda had written commemorating the appearance day of his own spiritual master. When the article had been brought to Prabhupāda’s attention, he said that his disciples could also write their own appreciations, just as he had done forty years before. So the devotees in New York had gathered offerings from seventeen different temples and had printed them all in a Vyāsa-pūjā booklet.\nPrabhupāda was very pleased to receive the little booklet, and he had one of the devotees read it aloud in the temple. When all the readings were finished, he explained how service and prayers were accepted by Kṛṣṇa through the medium of the disciplic succession. Although outsiders might think that, “This man is becoming flattered in hearing his own eulogy,” the real meaning of Vyāsa-pūjā homage is that it is a test of how well the disciples were understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness and serving the spiritual master. Their praises were all going to the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the disciplic succession. And such praises were required training for the disciple, just as officers train soldiers in the military. But in this case, the training was in the feelings of pure consciousness.\nSitting on thevyāsāsana,Prabhupāda looked out at his little band of disciples sitting before him on the linoleum floor of the well-lit storefront. “I thank you for improving Kṛṣṇa consciousness,” he said. “I am asannyāsī,so I have come here empty-handed. You are providing for me. What can I do? I can simply pray to Kṛṣṇa for you. But don’t be satisfied that you have understood. This knowledge should be distributed. In my old age I have come to your country, carrying the order of my spiritual master to distribute. You are all young boys and girls, so take this and distribute it to the whole humanity. They will be happy.”\nThat morning Prabhupāda initiated five devotees: three regularbrahmacārīs –Vāsudeva, Ramantu, and Sucandra – who had all been chanting and serving for almost a year, and to the surprise of the other devotees, a married couple who had only recently been visiting the temple. When one of the devotees questioned the couple’s eligibility, Prabhupāda said that as long as they were chanting and following the four rules, they were eligible. Prabhupāda named the couple Viśvanātha and Kuntī. He told the new initiates that if they would keep always in contact with the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, they would be always purified. He compared the purification required before one could enter the spiritual world to the adjustment required by astronauts before they could enter the moon. “But as far as we are concerned, we don’t think that they were actually successful.”\nPrabhupāda also told the initiates that on behalf of Kṛṣṇa he was working to distribute knowledge, and that those who were actually fortunate would take it. “Our job is to teach people and give practical suggestion,” Prabhupāda explained. “Those who are fortunate will take; otherwise we shall go on canvassing.” Each person was independent and could take or not. Although God would never interfere with their independence, they should understand that the proper use of their independence was to become unalloyed servants of God.\nPrabhupāda was giving his new disciples what he knew to be the sublime gift for human life. But they were all individual spirit souls, free agents, and they had to decide out of their own free will to surrender to Kṛṣṇa or not. In the case of Viśvanātha and Kuntī, Prabhupāda was obviously taking a risk, but he wanted to give them the chance.\nEvery morning Prabhupāda would take a stroll to one of the nearby parks, sometimes with a few disciples and sometimes with only Śivānanda. Sometimes while he walked along the waterfront, Prabhupāda would ask about shipbuilding and related industries, and Kṛṣṇadāsa would answer. When Prabhupāda asked Kṛṣṇadāsa what the population of Hamburg was, he knew. Prabhupāda began to jokingly call Kṛṣṇadāsa “Stats,” because he knew so many statistics.\nOne morning, while Stats was answering Prabhupāda’s questions about various cranes used in shipbuilding, Prabhupāda turned to the others and said, “You see, although I am theguruand I am taking you back to Godhead, that doesn’t mean that I cannot learn from him.”\nAnother morning Prabhupāda and Śivānanda were walking alone in the park. Because of Śivānanda’s tight schedule and lack of sufficient sleep, he was feeling tired. Prabhupāda noticed Śivānanda’s fatigue and suggested they sit down on a park bench. Prabhupāda sat down carefully, while Śivānanda sprawled. Exchanging looks with Śivānanda, Prabhupāda sat forward even straighter, removing his back from the backrest. Seeing the great contrast in their sitting postures, Śivānanda sat up straight.\nBack in the temple, Śivānanda told the devotees about the incident. The next day, when Prabhupāda went on his walk, about five devotees accompanied him to the park. Again Prabhupāda said, “All right, let’s sit down here.” The two park benches faced each other, and as Prabhupāda sat down carefully with his back straight, all the devotees sat very straight opposite him on the bench, looking over at Prabhupāda. Seeing his disciples sitting seriously in a rigid line, in an obvious imitation of himself, Prabhupāda began to laugh.\nOne morning Prabhupāda and a few devotees walked past a church situated on its own plot of land, surrounded by several other buildings belonging to the church. Admiring the communitylike arrangement, Prabhupāda said to Śivānanda, “So you will get this church for us?”\n“I will see, Prabhupāda.”\n“In India,” Prabhupāda said, “there are situations very similar to this. There is a temple, and around the temple all the devotees are living. It’s a nice situation.”\nAnother morning Prabhupāda remarked about the extraordinary amount of garbage in front of the houses. Śivānanda explained that this was a monthly function in German cities, a throw-out day, when everybody puts out junk and things from their attic that the garbage collectors ordinarily do not take. On throw-out day the garbage collectors come with a special truck and remove all oversized garbage. Prabhupāda noticed all sorts of usable items, and as he walked, he would point with his cane: “Why don’t you take that for the temple?”\n“Well, Prabhupāda, we already have one of those.”\nAfter a while Prabhupāda would investigate another person’s garbage and point with his cane. “Yes, get that. Get that.” Repeatedly Śivānanda explained that the temple already had the articles. But Prabhupāda continued to point things out. Finally Prabhupāda found an Oriental rug sitting on the curb. “Yes, nowthisyou can use.” And Prabhupāda had them carry the rug back to the temple. The rug turned out to be in such good shape that, after cleaning it, they placed it in the temple room.\nThe weather continued cold and overcast, with only about two days of sunshine during Prabhupāda’s three-week stay. After a walk one cold, drizzly morning, while Prabhupāda was waiting with Śivānanda for the elevator, Śivānanda was rubbing his hands together. “You’re cold,” Prabhupāda said. And he touched Śivānanda’s hands. “Feel my hand.” It was warm. “If you keep this area of the body warm” – Prabhupāda put his hands on his chest – “then the rest of the body will be warm.” Śivānanda could not help but feel overwhelming affection for Prabhupāda, even in such small reciprocations. Every morning walk would reveal many such treasurable little incidents.\nŚivānanda was not an experienced cook, so Prabhupāda taught him. The apartment kitchen was small, about six feet square, with an electric stove, a sink, and a little counter space. When Prabhupāda said that Śivānanda made good eggplantpakorās,Śivānanda made eggplantpakorāsdaily. Then one morning Prabhupāda asked, “You’re not cooking that eggplant again, are you?”\nPrabhupāda then taught Śivānanda some other things to cook, including a special way to cook cabbage, a way to cookcapātīsby cooking them on one side in the oven, taking them out, and then cooking them on the other side on the electric burner. Prabhupāda asked for mangoes, but it was difficult to find them in Hamburg. Those that Śivānanda could find were still green. Prabhupāda instructed Śivānanda to put the peeled mangoes in a sugar solution for a week; when the mangoes turned black, they became a kind of mango chutney.\nŚivānanda knew Prabhupāda’s concern for not wasting anything, so he asked him what to do with the mango peels. Prabhupāda seemed surprised, but he said, “If you want to do something with the peels, then put them in mustard oil with salt and turmeric.” The devotees tried this, but they found the taste awful – except for Maṇḍalībhadra, who liked them.\nFor breakfast Śivānanda would usually take whatever was left on Prabhupāda’s plate, but one morning there was very little left, so Śivānanda began cooking cereal for himself. He had just begun eating the cereal in the other room when Prabhupāda entered. Prabhupāda took one look at Śivānanda’s cereal and told him to come into the kitchen. There Prabhupāda showed Śivānanda how to makehalavā,cooking farina and butter and mixing it with boiling sugar water. “When you want something to eat,” Prabhupāda said, “then you can make thishalavā.”\nPrabhupāda still had his small Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities in Hamburg, and They sat on the little altar shelf within his closet. Whatever Śivānanda would cook, Prabhupāda would have him make up a plate and then bring it and offer it with prayers to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. One day, while Śivānanda was cooking, Prabhupāda came to the kitchen door and motioned for Śivānanda to come out. He then led Śivānanda to the open closet before the Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Gesturing to the Deities, Prabhupāda said, “It’s not for me that you’re cooking, but it’s for Them.”\nPrabhupāda had come to Hamburg knowing the center was undeveloped. But he wanted to encourage the devotees there and give Śivānanda the opportunity to serve him personally. On Prabhupāda’s behalf Śivānanda had so submissively come here and started the center; now Prabhupāda had come to encourage him by engaging him as his walking companion, cook, and masseur.\nOne day Śivānanda was massaging Prabhupāda’s head when Prabhupāda began to explain that as a person gets older, the body does not digest food as well. The stomach begins producing bad airs, but by massage these airs become redistributed. Śivānanda became concerned and thoroughly absorbed himself in giving Prabhupāda his massage.\nEvery day at eleven Śivānanda would come in and give Prabhupāda his massage. One morning he entered the room and found Prabhupāda sitting in a chair by the window, his head covered with a blanket, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa on his beads. “You should pray to Kṛṣṇa for me,” Prabhupāda said to Śivānanda. Śivānanda was surprised; how could he pray for his spiritual master? He began to stammer, “Well, Prabhupāda, … I don’t … I don’t think it would work.”\n“Why not? You are a devotee of Kṛṣṇa.”\nAnother time Prabhupāda asked Śivānanda to massage around his heart. He asked him to push hard. Śivānanda thought he was rubbing Prabhupāda too hard, but Prabhupāda said, “Just push harder.” Śivānanda asked Prabhupāda if his health was all right, but Prabhupāda seemed annoyed that he had asked.\nAgain Śivānanda expressed remorse. “It must not be very good for you here in Hamburg,” he said. “You were staying in Los Angeles, and there were so many devotees there, and the situation was so nice. Now you’ve come here, and there’s practically nobody.”\n“That’s all right,” Prabhupāda said softly. “We are doing our preaching work whether there are a lot of devotees or not.”"

        "content": "IN THE SPRING of 1972, after conducting ground-breaking ceremonies at his three new projects in Māyāpur, Vṛndāvana, and Bombay, Śrīla Prabhupāda left India for a world preaching tour. The contested Bombay land purchase had turned into a drawn-out struggle that drew Śrīla Prabhupāda’s thoughts anxiously to Bombay wherever he traveled. Yet he preached with full presence of mind – from Australia to Hong Kong to Tokyo to Hawaii to Los Angeles. While in Los Angeles, Prabhupāda decided to visit Mexico, where his disciples had maintained an ISKCON center for a year.\nMexico CityJune 2, 1972Accompanied by his secretary, Śyāmasundara, and his servant, Nanda-kumāra, Śrīla Prabhupāda flew into Mexico City in the afternoon. When they disembarked, no devotees were in sight. While his secretary and servant speculated on the circumstances, Śrīla Prabhupāda, appearing tired, sat down on his suitcase and chanted, waiting.\nAfter almost an hour a Mexican couple approached. As the woman bowed down before Prabhupāda, the man introduced himself. He was Mr. Araiza, a lawyer, and the lady Mrs. Adela Diaz. They knew the Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees and recognized their spiritual master, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Having just come from the temple, the couple told Prabhupāda of the devotees’ preparation for his arrival. Śrīla Prabhupāda smiled and said he was waiting for his disciples to come and get him. Mrs. Diaz offered to take Śrīla Prabhupāda and his party to the temple in her car, and he agreed. Somehow they all squeezed into her small red car and headed for the city.\n“It is a shame they have missed you,” Mrs. Diaz said. “Citsukhānanda, the temple president, has decorated a large car with flowers to receive you at the airport.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda commented drily, “What good is a big car if it is not here?”\nThey arrived at the ISKCON center just as Citsukhānada and a party of devotees were arriving at the airport.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda entered the temple through the kitchen door. A single devotee was cooking. Startled to see Prabhupāda, the devotee offered frantic obeisances before him, and Prabhupāda asked, “Where are the devotees?” Mr. Araiza and Mrs. Diaz escorted him into the main room, a large, open area where devotees and dozens of guests were waiting. When the people saw Prabhupāda, they began to kneel before him with folded hands in the style of Catholic worshipers. He walked forward, pausing to gently touch their heads. A rain of flower petals caused Prabhupāda to look up. From the balcony railing of the second floor mezzanine devotees showered flowers upon Prabhupāda and his party. Ornate flower arrangements decorated the walls. One arrangement formed figures of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and another the words of themahā-mantra.“They are very artistic,” Prabhupāda appreciated, “just like in India.”\nBelatedly, devotees rushed in from the airport. Conchshells blew,kīrtanabegan. Citsukhānanda arrived, breathless and apologetic, and offered obeisances before Prabhupāda.\n“You have created a very nice transcendental atmosphere,” Prabhupāda said to him.\n“Oh, Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Citsukhānanda replied, “it is only because you are here that it is very nice. Otherwise, I cannot do anything.”\nCitsukhānanda showed Śrīla Prabhupāda to a room on the second floor, where on an altar small deities of Jagannātha, Subhadrā, and Baladeva stood. The freshly painted floor hadn’t dried, and a devotee spread a cloth for Prabhupāda so he could stand before the deities. Although the paint was tacky, Prabhupāda pushed the cloth away and paid obeisances on the floor, which retained the faint imprint of his soles and body.\nReturning to the main room, Prabhupāda sat on his decoratedvyāsāsanaand spoke to the waiting guests and devotees. After a short lecture, translated phrase by phrase by Lakṣmīpriyā dāsī, Prabhupāda retired to his room. It was about 6:00 P.M. While Prabhupāda rested, the devotees and guests, now numbering several hundred, gathered in the main hall below Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room and began a mightykīrtana.After an hour they were still going strong. After two hours Prabhupāda’s servant came out on the balcony and shouted down, “Stop thekīrtana!” The chanting subsided, and the servant went back into Prabhupāda’s room.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda asked from his bed, “Why have they stopped thekīrtana?”\n“I thought it was keeping you awake, Prabhupāda,” Nanda-kumāra said.\n“I can rest withkīrtana,”Prabhupāda said pleasantly. “It doesn’t bother me. It is transcendental. Tell them to go on.”\nNanda-kumāra then reappeared on the balcony above the crowd and called down, “Prabhupāda wants to know why thekīrtanastopped. So start it up again.”\nThe crowd cheered and again began chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, creating waves of blissful sound vibration that rang through the building. Even in the privacy of his room, Prabhupāda was enjoying a unique reciprocation with the people of Mexico on his first evening in their country – through the medium of the holy name.\nJune 3The next morning, Saturday, in the first initiation ceremony in Latin America, Śrīla Prabhupāda accepted eight Mexican disciples. He spoke about the mission of Lord Caitanya and then named the initiates after devotees from the pastimes in Caitanya-līlā. Śrīla Prabhupāda explained how Lord Caitanya had turned the nondevotees into devotees during His travels throughout India. Now Prabhupāda was himself extending the boundaries of that preaching mission into a new continent, making devotees for Lord Caitanya wherever he went.\nPrabhupāda had never before met the devotees he was about to initiate, but he was accepting them on recommendation from the temple president, who confirmed that they had all been chanting sixteen rounds and following the four regulative principles for at least six months. Of all the candidates, only one young man, a worker in the devotees’ incense business, lived outside the temple, but he also had shaved his head and was eager to accept initiation. When he came before Śrīla Prabhupāda to receive his beads, Prabhupāda asked him, “Do you want a spiritual life or a material life?”\nThe young man was surprised, since Śrīla Prabhupāda hadn’t asked anyone else. He thought a moment. “I want a spiritual life.”\n“That’s all right,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he gave him the beads.\nThen Śrīla Prabhupāda turned to Hanumān Goswami and asked him to lecture. After a few minutes of speaking, Hanumān launched into a long, involved story, without any reference tośāstra.Śrīla Prabhupāda sat tolerantly. After some minutes, however, he interrupted sternly, “Stop this nonsense story. Speak from theBhāgavatam.”Hanumān Goswami doubled up as if punched in the stomach by Prabhupāda’s words, but then he sat upright and continued speaking in strictparamparā.\nAfter the initiation, Prabhupāda instructed Hanumān further. “Why did you not speak of the ten offenses?” he asked. “This is not very good to speak some nonsense story. When we take initiation, better to give them the most important things, how to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and the ten offenses. What is the use of these other things?”\n“Oh?” Prabhupāda replied. “How many people will watch?”\n“About thirty million. It’s the most popular show.”\n“Thirty million?” Śrīla Prabhupāda’s eyes widened. “Then we must go.”\n“But Prabhupāda, you won’t be able to get off the program until maybe one or two in the morning.”\nPrabhupāda: “That’s all right. We can sleep during the day.” Śrīla Prabhupāda was not at all reluctant, as he had seen that the people were eager to hear him. The great response they had shown during his lecture indicated their enthusiasm to receive his message.\nCitsukhānanda:We went to the TV studio and waited there in the audience until after midnight. The program goes until 1:30, so it was a good time. Twelve-thirty is the peak of the show. The TV interviewer asked Prabhupāda many things. When I translated all of what Śrīla Prabhupāda was explaining, the whole audience became stunned. Prabhupāda told them that the world could be happy if they would just love God and chant His names, Hare Kṛṣṇa. It seemed so simple. Actually everyone was stunned. Even the emcee was just completely stunned by Śrīla Prabhupāda’s answers, by his great sense of intelligence, understanding, and devotion. The emcee’s questions were trivial, about why the devotees shaved their heads and woretilaka,why they dressed as they do, but Prabhupāda’s answers were brilliant.\nThe devotees chanted with Śrīla Prabhupāda during akīrtana,accompanying him with guitars – Mexican style. At the conclusion of the show the interviewer asked, “Can you bless me?”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda exclaimed, “All glories to Mexico City!”\nThe program ended. Citsukhānanda turned to the television announcer. “Thank you very much for giving us this opportunity.” The man made no reply. He was captivated by Śrīla Prabhupāda. He was overwhelmed. Śrīla Prabhupāda left the studio with the devotees, returning to the temple to take rest.\nAt the temple Prabhupāda inspected all the rooms. He told the devotees it was a good building and they should keep it. He liked it. Aware that their standard of service and worship was humble, the devotees were amazed that Prabhupāda seemed so pleased with what they had done. For over a year they had been anxiously waiting for him to visit, and now he had come and they were fully satisfied.\nPrabhupāda had been in Mexico less than twenty-four hours, yet the devotees already had a wealth of incidents – things Śrīla Prabhupāda had said and done in their country – to remember. He found the Mexican people pious. Their humility, simplicity, and devotion was reminiscent of the people of India. “Mexico is very much like India,” he said.\nThat same morning Prabhupāda held a second initiation ceremony. That afternoon at the Sunday festival hundreds of people, as many as could fit, crowded into the hall and onto the second-floor balcony to catch a glimpse of Śrīla Prabhupāda and to hear from him.\nRādhā-Kṛṣṇa:The first day I saw Śrīla Prabhupāda was at the Sunday lecture. I had never seen the temple so crowded. And yet it was completely quiet. There were reporters, students, people interested in different kinds ofyogaand transcendentalism. Śrīla Prabhupāda mainly spoke about the principles ofyoga.He specifically spoke on the sixth chapter of theBhagavad-gītā.Somebody asked him why we discourage people from practicing the popularyogathat everyone practices. In answer, Prabhupāda developed a description of all that Lord Kṛṣṇa says in the sixth chapter about the qualities and requirements to practiceyoga.He told how theyogīshould practice celibacy, go to a sacred place, sit down, and practice the breathing exercises and all the austerities.Yogawas already very popular in Mexico. People had known about it for years. I was practicingyoga,and when I went to see Prabhupāda, I came with a group of people who were also interested inyoga.But when I saw Śrīla Prabhupāda, it was a very incredible experience. I had seen manyyogīs, gurus,and Indian spiritual people. But when I saw Śrīla Prabhupāda it was a completely different experience. Suddenly all the othergurushad no place at all for me. Seeing Prabhupāda was like seeing a personification of all the teachings of theVedas,all the descriptions given in theBhagavad-gītāabout a completelyself-realized person. He was sitting and speaking with his eyes closed in such a serene way, without any tinge of material expression.\n“They are chanting your name,” Citsukhānanda said, and he went out to try and calm the crowd. But finding them overwhelmed with chanting Prabhupāda’s name, he returned to Prabhupāda’s room. “Prabhupāda,” he said, “they want to see you.”\n“Well, let them come,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied.\nThe devotees arranged that everyone could come and see Prabhupāda, one at a time. Through the two doors to his room it was arranged that the people come in a line, enter in one door, and leave from the other to return downstairs. One by one they came through in a great procession. After bowing down with awe and respect for the great saint who had entered among them, they would speak a few words in Spanish.\n“What are they saying?” Prabhupāda asked the devotees.\n“ ‘Give me a blessing, a benediction,’ ” a Mexican devotee replied.\nPrabhupāda, his index finger protruding from his bead bag, began to point to each person as they approached him and say, “Hare Kṛṣṇa.” They were all very happy.\nJune 5Early the next morning Prabhupāda asked Citsukhānanda, “What will we do today?”\n“We’ve arranged a program in a nearby city, Cuernavaca,” said Citsukhānanda. “We have the use of the whole central plaza. They’ve given it for your lecture. They have microphones and a stage and everything, all ready for you to come.”\n“Oh, this is very nice,” Prabhupāda said.\n“Then you’re scheduled to give another lecture at a big hotel in Cuernavaca,” Citsukhānanda continued. “And then we can go to Lakṣmīpriya dāsī’s house, where we can takeprasādam.”\n“Yes, this is very nice. Let us go.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda took a light breakfast and left for Cuernavaca by car. On the way one of the devotees explained to him that Cuernavaca, with its scenic location in the mountains, was a favorite place for writers and artists, including Americans.\nWhen Prabhupāda arrived, several hundred people were gathered in the main plaza of the city. The crowd was varied – tourists taking photographs, farmers, hippies, shoppers, artists, and businessmen. After akīrtanathe devotees introduced Śrīla Prabhupāda, who sat onstage before a large sign bearing themahā-mantra.While a devotee held an umbrella over Prabhupāda’s head to protect him from the blazing noon sun, Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke. “We are not hippies,” he said. “We are happies.” The devotees’ happiness, he said, comes from associating with Kṛṣṇa, the reservoir of happiness, through chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and through eatingprasādam.Many people began nodding their heads in agreement. When he asked everyone to repeat the Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,many did.\nSuddenly Prabhupāda saw Haihaya arriving with newly printed copies ofLa Conciencia de Kṛṣṇa Es el Sistema Mas Elevado de Yoga(Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, the Topmost Yoga System).Haihaya had just gotten the books from the printer that day, and Prabhupāda was very happy to see them. Interrupting his lecture, he said, “Now you can all take one of these books and read them.” The people actually came forward on Prabhupāda’s word and began to take the books. Haihaya had only brought about fifty copies, but Prabhupāda sold all of them. The people took the liberty of asking him for an autographed book, and he signed every one.\nImmediately after the plaza lecture, Śrīla Prabhupāda went to the Casino de la Salva. With no sign of fatigue, Śrīla Prabhupāda lectured on the fundamental philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The audience was particularly interested inhaṭha-yogaand theosophy, and Śrīla Prabhupāda carefully answered their questions, introducing them to the elements of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nPrabhupāda was next supposed to go to Lakṣmīpriya dāsī’s home to takeprasādamand rest. But he decided to return to the Mexico City temple. The devotees drove him back, arriving at about 8:00 P.M. From 8:00 in the morning until 8:00 P.M. he had taken only water. The devotees offered him fruit, but he refused it. He sat in his room, his eyes bright, his face blissful. “This is the way to be happy,” he said “ – work all day for Kṛṣṇa.”\nPrabhupāda asked for a cup of hot milk andpurīswith sugar. Receiving these, he crushed thepurīsinto the sugar and drank the milk. The few devotees sitting with him were enthralled to see Prabhupāda’s transcendental happiness. “This is our life, to serve Kṛṣṇa,” he said. “Work all day for Kṛṣṇa, and take a littleprasādaat night.”\nJune 6Before one hundred students in an auditorium at the National University of Mexico, Prabhupāda described the student’s life as one of struggle. A student has to study diligently to keep from failing, and then after graduation he has to work hard for his food and other necessities. Material life is therefore always a struggle, ending in death. But a human being should ask why he has to endure all these struggles and sufferings and how he can become free of them. The auditorium was quiet, the students listening attentively, as Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke. But when he asked for questions, a Communist yelled out, “Where do you get the money to pay for your food if you’re so renounced? I think you belong to the C.I.A.!” A few other radicals also began calling out challenges. Prabhupāda promptly replied through his translator that because this university did not educate its students in the science of God, it was producing atheists, demons. Further comments from the radical students were overpowered by the audience’s applause. Śrīla Prabhupāda called forkīrtanaandprasādamdistribution, and the formal program ended. Many interested persons approached Śrīla Prabhupāda, asking further questions through Hanumān Goswami, who translated. Others sat takingprasādam.Several hours later Śrīla Prabhupāda left.\nThe university incident typified the response of the Mexican people to Śrīla Prabhupāda. With few exceptions, the people appreciated his work and the purity of his movement. As Prabhupāda had said, the people were simple and pious. Many still lived in villages and were similar to the people of India. Prabhupāda also remarked that the Mexicans wereśūdrasand that they were being saved by Lord Caitanya’s mercy.\nOnly a few devotees had been able to attend the meeting, but upon returning to the temple, one of them told the others, “Prabhupāda had the right answer every time at the very moment he was asked about the philosophy, or about life, or aboutanything! Everyone was impressed.”\nJune 7On Wednesday afternoon Śrīla Prabhupāda left Mexico City and flew to Puerto Vallarta, on the Pacific Coast. Danny, a wealthy race car driver and friend of the Mexico City temple, owned a luxurious villa in the mountains overlooking the ocean. He had invited Śrīla Prabhupāda and several devotees to spend a few peaceful days there before Śrīla Prabhupāda left for Los Angeles.\nA neighbor had cows, and the devotees brought one up to show Prabhupāda. “Why do they take milk from the cow and then kill her?” Prabhupāda asked. “Just like I am giving you something valuable every day, but when I cannot give you any more one day, then you put the knife in my throat. This is not right.”\nAfter a mild rain, the sky cleared. Śrīla Prabhupāda sat outdoors on the terrace until sunset, his disciples seated at his feet, chanting. The atmosphere was calm, and beyond the line of palm trees the devotees could see the sun sinking into the ocean. As darkness came, mosquitoes began to bite.\n“Prabhupāda,” Citsukhānanda asked, “you’re not getting bitten by mosquitoes?”\n“No.”\n“They sure are biting me,” said Citsukhānanda. “Most likely because you’re a pure devotee and I am not pure, that’s why the mosquitoes are biting me.”\n“Maybe,” Prabhupāda said. “Here they are respectful, but in Calcutta, they make no distinction.”\nThe devotees asked Śrīla Prabhupāda questions about preaching. Since so many people they met were practicinghaṭha-yoga,they asked how to change the people’s minds. Prabhupāda said, “Let them do it. Engage them in service also, and they will become purified.”\nAnother devotee asked, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, people are always asking me whether I’ve been to India. They think that if I am teachingyoga,I should have gone to India.”\n“You just tell them that India has come to you,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied.\nThe devotees looked at Prabhupāda with great admiration. Yes, Prabhupāda was India – India personified, sitting before them. But he was more than just India; he was the spiritual world, all they knew of the spiritual world, and he had come for them."

        "content": "April 1973\nŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA WAS staying in Bombay. Besides his own preaching and his translating ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,he was also pursuing the long, drawn-out case to secure the land at Juhu Beach. It was a time in his life that he spent mostly in India, with frequent trips to the West. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was growing rapidly under Śrīla Prabhupāda’s direct supervision, and his visits inspired devotees in ISKCON centers around the world.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had only recently come from Hyderabad. There Śyāmasundara, Prabhupāda’s secretary for over two years, had become involved in a business venture. Several men had persuaded him to buy shares in a ruby mine. Śyāmasundara had begun digging up rough corundum to bring back to the West and sift for the valuable clear rubies. When devotees asked Prabhupāda what he thought of Śyāmasundara’s new business, Prabhupāda replied, “If he wants to do it, let him do it.” Śyāmasundara had rendered him significant service, as his secretary and in helping to pioneer Kṛṣṇa consciousness in England; and Śrīla Prabhupāda, as Kṛṣṇa’s representative, was grateful. But he did not seem much impressed or interested in the mining prospects.\nOn his way to Zurich, Śyāmasundara, carrying about ninety kilos of rough corundum to sell, visited Śrīla Prabhupāda in Bombay. When Śrīla Prabhupāda expressed his desire to rest for a couple of weeks from his traveling and management, Śyāmasundara described a perfect two-week stay for Prabhupāda at St. Moritz, the famous ski resort in southern Switzerland. It was off-season, he said, and tourists would not be there. The clean mountain air would be very healthy and pleasant. He even showed Śrīla Prabhupāda postcards of mountainsides covered with wild flowers. Śrīla Prabhupāda agreed.\nBut when they arrived in Switzerland, it was as cold as winter. Prabhupāda, Śyāmasundara, Śrutakīrti, and Pradyumna took a luxury train up the mountains, curving and circling along the mountain paths, to the resort. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s servant, Śrutakīrti, watched out the window, remarking at the beauty of the snow and mountain peaks. Everything was white. Prabhupāda was silent but finally asked, “What do they call this place?”\nŚrutakīrti replied, “St. Moritz, Śrīla Prabhupāda.”\n“They may call it St. Moritz,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “but I call it St. Hellish.” He then pointed out that the “beautiful” snowscape was lifeless. He did not like seeing “simply branches of trees and snow.” It was only emptiness, without variety. Where were the advertised wild flowers and green hills and beautiful climate? It was as if Śrīla Prabhupāda had somehow been tricked on a pretense to come to a very cold, wintery mountaintop, a place useless for his purposes – St. Hellish.\nPrabhupāda wrote Girirāja in Bombay, tropical Bombay, Juhu Beach, a truly important place that drew Śrīla Prabhupāda’s thoughts and desires.\nImmediately after their arrival, it began to snow, although unusual at this time of year. With ironic disgust, Prabhupāda remarked, “I have come to Switzerland to stay in the snow.” Śrutakīrti could find nodālor rice for Śrīla Prabhupāda. All he could find was farina. Prabhupāda said he would show him how to make a farinacapātībut Śrutakīrti’s attempts were unsatisfactory. There was no question in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mind of staying two weeks at St. Moritz. He would leave as soon as possible. He asked Śyāmasundara to arrange to immediately get them out of St. Hellish.\nŚrutakīrti:One morningPrabhupāda wanted to go on his usual morning walk, but it was snowing out. The room had sliding glass doors, opening from the living room onto a veranda. So Prabhupāda said, “We shall go out for a morning walk? Let us see how cold it is.” He opened up the sliding door, and a big blast of ice-cold air came in. “Ooooh, it is much too cold,” he said. “We can walk in the hallway here.” So myself, Pradyumna, and Prabhupāda went out into the hallway, and Prabhupāda started his morning walk. He would walk back and forth a few hundred feet down this long hallway with just a whole bunch of doors going to the different rooms and an elevator. It was set up electronically so that whenever a door to a person’s apartment would open, the light would go on automatically and stay on for like thirty seconds. After thirty seconds, the lights would go off automatically. Whenever you pushed the elevator button, the lights would go on and the door opened. In this way they were conserving energy. The lights were only on when they were needed. It was expected that you would walk out of your room, the lights would go on, you would walk to the elevator, get in, and then the lights would go off. There was no waste of electricity. So we were walking up and down the hall for our morning walk. It was a half-hour walk. They had these light switches along the wall. We would walk along, and whenever we would come to a button, I would push it. And that would keep the lights on for about thirty seconds. We were walking back and forth, and I was regularly pushing the buttons. Then Pradyumna went inside. It was just Prabhupāda and myself. We were walking along, and I had to keep regularly pushing the button or we would be in darkness. Then Prabhupāda told me he wanted to eat. He was feeling hungry because it was very cold. He said, “You can makehalavāthis morning.” I said, “All right, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Do you want to wait until after your walk, or should I go now?” He said, “No, I will walk. You can go make thehalavā.” I said all right and went inside, but then I realized that the lights were going to be out. So I told everyone inside the room, and we came to the door. We looked outside, and there was Śrīla Prabhupāda walking up and down the hall pushing the light buttons to keep the lights on while he chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa on his beads.\nMeanwhile, Śyāmasundara had invited Balī-mardana from New York to join them. Śyāmasundara had information that the price of gold was rising, and they had planned to invest some of their money in gold. They intended to buy gold one day, sell it the next, and thus make a big profit. Bali-mardana arrived.\nWhen Śrīla Prabhupāda heard that Bhagavān dāsa was preaching in nearby France, Prabhupāda asked to see him. Bhagavān received Prabhupāda’s message by phone, and before coming he had the French devotees prepare a big feast for Prabhupāda. It was evening when Bhagavān arrived, and Prabhupāda was sitting on his bed, preparing to take rest. He smiled broadly to see Bhagavān, and when Bhagavān said, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, I’ve brought a nice feast ofprasādam,” Prabhupāda left his bed to take theprasādam.One by one he tasted all the cooked preparations and then distributed the remnants.\nBut late that same night, after midnight, Śrīla Prabhupāda came out of his room into the room where the devotees were sleeping. With his foot he prodded Bali-mardana and told him to wake up. Prabhupāda said he wanted to see everyone. They all rose and came into Prabhupāda’s room. Everyone could see that he was in a grave mood. He began by reproaching Bali-mardana and Śyāmasundara for risking so much money in gold speculation. The money Bali-mardana had brought was to buy a building for ISKCON New York, and Śyāmasundara’s money was also for purchasing a building, in England. It was not right to risk Kṛṣṇa’s money in this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda said. Śyāmasundara and Bali-mardana both spoke up confidently, trying to convince Śrīla Prabhupāda it was a secure investment. Prabhupāda cut them off. “If you try to speak in this way, then how will I be able to teach you anything?”\nAnd thus Śrīla Prabhupāda stopped the gold scam. Staying up almost all night, Prabhupāda lectured to them in his room. While it was true that anything could be used in the service of Kṛṣṇa, Prabhupāda admonished them that this gold market speculation was actually gambling. It should not be indulged in. Submitting like young boys, his followers agreed to return the money to the proper ISKCON accounts and not to again speculate as if they were high financiers in the international market.\nThe next day snow still fell. It was so cold that Śrīla Prabhupāda could not leave his room. He looked out the window and remarked, “It is a white hell only.” Finally their departure tickets arrived, and Śrīla Prabhupāda left for New York.\nNew YorkApril 5–11, 1973Rādhāvallabha:Seeing that it was such a hellish place, it was always wonderful when Prabhupāda would come to Brooklyn. The neighbors! The Italians hated us, and the Puerto Ricans liked us but wanted to rob us. It was just an abominable, dark, filthy neighborhood, full of hate.\nWhen Prabhupāda would come, the devotees would fill the streets. They would line the steps of the Brooklyn temple, all cheering, with their arms in the air, as Prabhupāda would walk through. He was always pleased to come to Brooklyn, to see all the devotees in that horrible place, to see the press, and to see the new paintings. He always appreciated seeing Rādhā-Govinda, offering his obeisances to Them, leadingkīrtana,and giving lectures in that Brooklyn temple.\nDaivī-śakti:Myself and another big book distributor were invited to go on a morning walk with Prabhupāda. We went to the park. Brahmānanda Swami and Bali-mardana were there. Prabhupāda began the conversation saying, “I had a dream.” So everyone was listening very intently, and Prabhupāda continued. “I dreamed that we had a boat, and there were twenty-five of us on the boat, twelvesannyāsīsand twelvebrahmacārīsand myself. We went all over the world, and in each port we hadsaṅkīrtana.” When Prabhupāda described this ecstatic dream, Bali-mardana and Brahmānanda Swami both began telling Prabhupāda about their boat experiences. They said they were boatmen and would try to help Prabhupāda, and he was pleased to hear it.\nRukmiṇī:One morning while he was walking in New York, Prabhupāda picked a flower from a vine and brought it back to the temple. It was a fragrant white flower. When he picked it and smelled it, he said, “This should be planted all around our Māyāpur complex.” Later I took that flower and found out that the name of it was Silver Lace Vine, or Fleece Vine.\nPañcaratna:I had just gotten videotape equipment, and it was the first time Prabhupāda was videotaped. After we made the tape, we brought it in to show him. It was of a lecture that Prabhupāda gave in the temple. At the end of the lecture he had gotten up and was looking at the Deities during thekīrtana.He was just about to leave when he became more attracted to thekīrtanaand started clapping and dancing. While this was happening, I had been there all the time with the cameras, zooming in and zooming out. Then we showed it to Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he watched it very closely. When thekīrtanapart came on the tape, Prabhupāda again started clapping and chanting. He said it was very nice.\nJāhnavā:Prabhupāda sat on hisāsanain his large reception room beneath the picture of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. Paintings were stacked all around the room to await his evaluation. Present were Jayādvaita, Muralīdhara, Parīkṣit, Jadurāṇī, Puṣkara, a photographer, and myself. Śrīla Prabhupāda was very businesslike and fairly aloof. Later, upon reflection, it seemed to me that this aloofness by Prabhupāda was actually a major step in weening the art department away from his constant supervision and their habit of always asking him questions during his visits and by letters.\nThere was one painting of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who was sitting and looking very sad because He couldn’t find Rādhārāṇī. Prabhupāda asked what the pastime was, but then he objected and said, “Kṛṣṇa doesn’t lament.” The artist, Jadurāṇī, appeared very discouraged to have misrepresented Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda continued discussing the other paintings, but then he turned to Jadurāṇī and remarked, “It’s all right. This painting can be used to show another pastime, when Kṛṣṇa had a headache.”\nAfter Prabhupāda discussed the various paintings, I then showed Prabhupāda some drawings done by thegurukulachildren. One picture was done by Sarasvatī dāsī. On one side of the paper she had drawn a circle to indicate a face, two dots for eyes, a smile, and a peacock feather in the hair. On the reverse side of the paper she drew fine dots. Her explanation was, “If you hold the paper to the light, then you can see Kṛṣṇa appearing in the universe.” When Śrīla Prabhupāda saw this picture and heard her explanation, he became thoughtful, thinking of Sarasvatī. “If Sarasvatī would see someone,” Prabhupāda recalled, “she would ask, ‘Do you know who is Kṛṣṇa?’ Then she herself would answer, ‘He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.’ ” As Prabhupāda said this, he gestured by pointing his finger, indicating the strength of Sarasvatī’s conviction.\nNayanābhirāma:When Prabhupāda came to New York in 1973, we were asked to put on a production of theRāmāyaṇa.We had only one day to put it together. That was why we didn’t use dialogue; we couldn’t memorize the lines on such short notice. We performed for Prabhupāda with gestures, and a dialogue was spoken off the stage. The next morning, right aftermaṅgala-ārati,I was asked to go see Prabhupāda. It was still dark in his quarters, and he was sitting in his back room. He asked me if I was responsible for last night’s production. I didn’t know how to answer, because I didn’t know whether he was going to chastise me or praise me. Then he said it was good, but he had some suggestions for improving it. He said that instead of one voice narrating, we should have a different voice for each character who was to speak. Also, there was a controversy over using a guitar or a sitar as musical accompaniment. Prabhupāda said we shouldn’t play the sitar if we didn’t know how. It was better to play a guitar expertly than a sitar incompetently.\nRādhāvallabha:Prabhupāda was complaining that the books weren’t coming out. Later on, someone came over to the press and said that Prabhupāda had found a spelling mistake. It was a big mistake in the misuse of a single word. So I went and asked Prabhupāda where the mistake was. He said, “I don’t know. I think it was in that chapter there.” So I pulled out all the flats and looked for it. He said, “No, maybe it was that one.” I pulled out more sheets, and he said, “No, I think it was in that torn one.” Then after I had pulled out all the sheets, he said, “Never mind. Justprintit!” At that point I could see that that was Prabhupāda’s attitude toward his books. I could see he wasn’t satisfied that we spent so much time trying to fix all the spelling and composing errors. In this case, he wanted to get the book out, even if it meant later he had to correct the mistake.\nBalavanta:I was in Atlanta, and we had just done political preaching by running for mayor of the city. Prabhupāda called me to come to New York and see him. When I went into his room, he wanted to talk politics. He had different arguments. He said, “So what do they say?”\nI said, “Prabhupāda, they say it is not practical. Our program is not practical.”\nPrabhupāda said, “It is not practical because they will not take to it. Otherwise, it is practical. It is the only solution.” Prabhupāda said the rascals would not take it, and yet if they did, it would solve their problems. He said we have no complicated political program, only one program. Our program is “Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That’s all.” And if the people will meet together regularly and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, they will be successful. I would give Prabhupāda all the arguments I had received, and he would always defeat them.\nKīrtirāja:I had to take Prabhupāda to the Indian consulate to arrange that they grant devotees visas. In the conversation with the consul, Prabhupāda raised his voice loudly and spoke strongly in Bengali. None of us had any idea what was being said except for the few English words throughout the conversation. But we could understand that he was speaking quite forcefully to the man. At the end of the conversation Prabhupāda told me to present the list of devotees going to India and arrange to gather their passports. He said that the consul agreed to grant them one-year visas. We finished the meeting and went out to the car. In the meantime, it had gotten dark and started to rain very hard. As we sat in the car, Prabhupāda said, “I spoke very strongly to him, didn’t I?”\nI agreed, and then Prabhupāda looked at us again and said, “Yes, I can do this, but you cannot.” He said, “I am an old man. They don’t take me seriously. But if you were to speak to someone who was older than you or your age, and if you speak very strongly, they will become offended. But I am an old man, so I can do this. But you cannot.”\nThen as we were driving through the rush hour traffic and the rain, I was nervous because Prabhupāda was in the car. It was difficult to see because the windows were fogging over. I was thinking it was such nasty, horrible weather, when all of a sudden Prabhupāda turned to me and said, “The rain is very pleasing. Without the rain, nothing on the earth could be.” I was shocked, because it was as if he were reading my mind. I had been cursing and condemning the weather, and Prabhupāda turned to me casually and said the rain was nice.\nAs we were driving, Prabhupāda asked us if we had noticed what was written on the plaque as we entered the Indian consulate. Although we had all stopped and glanced at it, we all had to tell Prabhupāda that none of us could remember. Prabhupāda then said that an intelligent man notices all of his surroundings. He even notices how many beams are in the ceiling above his head. He said one time one of his friends asked him, “Do you know how many cars there are in the Punjab Mail Express?” Prabhupāda said he told the man how many cars there were exactly, and that he was right.\nAnother time when Prabhupāda was in New York, he went to see a building on Park Avenue for sale. We were thinking of acquiring it for the New York temple. It was a very big building on the upper side of Park Avenue. We pulled up on the opposite side of the street in front of a small Spanish grocery store. We got out of the car and looked over at the building. The front doors of the building were open, and due to light from the front hall, a golden glow was coming out through the open doors into the evening darkness. Prabhupāda said, “Ah, Śrī Gaurāṅga Hall.” Prabhupāda and Bali-mardana were speaking about the possibility of buying this building, and the next thing I knew, Bali-mardana hit me in the arm and said, “Prabhupāda wants a 7-Up.” I looked at Prabhupāda and said, “Prabhupāda, 7-Up?” Prabhupāda nodded yes. But I repeated, “Prabhupāda, do you really mean 7-Up?” Again he nodded yes. I said, “You mean, it’s lemony with bubbles. Is that what you mean?” Prabhupāda again said, “7-Up.” So I went into the store and bought a can of 7-Up. I went out to the street and gave it to Bali-mardana, who popped open the top and gave it to Prabhupāda, and as we stood there on Park Avenue in ourdhotīs,Prabhupāda held the can up and poured the drink straight into his mouth without touching the can to his lips. When we drove back to the temple, it was the biggest story of the day: Prabhupāda drank 7-Up on Park Avenue!\nRādhāvallabha:We could always tell that Prabhupāda was pleased that we were staying in that horrible place to preach his mission. We could always sense he felt New York was the important place to preach because he had first gone there, and that he was pleased that we were continuing where he had first brought Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the West."

        "chapter_title": "A World Tour",
        "content": "January 1975\nFROM BOMBAY ŚRĪLA Prabhupāda planned a world tour beginning January 25 that would take him to twelve major cities within fifty days, ending back in Bombay. His journey would not only completely orbit the planet eastward but would dip into the Southern Hemisphere, as far south as Venezuela. It would be the eighth time Śrīla Prabhupāda had traveled around the world in his ten years of preaching since going to America from India in 1965. He would enter seven different countries and travel thirty-four thousand miles.\nDue back in India by March for the second international gathering of his disciples at Śrīdhāma Māyāpur, Śrīla Prabhupāda would have to move quickly. Almost one thousand ISKCON devotees from all over the world were planning to be in India for this year’s festival. This year was very special, because after years of work and two prematurely announced openings, Śrīla Prabhupāda would at last hold the grand opening of the ISKCON Krishna-Balaram temple in Vṛndāvana and install the Deities of Gaura-Nitāi, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma, and Rādhā-Śyāmasundara.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had come to Vṛndāvana in September 1974 desiring to open the temple on Kṛṣṇa’s appearance day, but he had been disappointed by delays in construction. At that time Śrīla Prabhupāda became seriously ill in Vṛndāvana. His fever dangerously high, he had given permission to devotees in all the ISKCON temples to hold twenty-four-hourkīrtanato pray for his recovery. He had gradually regained his health, and he was now eating and translating again after several weeks.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wanted to travel before the Māyāpur-Vṛndāvana festival, but he had been delayed in Bombay, waiting for the local government to grant the No Objection Certificate so construction of his temple could begin. When Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Governing Body Commission secretary for South America, Hṛdayānanda Goswami, wrote asking him to please visit South America, he replied,\nBut not until the end of January did the Bombay municipality finally grant the No Objection Certificate; Śrīla Prabhupāda was then free to travel. Prabhupāda had said on different occasions that he traveled to keep his devotees spiritually alive. Although sometimes Śrīla Prabhupāda would say he wanted to stay in one place and write his books, he regularly felt compelled to oversee personally the growth of his Kṛṣṇa consciousness mission on each continent. His time was limited, he felt, and he wanted to strengthen his disciples in their execution of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so they could continue in his absence. He had to travel. But even while traveling, he would continue his translation and commentary of theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamwherever he stopped. Despite his advanced age of eighty years, despite the disruptive travel hours, the jet lag, and the inconveniences of waiting in airports and of customs delays, Prabhupāda was determined to maintain his writing schedule wherever he went.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda’s literary paraphernalia was a dictating machine and reference books. A secretary, Paramahaṁsa Swami, a personal servant, Śrutakīrti, and a Sanskrit student, Nitāi, were Prabhupāda’s traveling entourage. In this way he was prepared to preach and write anywhere and everywhere.\nHis first stop was Hong Kong.\nOnly one disciple, Trivikrama Swami, was stationed in Hong Kong, but just before Śrīla Prabhupāda’s arrival, Pañcadraviḍa Swami arrived from Bangkok to greet Śrīla Prabhupāda. Sudāmā Vipra Swami, who had disassociated himself from ISKCON, also showed up for Prabhupāda’s arrival; these threesannyāsīsgreeted Prabhupāda at the airport.\nTrivikrama Swami had rented a luxury suite at the Hong Kong Hilton for Śrīla Prabhupāda and had arranged a speaking engagement in the Hilton’s convention hall. About two hundred Indians and a few Chinese attended. After speaking forty minutes from the first verse of the seventh chapter ofBhagavad-gītā,Śrīla Prabhupāda concluded, “If you want to get out ofmāyā’sactivities, then you have to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is no other way out. This is a scientific movement. Anyone intelligent, any thoughtful person, he must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise, he is doomed.”\nDuring Śrīla Prabhupāda’s two-day stay the devotees took him to a park in the heart of the city. It was so crowded with people that Śrīla Prabhupāda declared it “hellish.” When they passed people doingtai chiexercises, Trivikrama Swami called such activity useless. “Do not criticize,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. As they walked on, Sudāmā Vipra Swami told Prabhupāda of the floods in Māyāpur. The devotees had lived on the roof of a shack and had had to fight off the snakes seeking shelter there. Śrīla Prabhupāda appreciated, “Yes, you did much service at that time.” Prabhupāda asked of another devotee the difficulties he had faced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Each told of some incident of austerities.\n“What was your most troublesome time in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Śrīla Prabhupāda?” Trivikrama Swami asked. Prabhupāda became silent, then said, “Better you don’t ask.”\nIn the devotees’ small apartment Prabhupāda affirmed that Hong Kong was an important place to preach. Even if only one man remained, they should still develop the center there. “We can print ChineseBhagavad-gītā,” Prabhupāda said. “Someday China will open, and we can go in.”\nPañcadraviḍa Swami had only come to visit Prabhupāda, but Prabhupāda told him, “You shall become our new manager for the Hong Kong center.” When Prabhupāda said this, the other devotees responded, “Jaya!Jaya!” But Pañcadraviḍa Mahārāja felt bewildered.I have to stay in Hong Kong?he thought. But then he remembered the letter Prabhupāda had just written him. Prabhupāda had stated that a devotee must be like a reaping machine –  the Bengali saying is that a reaping machine will reap wheat in heaven or hell. So the devotee must serve Kṛṣṇa in heaven or hell. Pañcadraviḍa had considered returning to India, but now Prabhupāda said, “It is not very important if you go back to India. The only thing that is important is to continue service.” The important thing was to distribute books in Hong Kong, Prabhupāda told him; it doesn’t matter whether people came to the programs. Somehow he should publish books in the Chinese language and distribute them. In this way the work would go on.\nTokyoJanuary 27–28Suspicious Japanese immigration officials delayed Śrīla Prabhupāda and considered not giving him a visa. Granting no more than a two-day transit visa, they finally allowed him to enter. After such a poor reception, Prabhupāda was royally greeted by Dai Nippon Printers of Tokyo. Their white-gloved, uniformed chauffeur picked up Śrīla Prabhupāda at the airport in a Mercedes and drove him to the ISKCON center. Even though Śrīla Prabhupāda’s BBT was printing with American printers by 1975, Dai Nippon was still competitively bidding for their work. The BBT was an important contract for any printer to gain, and Śrīla Prabhupāda was the BBT’s sole author and publishing director.\nA seasoned traveler familiar with the sights and sounds of almost every continent, Śrīla Prabhupāda was accustomed to these short stops in the Orient. When in India, he could tell his Godbrothers and friends about lands and peoples they had only read of in books. Yet, wherever Śrīla Prabhupāda went, he remained fixed in transcendental consciousness. His lectures on theBhagavad-gītāin Tokyo were the same as in Hong Kong or in America; the message – “Surrender to Kṛṣṇa” – was universally and urgently applicable in every town and village. But sometimes Śrīla Prabhupāda would spice his talks with local references.\n“Everyone is suffering, that’s a fact,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said during a class in the small Tokyo ISKCON temple. He was describing the inherent miseries in material life. “Just like now,” Prabhupāda said, “two big directors of Dai Nippon Company came to see me. We have got business with them, so they are meeting so many problems for their printing work. They are maintaining about two hundred thousand people to carry on their business. They have a huge establishment, huge responsibility. But there are problems also. So this material world is full of problems. One who understands this is calledsura,or a civilized man.”\nCiting the alternative miseries of heat and cold, Prabhupāda referred to Tokyo’s cold climate, which was so severe that it prevented him from taking his morning walks. “This winter season comes, and we do not want chilly cold; therefore we are covering our body,” Prabhupāda said. “The cause of our covering is that we are suffering. But after covering, if we feel some pleasure, what is this pleasure? It is only for the time being some arrangement that we stop suffering. This is the nature of material enjoyment.” Japanese students were attending Prabhupāda’s classes, and Prabhupāda addressed them directly. “When we are in danger in Japan,” Prabhupāda said, “ – you have got many times the experience of earthquake, do you not? So what do you do at that time? Hmm? You all Japanese boys and girls, what do you do? Have you experienced earthquake? You have? What do you do at that time?”\nPrabhupāda paused in his talk, inviting the Japanese boys and girls to speak out and tell him something, but they sat still, looking at him silently. “When there is earthquake,” Prabhupāda continued, “what do you do? Hmm? But I have seen in America, they all, everyone, they scream.”\nPrabhupāda’s audience broke into laughter.\n“And perhaps they remember about God,” Prabhupāda said. “Naturally they will remember, ‘God save us.’ That means that we do not wish to die, that’s a fact. You cannot say that death is a very good thing; no one will say. But we have to die. But you don’t want death. This is suffering. And not only in death but even in lifetime. Just like we are an old man. Who wants to become an old man? Everyone wants to remain youthful. This is undesirable. This is suffering. Actually we are suffering because we are an old man. We are suffering so many diseases, so many inconveniences. If I am not helped by three or four men, then I cannot move even. So this is suffering.\n“Just like now in Tokyo City,” Prabhupāda continued, “you are making very big, big buildings everywhere, all over the world, to live very comfortably. But that comfortable life is also not assured, because you will have to die. Therefore it is calledaśāśvatam,‘not permanent.’ This is to be understood first. Those who are intelligent, they are very pessimistic. And one who is satisfied with this temporary so-called happiness, he is calledasura.“By the grace of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, theasuraswere becomingsuras,Prabhupāda concluded. For this he was traveling – “To give them education to understand what is Absolute Truth.” Only if one took to Kṛṣṇa consciousness could he becomesura,the perfect man, and make his life successful.\nPrabhupāda gave two lectures in Japan. In his second talk he argued that because there is design in nature, there must be a designer. His logic and his examples were precise and vigorous. He referred to local governmental organization within a city and how it is controlled by persons. “Similarly, when I see that the cosmic order is working so nicely and systematically and reasonably, how can I say there is no controller? How can you say logic? Tell me anyone. Can you say, anyone? How can you say there is no controller?Jagad āhur anīśvaram.What is their logic? You tell me.” Prabhupāda wanted a challenge from his audience, so he pointed to his secretary. “You are sometimes on their side. What is their logic?”\nParamahaṁsa: “Well, no controller is ever seen.”\nPrabhupāda: “But you have not seen who is the Japanese government’s president. How can you conclude there is no government? You have not seen the president or the supreme head. But how can you say there is no government? Otherwise, how is it going on so nicely? You may not see so many things, but that does not mean anything. That is not good logic, that ‘I have not seen.’ ” Someone in the audience put forward the theory of chance, and Prabhupāda responded with great enthusiasm to defeat the nonsense theory.\n“Kṛṣṇa is not alone,” Prabhupāda said. “ ‘Kṛṣṇa’ means that He has got many energies. Just like a tiny person like me, Bhaktivedanta Swami. I have this movement, and I am not alone. I have got so many assistants all over the world. I was the originator, I was the founder, so I am not alone. Similarly, as I have expanded with my disciples in so many ways, in so many places, I can expand. I am a common man. But how can Kṛṣṇa expand? We can just imagine. He is the Supreme Lord.Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam.He can expand Himself. But He is the only person. He is doing everything. Just like I am replying to dozens of letters from all over the world and trying to manage. Similarly He is also maintaining alone,ananta-rūpam,by unlimited assistants.Parasya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.You have to understand like that.”\nAmong the “dozens of letters” and the worldwide managerial problems Prabhupāda referred to, a particularly disturbing bit of news arrived during his two-day visit in Japan. The police in Germany had raided the ISKCON temple in Frankfurt and confiscated money from the bank accounts. They had trumped up charges of solicitation fraud, and a mass propaganda war was mounting against Kṛṣṇa consciousness through inimical German media. When Prabhupāda received a distressed letter from his leader in Germany, Haṁsadūta, he asked that Haṁsadūta come and meet him in Hawaii.\nNow while in Japan Prabhupāda received a telegram from Bhagavān dāsa, the G.B.C. for southern Europe, who would temporarily manage affairs in Germany. Prabhupāda replied, “Try to manage Germany, London, and Paris. The main business in Germany is to reply to the charges and rescue the frozen money. In England, we have to revive the Ratha-yātrā festival, which has now stopped by the police intrigue. In Paris, you require a larger place to accommodate devotees, so find out a suitable place.” In this way, even while traveling rapidly, staying only a day or two in faraway places, Prabhupāda received and replied to messages regarding the urgent affairs of his worldwide movement. These affairs were always on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mind in one way or another. He alone was the ultimate judge of the affairs of ISKCON, and he knew best ISKCON’s inner workings. As he had said in his class, he was assisted by many expansions, and yet he was still the single supreme person in ISKCON. In this casesupremenot only meant the most exalted and worshipable personality, but the person who had to take the most anxiety and whose deliberations were the most demanding. This also confirmed the need for Prabhupāda’s traveling. By traveling and inspiring the leaders in each city and country, he could avoid disasters and irregularities and keep his armies strong on all fronts against the invasions ofmāyā,which were liable to occur, and which were occurring from day to day.\nHawaiiJanuary 29–February 9Śrutakīrti:On the Pan Am Airlines from Tokyo to Hawaii Prabhupāda was reading something about women’s liberation. He said, “If these women want to be liberated, then tell them to shave their heads like us and they can be liberated.” Prabhupāda asked Nitāi dāsa to call one of the stewardesses over and tell her, “If you want to be like a man, then shave your head.”\n“Go ahead,” Prabhupāda nudged Nitāi. “Cut a joke. Call her over here. Tell her.” Nitāi hesitated, but Prabhupāda seemed serious. “Tell her to shave her head. Then she can be a man if she wants to be liberated.” Although Prabhupāda repeatedly asked that he call the stewardess and make the joke, Nitāi wouldn’t do it. So Prabhupāda finally let it go.\nAfter Prabhupāda arrived in Hawaii some of the persons involved in the controversy brought their philosophical issues before him. He once again clarified his position and the position of his true followers.\nWhile walking one morning with devotees on Waikiki Beach, Prabhupāda answered their questions about the nature of pure devotional service.\nDevotee: “I’ve heard there is a philosophy here among some of the devotees that if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa you can go back to the spiritual world, even if you do not give up your independence.”\nPrabhupāda: “So what is your philosophy?”\nDevotee: “Well, it seems that’s somewhat hypocritical. Because chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa means that you are praying to Kṛṣṇa to please be engaged eternally in His service and to become completely dependent on Him. So we try to explain like that. We try to follow all the teachings and instructions, attendmaṅgala-ārati,and morning and evening class.”\nPrabhupāda: “So they are doing that or not?”\nDevotee: “No, they’re not even following regulative principles.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then?”\nDevotee: “They think that just by chanting they will go back to the spiritual world. That is enough.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then what is the meaning of the ten kinds of offenses? If he is chanting without offense, then it is all right. But if he is committing offenses, then it will not be effective. There are ten kinds of offenses; whether he is strictly offenseless, then he is all right. If he is offender, then it will not be fruitful. Or it will be fruitful, but it will take a long time. Because first of all you must become offenseless. So if they are committing offenses, how can they be perfect? He is committing the offense of not following the rules and regulations. That means he is thinking that ‘Whatever I can do will be adjusted by chanting the name.’ Is it not?”\nDevotee: “Yes, that’s one of the offenses.”\nPrabhupāda: “That is called the greatest offense.Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.‘Ican go on committing sinful activity, but by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇamantrait will be adjusted.’ That is the greatest offense. So explain it to them.”\nThe devotees then asked if such chanting without following the regulative principles strictly was just a waste of time. It was not a useless thing, Prabhupāda replied, but it was a very slow process. He compared it to kindling a fire and at the same time pouring water on it.\nAnother devotee protested that all devotees living outside the temple weren’t breaking the regulative principles. He knew many who were following. Prabhupāda replied, “It doesn’t matter that you have to live in the temple. Not that everyone has to live in the temple. If he does not agree with his other Godbrothers, friends, he can live separately. But he must follow the rules and regulations. That is wanted. But if you live with the devotees, it will automatically be done.”\nDevotee: “Yes, then it is easy.”\nPrabhupāda: “Therefore it is recommended that you live with devotees. But if you cannot agree with the devotees, you have got your own opinion, then you still can’t make a new opinion as far as following the process is concerned. It is not a good idea to say, ‘Whatever I do, that is my independence, and I will chant.’ ” Prabhupāda admitted that even if one was living in the temple but his mind was not absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he also could not advance quickly. But the great advantage of living in the temple could not be denied.\nPrabhupāda: “It is just like even in ordinary business. If you transact business in the stock association, you get good business. And outside the stock association you don’t get good. Because the association is there. There are many purchasers and many sellers. So if you have to sell, you get an immediate purchaser. And if you have to purchase, there is an immediate seller. Therefore the stock exchange is there. So if we live together in the stock exchange of devotional service, then you can help me and I can help you, so our business will go on nicely. And outside the market you can live three hundred miles away from the stock exchange, but you will not get so many business opportunities.”\nDevotee: “You’ll miss the opportunities.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. Therefore, if you want to do business, you must take the first opportunity, the greatest opportunity. That is intelligence. And if we think, ‘All right, I shall do it slowly, and in seven hundred lifetimes I shall become perfect,’ that is another thing.”\nDevotee: “It is riskier to stay outside.”\nPrabhupāda: “Oh, yes. Otherwise, why are you opening so many centers and making arrangements that we shall provide you with shelter, with food – ‘These are the facilities, you live here. Do whatever is your capacity in the temple. Don’t sleep but work.’ That is our teaching.Satāṁ prasaṅgāt.And Rūpa Gosvāmī also says,sato vṛtteḥ, sādhu-saṅgāt, bhaktiḥ prasidhyati.If you live with the association of the devotees, then it will be quickly fruitful. And if you live with these ordinary men, then whatever you’ve got will be finished very soon. In another verse it is said that it is preferred to live within a cage surrounded by fire than to live with the nondevotee.” The essential thing was to follow the order of the spiritual master, Prabhupāda stated, whether in or out of the temple. He recalled that he also did not live within the temple, but still he always strictly followed his spiritual master’s order. “Wherever you live,” Prabhupāda said, “if you follow strictly the instruction of theguru,then you remain perfect. But if we create concocted ideas against the instruction of theguru,then we go to hell.Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo yasya prasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi.There is no more shelter; finished. If theguruthinks, ‘This person, I wanted to take him back to home, back to Godhead, but now he is going against me, he is not following’ –aprasāda– then when he is displeased, everything is finished.”\nOne of the devotees asked further how one can serve the spiritual master while working at an outside job. “Say I have some outside job, I’m living outside, but I’m not giving fifty percent of my income. So then that job I’m doing, is it actually under the authority of theguru?”\nPrabhupāda: “Then you are not following the instruction ofguru.That is plain fact.”\nDevotee: “So that means the whole activity during the day – working – that means that I’m not following the instruction of theguru? It’s unauthorized activity?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, if you don’t follow the instruction of theguruthen you have fallen down immediately.”\nAnother confrontation took place in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, with devotees who insisted they could faithfully obey Śrīla Prabhupāda but could not follow his G.B.C. representative or his ISKCON. One dissenter had devised an intricate philosophy that Śrīla Prabhupāda was all-knowing and expert spiritually, but not materially. “Prabhupāda can’t build a jet engine,” he said. “He can’t build a nuclear reactor. Therefore he is not expert materially. But he is expert spiritually.”\nMost of the devotees rejected this concoction. According tośāstra,the pure devotee, unlike theyogī,completely depends on Kṛṣṇa for his ability. Theyogītries to develop powers to do wonderful things like walking on water or becoming invisible, but a devotee’s powers come through his surrender to Kṛṣṇa, who creates his devotee’s expertise.\nAccording to this new theory, since Prabhupāda had to depend on his own men, his disciples, to know what was going on in ISKCON, he was unaware of how badly the G.B.C. were mismanaging, of how they were misconducting the book distribution, and of how they were mistreating the devotees. Prabhupāda was not aware, because these activities were occurring on the material platform. In this way, they reached their conclusion of faith and trust in Prabhupāda but refused to work within his society with his representatives.\nThe devotees in Prabhupāda’s room had formerly been leaders of ISKCON Hawaii but had left and were now threatening to use the funds and properties in their own name. Prabhupāda kept asking them simply, “Why did you leave? Why don’t you stay? Why don’t you surrender?” But they insisted that while they trusted Prabhupāda, they could not trust the G.B.C.\nOne of the G.B.C. members in the room became exasperated with their refusal to accept Prabhupāda’s simple request of surrender. “You say that you accept Prabhupāda?”\n“Yes,” they replied.\n“And you say you have faith in him?”\n“Yes.”\n“You say that whatever he asks, you can follow?”\n“Yes.”\n“So, then, if Prabhupāda asks you to follow the G.B.C., will you do it?” The room became tense and silent.\n“No, we cannot follow.”\nWhen they uttered that no, Śrīla Prabhupāda dropped his fist on his table and pointed to the deviant devotees, declaring, “Just see the hypocrisy!”\nEven after Prabhupāda’s stark conclusion, they maintained their “we-surrender-to-you-but-not-to-lSKCON” philosophy until Prabhupāda asked them to leave. To the other devotees remaining in the room Prabhupāda remarked, “When they say they don’t like ISKCON and the G.B.C., they are really saying they don’t like to follow my order. That means they don’t like my order. That means they don’t have faith in my order. That means they don’t have faith in me. That meansguru-aparādha.To say they have faith in me is just hypocrisy.”\nŚrutakīrti:Finally Prabhupāda was ready to leave. Just before he was ready to go, he said he wanted to see me. He said, “Śrutakīrti, so now you are going to stay here? Your wife is here and child?” I said, “Yes, Prabhupāda.” He said, “Yes, so stay here as householder and manage the temple.” But all along I was thinking I really should go with Prabhupāda. He had no one with him. He had no servant or anything. But I said, “Yes, Prabhupāda, I think I should stay.” And he replied, “So that is good. Yes, you stay here with your wife.” But one of thesannyāsīsin the room started laughing and said, “Yes, you know what they call the wife and child? They are known as the tigress and jackal.” Then thesannyāsīasked Śrīla Prabhupāda, “Prabhupāda, I know why the woman is called a tigress, but why are the children considered jackals?” Prabhupāda replied, “Well, the children, in so many ways they create so many inconveniences for the father. They are always requiring things, and sometimes disturbing him, and he cannot sleep. In this way, it is like eating the flesh of the father. This is the business of jackals, eating flesh. So the children are like jackals. They are always putting the father in so much disturbance and difficulty.” So I was sitting there, thinking, “Gee, here I am, and Prabhupāda is telling me to stay with the tiger and jackal.” So then I said, “Prabhupāda, I think I should come with you.” And Prabhupāda simply said, “All right.”\nLos AngelesFebruary 9–10, 1975Hṛdayānanda Goswami:When we would get in the car to go on the morning walk, Śrīla Prabhupāda would always smell like sandalwood, and there would also be the aroma of flowers, because he would always wear flower garlands. Prabhupāda was always very clean, with freshtilaka,so immediately when he would sit in the car, the car would become spiritualized and sanctified. All illusion would be gone. And many times, as we would pull away from the curb, Prabhupāda would look out the window, and he would see the particular Los Angeles neighborhood we were in and would often recite this verse,harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam.He would recite it with great feeling, almost like a mother seeing her child in a dangerous or diseased situation. With great intensity Prabhupāda would recite this, urging them all to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nISKCON Los Angeles, New Dvārakā, the Western world headquarters, was burgeoning with many Kṛṣṇa conscious projects. Book distribution was booming. The devotee population was growing. Money was available and was utilized in various technological and cultural preaching departments. Śrīla Prabhupāda visited for the first time the spacious BBT warehouse, where his books were stored and shipped out to the ISKCON centers around the world.\nA trail of devotees in several cars followed Prabhupāda’s car as he pulled up in front of the large warehouse. He entered the front reception office. On the wall were framed color reproductions of the covers ofBack to Godheadmagazine in consecutive issues. Śrīla Prabhupāda stopped before a large framed painting of Sītā-devī, the wife of Advaita Ācārya, as she came to pay respects to the newborn baby Nimāi, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Prabhupāda asked who had painted it and, when told the name of one of his disciples, remarked, “She has good talent.”\nRāmeśvara, the manager of the BBT, was acting as Prabhupāda’s tour guide through the warehouse.\n“We have two warehouses,” Rāmeśvara said, and he led Śrīla Prabhupāda onto the floor of a vast storage room with its ceiling three stories high. Everywhere stood stacks and stacks of books in cartons.\n“So are they going out or simply stacking there?” Śrīla Prabhupāda asked.\nRāmeśvara: “They’ve been greatly reduced since they first arrived.”\nWearing his swami cap pushed jauntily back on his head and walking regally with his cane, Śrīla Prabhupāda surveyed the warehouse with pleasure.\n“So, Haṁsadūta,” he said, turning, “you have to make agodāmlike this.” Haṁsadūta smiled and agreed. “Then you will defeat these charges,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda. “When the German nation will accept these books, then that will be the proper reply to the charges.”\n“This forklift lifts the pallets high up to the ceiling,” Rāmeśvara pointed out. Prabhupāda asked for a demonstration, and the driver hurried to start up the engine. Meanwhile, Rāmeśvara pointed out special racks holding five hundred copies of each of Prabhupāda’s books for the library party, which was traveling and selling full sets to university libraries across the country.\nAs the forklift began moving, Prabhupāda remarked, “I first saw this machine in the Commonwealth Pier, Boston.” The boy driving the truck became so nervous before Prabhupāda that he could not operate it properly. “Usually he is very careful,” Rāmeśvara apologized.\nRāmeśvara explained that the rent was eighteen hundred dollars a month, a good price for that area. He told Prabhupāda that a speaker system played Prabhupāda’s lectures in the warehouse throughout the day. Prabhupāda remarked, “Acchā,”and chuckled with pleasure. They then entered the second warehouse, which storedBack to Godheadmagazines. Prabhupāda asked about the arrangement for fire, and the devotees told him they had fire insurance and fire alarms. He saw where theBhagavad-gītāswere stored as well asŚrīmad-BhāgavatamandCaitanya-caritāmṛtavolumes. Some of them had just arrived from the printer.\nWhile walking in the warehouse Prabhupāda mentioned the dramatization some of the devotees had performed for him the previous evening. “Now we have gotCaitanya-caritāmṛtaandBhāgavatam.If such demonstrations are done very nicely, it will be very much appreciated, even by the public. We can collect some money.” Standing in the midst of the bound volumes, Prabhupāda elaborated on the theatrical possibilities of their dramatization. The devotees could act in pantomime, he said, and sound tracks could narrate plays in many different languages. In this way they could tour India and specifically attend the upcoming Māyāpur and Vṛndāvana festivals. Theatrical talents,alltalents, were acquired from austerity and should be used to glorify Kṛṣṇa.\n“Kṛṣṇa isUttamaśloka,” Prabhupāda said, as the devotees crowded around in between the aisles of stacked books. “So we have got so many of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes, Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s pastimes. We can overflood. Just like you can overflood with this literature, we can overflood. This is art. Art, music, everything we can utilize – in any way one is addicted. Let him eat only, let him sing only, let him paint only, let him dance only. We have got everything. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Let him do business only. Yes, engineering, construct temples. It is an all-perfect movement. That is Kṛṣṇa. All-attractive. Everyone can become attracted and give up everything. He will be attracted by Kṛṣṇa in such a way that he will give up all nonsense. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. All other attraction finished.Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam.Simply Kṛṣṇa.” Prabhupāda walked on until he faced an especially large area of tall stacked cartons. “What are these?” he asked.\n“Back to Godheadmagazines,” said Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja.\nRāmeśvara: “These boxes have come from the printer all ready to go to different countries, and they stamp the address on it. These are those newspapers you saw yesterday calledSpiritual Revolution.”\nPrabhupāda: “I think thisRevolutionisnot very important. Make revolution with magazine, thisBack to Godhead.And what are these?”\nRāmeśvara pointed out theCaitanya-caritāmṛtas.One after another, Prabhupāda examined the stacks and then the individual books on racks. Sometimes he handled them, leafing through their pages, and sometimes he touched the cartons with his cane.\n“Just before Christmas,” Rāmeśvara exclaimed with exuberance, “this wall was filled up, and now it is practically empty. We have sold so many books just in a few months. All up to the ceiling it was filled. Now we have to reprint.”\nPrabhupāda: “Now this is only the English language. In every language we should have such a biggodām.”Turning to Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, he said, “You have taken Spanish.” And turning to Haṁsadūta, he said, “And you in German. Let them overflood. No other literature.” Devotees surrounding Prabhupāda burst out in triumphant laughter. Prabhupāda then quoted a Bengali phrase, “They’ll say, ‘No, no, we don’t want any other literature.’ ”\nIn the presence of his books Prabhupāda was exhilarated, and the thought of how more and more books could be written, printed, and distributed in many different languages made him ecstatic. Although the present warehouse in L.A. was awesomely large, Prabhupāda envisioned beyond it to other countries and other warehouses.\n“I think no religious publisher has seen such biggodāmin their life. Hmm?” Prabhupāda widened his eyes and looked at the others. “Throughout the whole world,” he continued, “as soon as they will hear about religious books, they immediately avoid it. Especially the Communist country. Bring some Communist country man. Show him that ‘You are trying to avoid God. Now see how we are preaching God.’ ”\nPrabhupāda was next shown to the office of Kīrtirāja dāsa, who was in charge of sending out the orders received from the college libraries around the country. Kīrtirāja showed Prabhupāda how a well-known Christian magazine had recently reduced the quality of its printing from an expensive color magazine to a plain paper edition. “They have degraded,” Prabhupāda remarked.\n“Now we have almost 125 standing orders forŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,” said Kīrtirāja, “and 100 forCaitanya-caritāmṛta.”\n“That’s nice,” Prabhupāda replied. The devotees then showed him the Golden Avatar studios, where tapes of his lectures were kept as masters and duplicated by high-speed equipment. “This is a complete library of all your lectures,” Rāmeśvara explained. “We keep it carefully because we know it is very important. They are cataloging it according to the title of the book, so if someone wants to see what Your Divine Grace has lectured on theBhagavad-gītā,they can find it, or fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,First Canto, or whatever. They have an index system.” Prabhupāda approved: “Very good.” Rāmeśvara introduced the technician for duplicating the tapes and pointed out the extensive equipment. “This makes four copies of the cassette every three minutes,” Rāmeśvara continued, “so we are mass-producing your lectures.”\nPrabhupāda: “Less than a minute for one copy.”\nRāmeśvara described how devotees were buying Prabhupāda’s tapes on a subscription rate of three a week, and orders were coming in from all over the world.\n“American organization,” Prabhupāda proudly said.\nHe next met Svarūpa dāsa, the corresponding secretary. Rāmeśvara explained how he answered all letters regarding Prabhupāda’s books and encouraged the people to become life members.\n“I was also doing that,” Prabhupāda reminisced, “when I was Dr. Bose’s manager. Any inquiry coming from the outside, I must continue correspondence with him until he becomes a customer. That I was doing.”\nPrabhupāda saw one office after another until he had completely toured all the warehouse facilities. “Nice, well-equippedgodām,”he remarked. And they then left the building, walking through a light rain to their waiting car. Rāmeśvara pointed to Prabhupāda’s name printed on the building.\nPrabhupāda looked up. “Yes, that’s nice. They will be inquisitive, ‘What is that book?’ ”\nRiding back to the temple in the car, Prabhupāda reflected, “I have said that there is no happiness in this material world, and that’s a fact. But if there is a little happiness, that is in America. So you are favored by Kṛṣṇa. Utilize this favor of Kṛṣṇa in glorifying Kṛṣṇa. Then it is successful.Avicyuto ’rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito yad-uttamaśloka.To become extraordinary in any branch of facilities requires austerities. So when one has acquired that, he should engage it for glorifying the Supreme.Yad uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda replied that he had originally plannedKṛṣṇabook in two volumes; he didn’t want to change it. Rāmeśvara presented the economic arguments. Because of an oil embargo, the printing industry had suffered badly; prices had gone up fifty percent. The BBT already had a contract with Dai Nippon to reprint the book. They had already bought the paper, so they were obliged to go ahead. Yet Dai Nippon had just raised their prices and would not honor their original contracts. After discussing the various economic difficulties for over an hour, Śrīla Prabhupāda unhappily consented to reprint the hardboundKṛṣṇabook in three volumes.\nRāmeśvara then mentioned that Dai Nippon had said the book would be much cheaper if the BBT printed it the same size as theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,instead of the larger size. When Prabhupāda heard that, he banged his fist on the desk. He had planned it in that size. Nothing would change it. He would hear no more of it. He then told Rāmeśvara to leave the room.\nStaggering down the stairs, Rāmeśvara realized that he had just been thrown out of the room by his spiritual master. But he also felt ecstatic in appreciation of Śrīla Prabhupāda. For the first time, he began to appreciate how meticulously Śrīla Prabhupāda planned every detail of his books. Not only did Prabhupāda carefully prepare the translations and purports, but he also considered the market, the cover pictures. Everything about the book Prabhupāda had considered deeply. As a humble servant, Rāmeśvara was surprised and awestruck as he began to understand how deeply Prabhupāda was involved in all decisions regarding his books.\nRāmeśvara:One time I was up in Prabhupāda’s room, and we were talking again about BBT printing. It was an involved conversation, but suddenly, right in the middle of it, Prabhupāda’sprasādamarrived, placed by his servant on a little table Prabhupāda ate from in his bedroom. As soon as theprasādamarrived, Prabhupāda rose from his seat, moved to that room, sat down, and became totally immersed, almost like in a trance of honoring Kṛṣṇa’sprasādam.It was so transcendental, it was as if I suddenly ceased to exist. Prabhupāda did not say even a word. It was just theprasādam,and Prabhupāda became absorbed in Kṛṣṇa. So I very quietly offered my obeisances and hurriedly left the room.\nPrabhupāda entered the artists’ studio, followed as usual by as many people as could fit into the room. He stood before the diorama. The models were exquisite, the figures as realistic in detail as figures in the best wax museum, and they were dressed and bejeweled like temple deities. The horses and chariots were startlingly lifelike. The scene was that depicted on the cover of Śrīla Prabhupāda’sBhagavad-gītāAs It Is. Prabhupāda’s response was spontaneous delight. His face broke into an ecstatic smile.\n“The horses are more beautiful than Kṛṣṇa,” Prabhupāda commented. There was a groan from the devotees. “That is because they are the servants of Kṛṣṇa,” he said, smiling.\nLater Śrīla Prabhupāda instructed the Los Angeles leaders to give the doll-makers full financial support. His spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, had been very keen to create such doll exhibits on the teachings of theBhagavad-gītāandŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and that was how Śrīla Prabhupāda had received the idea. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī had also been willing to spend big sums of money to put a large collection of dolls on exhibit in Calcutta. In collecting for this project, he had introduced a system of keeping his temples in debt. He would get his disciples to collect for a specific project, but when they gave him the money, he would spend it on dioramas. Then he would again return to those same disciples and request money for the same project they had already collected for.\n“But we gave it to you, Guru Mahārāja.”\n“No,” Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī would reply. “That which you gave me has already been spent on dioramas. Now I need it for the original purpose.” He had been convinced that these artistic exhibits could attract and convert people in the West, and so Śrīla Prabhupāda was intent to open diorama museums and exhibits all over the world.\n“Kṛṣṇa has given me hundreds of nice places of residence,” Śrīla Prabhupāda laughed. “But His order is you cannot stay.” Prabhupāda was explaining his transcendental predicament to a few disciples gathered in his room on the last day of his visit in Los Angeles. “I’ll tell you one humorous story in this connection which is a little long,” Prabhupāda said, and he appeared to hesitate. “I don’t wish to divert your attention, but it is an interesting story. That is also mentioned in theBhāgavatam, aniketana:one may have many nice places to live, still he should think, ‘I have no place to live.’ That is one of the spiritual items.”\n“What is that story?” Haṁsadūta asked, and the other devotees laughed. They were eager to hear the story and didn’t want Prabhupāda to avoid it.\nPrabhupāda smiled. “The story is,” he said, “that there was a joker. His name was Gopāla Ban. He was the joker of a king, Rāja Kṛṣṇa. You know that place, Krishnanagar, near Māyāpur? He was the king of that place. So the kings used to keep a joker to please them by words. So this joker, Gopāla Ban, was constructing a new building for himself. It was almost finished, but there was as yet no opening ceremony. So the Rāja advised one of his friends, ‘If you can go and pass stool in that new house of Gopāla’s, then I will give you so much prize. Go and pass stool there.’ ” Prabhupāda chuckled. “So the man said, ‘Yes, I’ll do it.’ So one day the man made his plan. As he was passing the new house, all of a sudden he entered.\n“ ‘Gopāla, I am very much called by nature. Kindly show me where I can pass stool.’ Gopāla was intelligent, and he could understand there was some trick.\n“ ‘Yes, yes,’ Gopāla said, ‘there is the lavatory. Come here. You can use it.’ But then he made so many conditions. ‘The door must be opened so you may pass stool, but I will see that you are passing stool.’\n“ ‘How is that possible?’ the man asked. ‘Can I use it or not?’\n“ ‘No, it is possible,’ Gopāla said. ‘You can pass stool here,butyou cannot pass urine. If you pass urine, then I shall kill you.’ So, passing stool,” Prabhupāda commented, “without passing urine, how is it possible? ‘You have come to pass stool,’ Gopāla said, ‘and I will allow you. That you can do here. But don’t pass a drop of urine.’ ” Prabhupāda laughed heartily and said, “So that is my position. Kṛṣṇa says, ‘You may have hundreds of centers and places, but you cannot live anywhere.’ That is Kṛṣṇa’s order. It is a plan not to become attached.”\nDevotee: “Just like Nārada Muni got that curse from Lord Brahmā.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, not Lord Brahmā but Dakṣa Rāja – he cursed Nārada Muni that he cannot stay anywhere more than three minutes. Nārada Muni’s business is preaching, so every one of us, we have to become disciples of Nārada Muni.”\nAnd thus Śrīla Prabhupāda, the greatest living disciple of Nārada Muni, made plans to travel next to Mexico and then to Venezuela on his world tour for preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. His disciple in charge of South America, Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, had joined Prabhupāda in Hawaii and come with him to Los Angeles to ensure Prabhupāda’s keeping his promise to visit South America. So Prabhupāda’s promise was firm. As he said, Lord Kṛṣṇa had arranged it that he should go constantly from place to place. And wherever he went, Prabhupāda tended expertly the delicate creepers of devotional service growing in the hearts of his disciples. He also stoked the fires of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and fanned them into blazes. And in each place he left behind more dedicated followers than before. He gave further orders to be executed, and he redefined and clarified directions for guiding and expanding his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.\nFebruary 1975Śrīla Prabhupāda returned to Mexico in February of 1975. During the three years that had passed since his first visit, more centers had opened in the Caribbean and South America. In Trinidad, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, American disciples had worked with local devotees to establish centers. Also in Caracas and Buenos Aires many people had contacted Prabhupāda’s disciples and began chanting and reading his books. In 1974, Śrīla Prabhupāda appointed Hṛdayānanda Goswami the Governing Body Commissioner for all of Latin America, and from that point the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in Latin America began rapidly expanding. Prabhupāda wrote to his newly appointed G.B.C. secretary,\nWith Śrīla Prabhupāda’s blessings and with intense, youthful energy, Hṛdayānanda Goswami traveled constantly from one South American country to another, preaching the message of Śrīla Prabhupāda and organizing the distribution of his books in Spanish and Portuguese. Śrīla Prabhupāda was pleased to hear of his disciple’s progress.\nIn all of his letters to Śrīla Prabhupāda, Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja humbly requested Prabhupāda to visit the centers most ready to receive him, Mexico City and Caracas. Prabhupāda replied that he wanted to visit and would do so on his next Western tour.\nLeaving Bombay in January 1975, Śrīla Prabhupāda made his way west by his usual route – Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Hawaii. Hṛdayānanda Goswami flew to Hawaii just to make sure Śrīla Prabhupāda would come to Mexico. Two or three times between 1972 and 1975, the devotees in Mexico had thought Śrīla Prabhupāda was definitely coming. Once they had been within two hours of his expected arrival – with the temple fully decorated with flowers – when his secretary had phoned and said Prabhupāda would come later. On that occasion, the devotees had become overwhelmed and had thrown flowers and handfuls of cake at one another while crying and laughing.\nWhen Śrīla Prabhupāda finally came in February 1975, Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja arranged for a first-class reception at the airport. He convinced the airport and police officials that Śrīla Prabhupāda should be met with a special car just as he came down the ramp from the airplane, that he and his party should bypass immigration and customs formalities, and that police on motorcycles should escort his car all the way to the temple!\nŚrīla Prabhupāda smiled with pleasure to see all this take place. He was prepared to undergo difficulties, but he also often complained about immigration officers who were so ignorant of spiritual etiquette as to question asādhuat the border. He sometimes compared the immigrations men to watchdogs. “Ruff! Ruff! Where is your visa?” Formerly asādhuwould be allowed to enter even the king’s palace, Śrīla Prabhupāda said. But Śrīla Prabhupāda was often delayed, searched, quarantined, and even refused entry into a country. Therefore, the proper reception by the government and police of Mexico was a pleasant surprise. With sirens wailing, two police motorcycles led the way onto the highway as Śrīla Prabhupāda, profusely garlanded, sat in the rear of the black limousine, chanting on his beads and discussing Kṛṣṇa conscious plans with his leading disciples.\nFor this visit the devotees at the temple were fully prepared. Some of them remembered how Śrīla Prabhupāda had arrived in 1972 to find the temple almost empty, most of the devotees being en route to the airport to greet him. This time they had been rehearsing his arrival for weeks.\nTonio Fernandez:We practiced the conchshell, thekaratālas,everything. Someone would even go on the top of the roof and say that he saw the car of Prabhupāda. In this way we rehearsed. I was in charge of the sound control, and I had to run from there to the gate. It had been decided beforehand where everyone would sit when Prabhupāda gave a class. But when Prabhupāda actually came, someone blew the conchshell out of time, and all the devotees started to run.\nKṣiti-mohana:It was a scene with players, and the play was that Prabhupāda was coming. We had practiced, but now it was the real thing. The first car that came was Prabhupāda’s servants’. The devotees were having ecstasies because they thought it was Prabhupāda. As soon as they saw a devotee that didn’t look Mexican, they started to feel that Prabhupāda was here. Prabhupāda’s servants said to the devotees in charge of the program, “Take it easy, now Prabhupāda is going to arrive at any moment.” Then two of Prabhupāda’s servants went up to look at Prabhupāda’s room to see if it was ready or if anything was missing. After that, thekīrtanacalmed down a little so we could hear the conchshell. But we had to wait half an hour because Prabhupāda’s car was coming slowly. The boy on the roof finally saw Prabhupāda’s car, but he forgot to blow the conchshell and began to yell, “Prabhupāda is coming! Prabhupāda is coming! Havekīrtana! JayaPrabhupāda,jayaPrabhupāda!” It was a very exciting moment. Prabhupāda’s car then appeared and slowly moved onto the property. It stopped a little before the front door. Then Prabhupāda got out, and everyone threw petals from the roof. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja opened the car door, and Prabhupāda, in a very particular way, came out and stood up and looked all around. Everyone was giving his obeisances to Prabhupāda, but at the same time no one knew exactly what was happening.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja was more excited than anyone else. He was telling the devotees,“Kīrtana, kīrtana!”\nNanda-prāṇa:When Prabhupāda came to the temple, he was besieged with a rain of petals. There were two lines of devotees andkarmīsmixed, and Prabhupāda passed through. Everything was well organized. People were throwing petals. The lines started from the beginning of the entrance all the way to the temple house. Everyone was throwing petals, and Prabhupāda went all the way into the main hall where they had hisvyāsāsana.But instead of going to sit down, he went into the small temple room to see the Deities. After Prabhupāda saw the Deities, he looked at the temple room. “Oh, much improved.” Then Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja invited him to go to thevyāsāsana,where Prabhupāda sat and they washed his feet and did aguru-pūjā.It was a better standard than the first time.\nRoberto Ruiz:Ihad never seen Śrīla Prabhupāda before that. I was seeing him in pictures and in the magazine, but I had never seen personally. So I was very nervous. As soon as he will see me, I thought, he will know I am a cheater. He will look through my demoniac nature. Then finally Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived at the temple. The devotees received him with a shower of flower petals. The reception was nice, because as soon as he arrived at the airport, someone had called the temple and told us, “Prabhupāda is here. He has put his lotus feet in Mexico.”\nKṣiti-mohana:The big windows in the main hall were painted with plastic yellow paint, and the sun was shining through on Prabhupāda’s face like amber. One man was on the left side, and another strong man was on the right. They were thekṣatriyasof Prabhupāda. They were looking after him if someone wanted to cross in front of them. Prabhupāda started to sing“Vande ’ham,”and the devotees and guests tried to follow, but most of them just let it go.\nAfterguru-pūjā,Prabhupāda spoke in English to the assembled devotees. As usual, after every few sentences his words were translated by one of the devotees.\n“My dear devotees, ladies and gentlemen,” Prabhupāda began. “I am very glad to see you again, I think after four years? I was trying to come here again. I like this place, but due to various engagements and due to my old age also, I could not come earlier. But this time, by arrangement of our Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, I have been forced to come here.” At these words the devotees burst into appreciative laughter. “So I must thank you for your nice reception. I was received by police escort very nicely, and I remember once I traveled with the governor of U.P. in 1962 from Lucknow to Kanpur. So exactly we were driving in the same fashion, escorted by the police motorcycle.\n“So anyway, I am so pleased to see you, that you are interested in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very, very important for the human society. It is not exactly a religious movement as it is understood in the Western countries. Religion is described in the English dictionary as a kind of faith.”\nAnd once again the pure, transcendental message was coming from Prabhupāda’s lotuslike mouth in the company of the devotees of Mexico. Their great, saintly spiritual master, the spiritual master of the whole world, was now again with them in ISKCON Mexico, and the devotees listened and watched him with rapt attention.\n“It is very simple and easy,” Prabhupāda said, describing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. “If you do not know, if you are not educated, if you have no asset, you can simply chant the Hare Kṛṣṇamahā-mantra.And if you are educated, a logician, a philosopher, you can read our books, which are already fifty in number. There will be about seventy-five books of four hundred pages to convince the philosopher, scientist, and educationist what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are published in English as well as other European languages. Take advantage of this.\n“Along with the Deity worship in this temple, hold classes at least five hours. As in the schools and colleges, there are regular classes, forty-five minute class, then five or ten minutes recess, again forty-five minute class, in this way.\n“So we have got enough subject matter to study, and if we study all these books, to finish them it will take at least twenty-five years. So you are all young men, I request you to engage your time in reading books, in chanting, in Deity worship, in going to preach, selling books. Don’t be lazy. Always remain engaged. Then that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”\nPrabhupāda spoke briefly, then he asked for questions. A guest asked, “If everyone is spirit soul, then isn’t sex life also spiritual?”\nPrabhupāda: “There is no sex life in the spirit soul. Sex life is in the material body. We are not this body. But because we are in this body, therefore we are thinking pleasure of the body is pleasure of the soul.”\nThe second question: “Who are we, why are we here, and where are we going?”\nPrabhupāda: “You are all living entities. You wanted to come here. Just like I wanted to come in your city. I have come here. Similarly, you wanted to come to this material world and enjoy. So because you wanted to enjoy this material world you have come here. Kṛṣṇa has allowed you to come here, and you are trying to enjoy this material world. This is called struggle for existence. But you will never be happy with this material world. It is simply a struggle for existence. Therefore, you should go back to home, back to Godhead, then you’ll be happy. That’s all.”\nAt the end of the questions-and-answers session, a Mexican lady stood up spontaneously and said in English, “In the name of all the guests and all the Mexico City temple, we welcome you.”\nAfter the crowd of guests had left Prabhupāda’s room, only Hanumān and a few senior men remained. “Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Hanumān began, “Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu had one disciple in the renounced order, Choṭa Haridāsa, whom He rejected from His association because he became too much lusty after a woman. I was also one of yoursannyāsadisciples, and I too became lusty after a woman. I was wondering if you have also rejected me from your association.”\nA heavy silence followed as everyone looked at Prabhupāda, who sat with his head down. After a long pause, Prabhupāda looked up at Hanumān and said quietly, “Lord Caitanya is God. He can spread this movement all over the world in one second without the help of anyone if He likes. I am not God. I am simply a servant of God. I require so much assistance to help me spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. If someone renders even some small service to help me, I am eternally indebted to him. You have rendered so much assistance to me, how could I reject you?”\nThe devotees were moved, amazed at the depth of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s compassion. Then Hanumān began to tell Śrīla Prabhupāda about his family, about his son named Bhaktivedanta.\n“That is not very good.” Śrīla Prabhupāda shook his head. “Sometimes you may have to chastise your child, and you should not be chastising yourguru.”\nHanumān became a little disturbed. “But Śrīla Prabhupāda,” he said, “we have already grown accustomed to calling him that. What will we call him now?”\nPrabhupāda thought and then explained that actually it was all right because his name was Bhaktivedantadāsa.“Just like we name all our disciples Kṛṣṇadāsa,” Prabhupāda said. “Not Kṛṣṇa, but servant of Kṛṣṇa. Just like you are not Hanumān, but servant of.”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He asks, ‘What if we’ve already committed so many offenses to chanting? At this point, how can we purify?’ ”\nPrabhupāda: “If we don’t commit offense. Why do you voluntarily commit offense? You should not commit offense, then it will be all right – purified.”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “We don’t know how we can increase our desire for chanting.”\nPrabhupāda: “By performingsaṅkīrtana.Just like if a man drinks, and if he drinks and drinks, then he becomes a drunkard.” The example amused the audience, and they broke into laughter. “Drink more and more and you become a drunkard,” Prabhupāda continued. “Similarly, chant more and more and you become – perfect chanter.”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “What is the greatest offense?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, that is the first offense,guror avajñā, śruti-śāstra-nindanam. Śruti-śāstra-nindanam, guror avajñā.If you accept aguruand then again disobey him, then what is your position? You are not a gentleman. You promised beforeguru,before Kṛṣṇa, before fire, that ‘I shall obey your order. I shall execute this.’ If again you do not do this, then you are not even a gentleman, what to speak of a devotee. This is common sense.”\nA man asked in Spanish, “Excuse me, sir. Before, in your previous life as akarmī,what were you doing?” Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja didn’t translate the question to Śrīla Prabhupāda but immediately asserted strongly, “The pure devotee has never been akarmī.He is never akarmī.A pure devotee is always a transcendental person, right from his birth. He just came from the spiritual world to save us, to teach us this transcendental knowledge given out thousands and thousands of years ago by Lord Kṛṣṇa.” Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja continued glorifying Śrīla Prabhupāda. “What does he say?” Prabhupāda asked Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja. But he didn’t want to say anything to Śrīla Prabhupāda. He said, “Nothing, Śrīla Prabhupāda, nothing.” He would speak strongly to the man asking this question, and when Śrīla Prabhupāda would question him, Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja would be like a little child, “Oh, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about it. He’s just talking some nonsense.” Then finally Śrīla Prabhupāda just laughed and took the next question.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He asks, ‘How can we control the tongue?’ ”\nPrabhupāda: “You can takeprasādam.” Prabhupāda smiled, and his answer was so pleasurable for everyone that they began to laugh. Prabhupāda continued, “Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said like that, out of all the senses the tongue sense is very powerful. So it is very difficult to control it. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa has given us one weapon. What is that? Kṛṣṇa is very kind; therefore He has given us His remnants of foodstuff. So if we make this promise, that I shall not take anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa, then your tongue will be controlled. The tongue’s business is two-fold: one is the tongue will speak and vibrate sound, and another business is to taste nice foodstuffs. So if you engage the tongue in the matter of Kṛṣṇa’s service by vibrating Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,and if you don’t allow your tongue to touch anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa, then you become immediately Kṛṣṇa-realized. When the tongue is controlled, all other senses are automatically controlled. This is the process. Now again engage your tongue chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nOn his cue, the devotees began akīrtana.Śrīla Prabhupāda had given them everything –kīrtana, prasādam,Bhagavad-gītā,Kṛṣṇa’s service – and now, at least for a precious week, Prabhupāda was giving them himself. Every morning and night he was chanting with them and being with them, strengthening their faith in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nPrabhupāda continued to work persistently at hisBhāgavatamtranslation and purports. During his last visit to Mexico, in 1972, he had been working on the Fourth Canto. Now he was on the Fifth. That he could concentrate on translating while traveling almost constantly was a remarkable achievement. Perhaps only a writer can appreciate how extremely difficult it is to expect to make serious literary composition while at the same time moving continually from room to room, country to country, climate to climate – one week after the next. But Prabhupāda had been doing it for years. And he was able to do it because he was completely surrendered to the task and because Kṛṣṇa was directly collaborating with him. Devotees had come to expect that Śrīla Prabhupāda would live a very busy life all day, dealing with internal management, with devotees, guests, letters, lectures, travels – and then at night, instead of collapsing for eight hours of hard-earned rest, that he would lie down for a couple of hours and then rise, unaided, when almost everyone else was asleep, and execute the most demanding task of his entire day, translating and commenting on the Sanskrit verses ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.That hisBhāgavatamswere so masterfully rendered could only mean that his work was, as a prominent American professor had described it, “God-sent.” Many professors, librarians, and scholars were appreciating Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books. Prabhupāda wrote the devotees in America who were circulating his books in universities and getting reviews,\nBut how, at the age of seventy-eight, could he write such transcendental literature, which was praised and worshiped by all devotees and appreciated by religious and Sanskrit professors, and at the same time travel and tend to several thousand initiated disciples? One can only begin to understand and appreciate his endeavor.\nNanda-prāṇa:Prabhupāda was very busy with the translation. Some of us devotees took care of Prabhupāda and would stay outside his room all night. We could hear the dictating machine. At 10:00 Prabhupāda would stop the dictating machine and turn the lights off. Then about 2:00 he would rise without an alarm clock and turn the light on. He would keep going with his translations.\nDevotee:I could see every night Śrīla Prabhupāda very regularly just turned off his light. I couldn’t see inside his room, but from a little space underneath the door I could see he was working until late at night. Every devotee would take rest, but he was working until 10:00. At exactly 10:00 he would turn off his light. Then automatically, very regularly, he would turn on the light at 1:30 in the morning. I was very surprised how he could just rest for three and a half hours and work all day long. I think during the daytime he would take another nap, but from 1:30A.M.until the morning I would see the lights on. Then in the morning aftermaṅgala-āratihe would go on his morning walk.\nIn Chapultepec Park Śrīla Prabhupāda liked to walk on the narrow Road of the Philosophers. The early mornings were cold, and he wore his long saffron coat with hood. The simple canvas shoes he wore would become wet from the dew on the grass. His rapid pace made his younger disciples hustle to keep up. Often Prabhupāda’s words would go untranslated, and the Mexican boys could catch only a phrase or two. But they were happy to be with their spiritual master. He was interested in the many varieties of trees and sometimes asked about them. Once, stopping before a large dead tree, he examined it carefully.\n“What is the difference between this dead tree and the others?” he asked. One disciple replied, “This tree is dead because its time is over.”\n“No,” Prabhupāda said and tapped his cane on the ground.\nAnother devotee ventured, “This tree has a certainkarmadifferent from the others.”\n“No.” Prabhupāda again tapped his cane on the ground. “The difference is that there is not a soul in this tree.”\nWhile walking among the trees in Chapultepec Park, Prabhupāda spotted a certain eucalyptus twig above his head. He stopped. From as early as 1967 in San Francisco, he had used the twigs of eucalyptus trees as toothbrushes, a Western substitute for the antisepticnīmtwigs of India.\nKṣiti-mohana:Prabhupāda pointed to the tree and told Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, “I want that stick.” It was a very small one. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja heard Prabhupāda. He said, “Prabhupāda wants that. Come on, bring it down, bring it down.” He wanted to give it to Prabhupāda. So we made a pyramid of men, with three men on the bottom then two men on top of them, and one skinny devotee climbed on top. When the devotee stood and reached up, he was still about fifty centimeters short. But when he made an effort to reach it, the whole pyramid fell to the ground. Prabhupāda was watching them, smiling and laughing. Again they made the pyramid bigger, and the devotee tried to reach it again, but again they fell down. Then more devotees tried. They became wet because of the grass, and Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja was very excited, saying, “Come on, Prabhupāda wants that. Prabhupāda wants that. Keep moving.” Prabhupāda was smiling at the fun, sometimes watching the twig and sometimes watching the devotees. A third time they tried the pyramid, and it fell down. But the fourth time it worked, and the devotee stood up and broke the twig from the tree. He gave it to Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, who gave it to Prabhupāda. Prabhupāda held it in his hand, inspected it for a minute, and then threw it away.\nOften during his morning walk Śrīla Prabhupāda would only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, the universal language in which all the Spanish and English-speaking devotees could participate without difficulty. For many of the Mexican disciples this was their first personal contact with Śrīla Prabhupāda, and they were awed. Occasionally, on a walk Śrīla Prabhupāda would suddenly sit on a bench, and as many as fifteen disciples would quickly gather at his feet, looking up to him.\nMunipriya:Prabhupāda sat down in the park. The people around Prabhupāda also sat and came to see Prabhupāda. People were sitting and looking to Prabhupāda, and he was also looking at all the devotees. And all the devotees were waiting to hear from Prabhupāda. Nobody makes a sound. Prabhupāda looked at all the devotees and then said, “Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa!” Then all the devotees came to love him. Because all the people were waiting for Śrīla Prabhupāda to talk about philosophy. These boys don’t expect Śrīla Prabhupāda to suddenly say, “Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa!” And they came to love him, because Prabhupāda said this in the middle of a silence.\nWhen Prabhupāda saw the joggers he remarked, “If they say they don’t care about the ultimate meaning of life, why are they running? They are running,” he said, “because they are all afraid of death.” They passed a martial arts class – two rows of men in black leotards, gesturing aggressively in unison. “Who are they fighting?” he asked. He said that when he explains philosophically that everyone is afraid of death, people reply, “No, I’m not afraid.” “But if they are not afraid of death, then why are they doing all this?” And he gestured toward the mock fighting and laughed.\nOne morning he stopped at a large garbage container and asked about the sign on it. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja replied, “It says, ‘Put the garbage in this place.’ ”\n“Then the whole material world will be there,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied. “But it is too big to put into this container.”\nAnother morning, riding back to the temple in the car, Prabhupāda asked the driver, Nanda-prāṇa, to go faster. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja translated Prabhupāda’s order to the driver, who sped up slightly. Śrīla Prabhupāda then astonished them by asking, “Quepasa,Nanda-prāṇa?” And when the ride was over, he added, “Muchas gracias.”\nOn Prabhupāda’s second morning in Mexico City, he spoke fromBhagavad-gītā2.12on how the soul is eternally individual. “When you actually understand,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “that you are not American or Indian or Mexican, but that you are spirit soul, then your spiritual life begins.” He said the symptom of identifying oneself with the soul is that one becomes jubilant, jolly. And to attain this, one has to undergo a process of purification. “Without purification, you cannot understand God. But Lord Caitanya’s prescription, which we are simply propagating, is ‘Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.’ So I am very glad to see that you Mexican young boys, girls, ladies, and gentlemen are coming here and joining and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. I request you to continue this procedure. Please come here, join this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,and takeprasādamand go home. And surely you will be purified and qualified for going back to home, back to Godhead.”\nQuestions and answers followed, with Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja translating.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He wants to know if within marriage it is possible to achieve perfection.”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes. Human being is meant for marriage, not the cats and dogs. If you can remain without marriage, without sex life, that is very good, but if you can’t, then marry and be gentleman and remain peaceful.”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He wants to know if one can achieve Kṛṣṇa consciousness outside the temple.”\nPrabhupāda: “Oh, yes. You have to follow the rules and regulations, that’s all.”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “What about when one breaks the principles? Can Kṛṣṇa forgive him?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, Kṛṣṇa can forgive you once, twice, but not regularly.” Prabhupāda smiled, and the devotees laughed with him.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “Sometimes people come and join our movement and follow the four principles, but there appears to be a fault in their character. So he says that by following the process gradually the defects will be diminished. But is there any way to more rapidly – ”\nPrabhupāda: “If a man comes and follows the regulative principles even for some time and again he falls down, so long as he has followed, that asset is permanent. Anything spiritual asset is never lost. So little, little, little … when it is complete cent percent then you become liberated. Spiritual asset is never lost. Even if a person comes to the temple, follows the regulative principles for some time, and again falls down, he is not a loser – he is a gainer. Others, who do not take this lesson, who keep outside and perform their so-called material duties very perfectly, they are losers.\n“So at least for some time let every one of you come here and follow the restriction. If you become perfect, it is all right. But even if you go away, whatever you have done, that is your permanent asset. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā:svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.Even that little asset can help you become freed from the greatest danger. So in theBhagavad-gītāit is stated even if such a person falls down, he is given a chance in next life to take birth in a very rich aristocratic family or in a very piousbrāhmaṇafamily. A little spiritual asset in this human form of life will at least guarantee your next life in a very nice family. But without spiritual life there is no guarantee whether you are going to become human being or cat or dog.”\nOne day Śrīla Prabhupāda asked to sample the contents of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa’s plate directly from the altar. He tasted theprasādamand approved. But on another occasion he went to the kitchen and found that thepūjārīshad put new flowers in the same place as old, rejected flowers. “These are the flowers to offer to Kṛṣṇa?” he asked with disapproval. He requested Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja to find a qualified devotee to become the headpūjārīand oversee the Deity worship. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja brought Kṣiti-mohana before Prabhupāda in his room, and Prabhupāda began to talk about how the most important service was to increase the Deity worship. “No,” Kṣiti-mohana replied, “saṅkīrtanais most important.”\n“You should never say, ‘No!’ to Prabhupāda,” Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja corrected.\n“Yes, Prabhupāda,” Kṣiti-mohana replied. Prabhupāda then asked him to become the headpūjārī.Kṣiti-mohana, speaking in Spanish, told Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja that he was afraid he would commit too many offenses to the Deity. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja assured him that he could learn as he went. Because Prabhupāda wanted him to do it, he would gradually become expert.\n“Every disciple will think hisguruis good and that others are bogus,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied. “But there is a standard for who is spiritual master. Spiritual master means one who is the best servant of God. But one who does not accept the existence of God, he’s amūḍha,a rascal. A rascal cannot become a spiritual master.”\nProfessor: “Do you have any opinion about some of the other Indian spiritual masters?” The professor named several well-knowngurus.At the mention of a certain popular youngguru,Śrīla Prabhupāda interrupted, “He says that he is God himself. Then he is a bogus. How can he be God? God is so cheap? Only the foolish persons will accept him. Those who have no knowledge.”\nAt the mention of a famous meditator, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “I think he doesn’t speak anything about God. He speaks something on material prosperity.” At the mention of anotherguru,Prabhupāda replied, “He also says, ‘I am Bhagavān.’ Therefore he is bogus. How can you say you yourself are Bhagavān, God? So even if people accept him as God because he shows some jugglery or creates a little gold, then if by creating some gold he is God, then there is a bigger God that has created the gold mine. Why should I go to this tiny God? I must go to the big God who has created all the gold mines.”\nProfessor: “I have great difficulty with the meaning of the termperfect knowledge.Could you – ”\nPrabhupāda: “Perfect knowledge means what you say is correct. There is no mistake.”\nProfessor: “Under any and all circumstances?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, that is perfect knowledge. Not like the scientists. They change. They say, ‘Yes, it was this, and now it is changed.’ This is not perfect knowledge. Perfect knowledge is that which you say, that is correct forever. Just like a man dies. If someone says, ‘Man dies,’ it is perfect knowledge. It is correct forever.”\nProfessor: “Suppose he is reincarnated?”\nPrabhupāda:“Diesmeans the body dies. The soul does not die.Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.”\nThe Indian guest asked Śrīla Prabhupāda aboutvarṇa-saṅkara,the rapid increase in unplanned-for, unwanted progeny. Prabhupāda replied that since there was no following of thevarṇāśramasystem, the world population was going to hell. “Thevarṇa-saṅkarahas come to such an extent,” he said, “that they are killing the child, and that is legal. They have come down to such an extreme position.”\nThe Indian man replied, “But surely there is a practical point of view also. If there is nothing to eat, what will happen?”\nPrabhupāda: “Who says nothing to eat? That is also their manufacture.”\nIndian guest: “I meant the figures which are published.”\nPrabhupāda: “Especially we who are Indian know it is advertised that we are poverty-stricken. All over the world that is advertised. Wherever I go they say, ‘Oh, you’re coming from India?’ Because our government is simply begging. But who is dying of poverty? Dying is going on in other countries also – they are committing suicide. And maybe some persons are dying out of starvation. You cannot stop death. Suppose you have got enough food. That means everything is solved? In America there is enough food. Why are they becoming hippies? There is no shortage of food. Nothing. Everything is abundant. But why are they becoming hippies? They are lying down on the street, in the park. I’ve seen in London, the St. James’s Park. They are sleeping, and the police are screaming, ‘Hey! Get out! Get out!’ So why? The British nation is not poor nation. The American nation is not poor nation.”\nIndian guest: “Poverty is also comparative.”\nPrabhupāda: “No. I saw in Amsterdam – simply full of hippies lying down on the street with no food or shelter. It is going on.”\nIndian guest: “The hippies are not lying in the park because they lack food.”\nPrabhupāda: “They must be wanting something. They are in need of something.”\nIndian guest: “But not necessarily food.”\nPrabhupāda: “One body is in need of food, another body is in need of something else. They are needy. Everyone is needy. That you have to accept. I have seen in Los Angeles. I was walking in the Beverly Hills quarter, and one hippie boy is coming from a very nice house. Beverly Hills, that quarter is resided by all rich class. And he has got very nice car, but he is hippie. Why? His father is very rich man. He has got nice car. He might be very educated. Then why he is hippie? What is the answer?”\nIndian guest: “He’s frustrated.”\nPrabhupāda: “That means he is in need. That is the question. You may be in need of food, I may be in need of some woman, he may be in need of some money. In this way everyone is needy. Therefore, ultimately everyone should search after God. Then every need will be fulfilled.”\nAnother evening a former Miss Mexico came to see Prabhupāda. Accompanied by two sophisticated, wealthy-looking men, ex–Miss Mexico was very glamorous, fluttering her eyelashes as she talked. Although not quite in her element, she tried to be diplomatic and was effusively appreciative of everything. “I really like your center here,” she told Prabhupāda through a translator. “And I think I would like to come back and learn more about it.” Prabhupāda was unaffected. “Why do you want to come here?” he asked. “You don’t understand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Have you read my books?”\n“What? What?”\n“Have you read my books?”\n“No, I haven’t.”\n“Well, do you know our philosophy?”\n“Ah, no.”\n“If you want to come here, then you listen and understand this philosophy. It is most important. Then you can say you want to come back.” Prabhupāda then turned his attention to other people in the room, and ex–Miss Mexico and her friends sat in silence, listening.\nDevotee:I was the doorkeeper outside Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room, and I was very concerned about my job. I was taking it as my life and soul, guarding the door of Śrīla Prabhupāda. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja told me, “If you get the opportunity, just go into the room and see how Prabhupāda is talking to the guests. It is very important for you. So I thought, “Well, I have permission for that.” So when a man in the government working in the educational program came and got an interview with Śrīla Prabhupāda, I got the opportunity to go inside the room. I thought, “Well, maybe Śrīla Prabhupāda will not be angry with me if I go inside the room. Let me try.”\nI went into the room, and I was listening to the talk. At that time my English wasn’t nice, but I could get some of the matter they were talking about. Śrīla Prabhupāda was explaining the importance of the Vedic point of view in the educational program. He was explaining that the main point in the Vedic system was to teach that we are servant of God. I thought maybe Śrīla Prabhupāda would be very diplomatic. He will not go directly to the point. But he was preaching very, very directly. He was making all the points to this man. He was telling him how we teach our children from the very childhood in the Vedic standard of waking the children early in the morning, taking bath, attendingmaṅgala-ārati.\nBut the most surprise for me occurred when the man finally had to leave. He was saying, “Oh, Your Divine Grace, I am very glad I could have the opportunity to speak with you.” Śrīla Prabhupāda was talking in a very friendly way with him. The man was receptive. It was not an atmosphere of challenging. Śrīla Prabhupāda was very nice with him. Prabhupāda then told the man, “We have a lot of books. You are working with books in the government. You are giving books to the schools. So I will be very glad if you can take some of these and read, and then you will see in a more broad way all the topics we were discussing today.” The man said, “Oh, yes. I would like to.”\nAt that time I was doing book distribution as my full-time engagement. I thought, “Oh, I don’t know if Prabhupāda wants to ask him for some money. I think Prabhupāda is not going to ask him for money because he is a guest.” I thought that Prabhupāda was probably going to say, “Yes, keep the books and good-bye. Hare Kṛṣṇa.” I expected that he would let the othersannyāsīstake care of selling any books.\nBut I was very surprised that when the man agreed to take the books, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “Please give him some books.” The devotees then gave some of our Spanish translation books. We only had a few books, but we immediately gave them. Then the man said, “Is there anything I have to pay for these books?” I thought Śrīla Prabhupāda would say, “No, just keep it with you,” and “Hare Kṛṣṇa.” But Prabhupāda said very gravely, “If you want to give something for the books, we will accept.” Then the man took out some money, and Prabhupāda made a sign indicating that he should please give it to one of the devotees.\nIt was a surprise to me just to see how Śrīla Prabhupāda didn’t miss an opportunity. He was the teacher of all of us, an expert at making transcendentalsaṅkīrtana.I learned from that incident that I will never feel embarrassed in front of anyone just to ask for a donation for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books. I felt at that time that Śrīla Prabhupāda himself had a lot of respect for his books, not because they were his books, but because the books – as he told us, and as we could see by his practical example – the books were his whole life.\nOne evening, after lecturing in the temple room, Prabhupāda was talking in his room with Hṛdayānanda Goswami. Sitting on Prabhupāda’s desk was a world globe, and Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja was showing Prabhupāda the extent of his Latin American preaching field. Śrīla Prabhupāda sat, gently spinning the globe, finally stopping it with his finger on Mexico. “What do you know about this country?” he asked. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja began telling him as much as he knew about the culture, government, and history of Mexico. Then Prabhupāda gave the globe another spin, stopping it with his finger on Argentina, and Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja told what he knew about the people and life of Argentina.\n“Now we will give you some information about India,” said Prabhupāda, smiling. And he named India’s exports and the provinces from which they came. He spoke of the relationship between ancient India and South America, of Lord Rāmacandra, who millions of years ago had gone to Brazil. From Śrī Laṅkā to Brazil had been a tunnel, and all the gold of Rāvaṇa’s kingdom had come through that tunnel from Brazil. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja was thrilled that Śrīla Prabhupāda was including him in such an intimate, friendly talk, and they continued exchanging information while pointing to the places on the globe.\nOne day Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja came into Prabhupāda’s room looking unhappy. “What is the difficulty?” Prabhupāda asked him. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja took pride in never complaining to Prabhupāda or bringing him bad news and disturbing him. But having almost reached his breaking point, he confessed, “Prabhupāda it’s impossible here. They are always stealing!”\nPrabhupāda consoled him. “Yes, in one of our Indian centers also they have stolen a rug. What can I do?” Prabhupāda said, as if sharing his disciple’s helplessness. But then he said, “Actually, my father had a friend who owned a factory. He would pay the factory workers a small wage. Once someone complained, ‘Why do you underpay your workers?’ Then he said, ‘No, I pay them so much and they steal so much. It comes out to the proper amount.’ ” Prabhupāda began to laugh. “My father told me that if you have a servant and he doesnotsteal from you, then he is not bona fide. He’s not a bona fide servant.” Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja laughed along with Prabhupāda, and his unhappiness vanished.\nOnce Prabhupāda sent a message for Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja to come immediately. When Hṛdayānanda ran into Prabhupāda’s room and offered obeisances, he found Prabhupāda sitting in a leisurely position, reading theKṛṣṇabook. Prabhupāda looked up with great happiness and asked, “Have you read these books?” Prabhupāda was enjoying his own book, not because he had written the book but because the book was Kṛṣṇa. “Have you read these books?” Prabhupāda repeated.\n“Yes, Prabhupāda, a little.”\n“Aren’t they wonderful?” asked Prabhupāda. “EspeciallyCaitanya-caritāmṛta.They are so wonderful.” Having said this, Prabhupāda returned his attention to theKṛṣṇabook, reading silently to himself. After sitting for a few minutes, Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja gratefully left the room, desiring to follow Prabhupāda’s example.\nIn hisBhagavad-gītālectures, Śrīla Prabhupāda was methodically proceeding through the Second Chapter, now discussing the distinction between the eternal soul and the temporary body. Sometimes he lectured both morning and evening. When beginning his explanation of the fourteenth verse, he said, “So from last night’s discussion it is to be concluded that we are not going to die.” But in preparation for the next life, Prabhupāda explained, we have to tolerate material pains and pleasures. “Sometimes the rules and regulations are there. They may be painful, but we cannot give them up. We have to learn how to tolerate.” Prabhupāda quoted a Bengali proverb that said, “Anything you practice with your body you can learn to tolerate.” So if by practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness you can go back to home, back to Godhead, why should you neglect? That will solve all your problems. After the lecture someone asked, “What are the characteristics of a person who has realized that he is not this body?”\n“He’s engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness,” Śrīla Prabhupāda replied. “He doesn’t know anything but Kṛṣṇa. That is normal condition.”\nOne evening, after an unusual number of impertinent questions, Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja stopped translating and instructed the crowd not to ask nonsensical questions. Immediately one of the ladies raised her hand. “I’ve heard from the devotees,” she began, “that at the time of leaving my body it will be a very important test for my life for getting my next body. I’ve also heard from the devotees that it is important for us to think of Lord Kṛṣṇa at that time of passing away of our body. What I want to ask Your Divine Grace is: Is it as good as thinking of Kṛṣṇa at the time of my death to think of you?” Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja presented her question to Prabhupāda. Śrīla Prabhupāda smiled. “Yes, that is very good. You will get the same result.”\nIn the morning for his breakfast Prabhupāda ate lightly of fruit and cashews. He especially liked a local fruit known asguavana,and he drankguavanajuice every day. At noon he also ate lightly, avoiding thesamosāsandpakorāsand eating mostlydāl,rice,capātīs,and thesabjī.The Mexican devotees would wait eagerly outside Prabhupāda’s door to take the remnants from his plate. They were particularly eager for a bite of anything Prabhupāda had tasted.\nKṣiti-mohana:One morning Śrutakīrti gave me the plate remnants of Prabhupāda. It contained milk, oranges already sucked, and skins of chickpeas. There was also ginger. At that time there was aŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamclass going on, but when the devotees saw me with the plate some of them left the class and ran toward me. They started to take pieces of orange and ginger. One devotee got pushed and fell down. That disturbed the class, and the devotee giving the class was very upset. Some of the devotees kept sitting, but some of them, when they saw the remnants, left the place and ran upstairs and started to fight also. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda opened his door because of the noise, and he saw everything. He smiled and went to his room again.\nNanda-prāṇa:One of the devotees was a bodyguard when he was akarmī,taking care of important people in the government, so he was already involved in these things. Mostly in the nighttime there were some of us who were just taking watch three or four hours outside of his room, taking care of him. We were thinking that maybe some dangerous man or some crazy man is coming, and they would want to make something with Śrīla Prabhupāda. We wanted to put Śrīla Prabhupāda very secure. Every night I was doing the schedule from 9:00 at night until 2:00. At that time I was supposed to go and wake up the next guard.\nṚtu:I was taking care of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s sleep security. I used to chant rounds during the night. So it was midnight and I was chanting, and this devotee, Jagannātha Miśra, told me that I should not chant so loud because it would bother Śrīla Prabhupāda. I said no, Prabhupāda doesn’t mind if we chant loud. I kept on chanting loudly, and then I saw Śrīla Prabhupāda open the curtains in his room. He was standing there very humbly, not angry, but smiling. He made a motion to me, meaning please do not chant so loudly. Then he folded his palms and was smiling.\nKṣiti-mohana:I was like a helper. If the servants needed something, we were right there to get it. We would rest, taking care of the door, day and night. Once they had a problem with Prabhupāda’s tape recorder. At that time Prabhupāda had to stop translating. So Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja called me and told me that he heard that I knew how to fix tape recorders and electricity. I went into Prabhupāda’s room, and Prabhupāda was reading theCaitanya-caritāmṛta.He was moving his toes. There was atulasīthere on his desk. By using his hands Prabhupāda was showing me that the tape recorder didn’t work. He wanted to be busy with his service. When I looked at it, the only thing wrong was that the plug wasn’t very well plugged in. I fixed it and put the tape on, and Prabhupāda’s voice started to come out. Then he said, “Everything is all right. Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa.” Then he asked me some questions through Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja’s translating. He asked, “Are there cows here in Mexico? Do you kill them and eat them?” Also he asked what is the coin in Mexico. When he asked about the cows, I answered that. And when he asked about the coin, I said it is apeso.When Prabhupāda heard about the cows, he shook his head. Then he was explaining that everywhere they have cows and they kill them off and eat them, and that’s why civilization is as it is now, in crisis. Now society is paying reactions, and they are going to pay more reactions because of that. Then he told me, now you can leave. I had to leave because my service was to take care of the door, and Prabhupāda had other services.\nMunipriya:I was a guard at the door. After 2:00 in the morning Prabhupāda came out in agamchā.I said, “JayaPrabhupāda,Haribol!”I wanted to get down and offer him my obeisances. Prabhupāda said, “No, no, just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nTonio Fernandez:Iwas in charge of the microphone. One time I was adjusting it right in front of Prabhupāda, and he saw me and smiled. I felt very happy. I had no time to dance with the other devotees because I was in charge of the sound system. One day I put aside the sound and started dancing. Prabhupāda saw me, and I felt that he was thinking, “You must go back to your sound,” and so I went back, because that was my service.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja:We were very anxious to serve Śrīla Prabhupāda nicely because he so very rarely ever came to Latin America. Therefore whatever he wanted, whenever he said, “Why don’t you bring this?” we would have three or four devotees standing by like firemen, and they would practically slide down the banister and jump into two or three different cars and tear out of the driveway on two wheels with tires screeching. They would have a race to see who could bring it back first. Usually within ten or fifteen minutes they would have it, whatever Prabhupāda wanted. One time I brought Prabhupāda his breakfast plate, and he said, “Aren’t there any cashew nuts?” I immediately ran out to the banister and shouted, “Cashew nuts!” Immediately they started jumping down the stairs, and cars were screeching out of the driveway. While Prabhupāda was still eating his breakfast, we brought in the nuts. Then he said, “No, never mind, I don’t need them.”\nThe lastBhagavad-gītāclass Prabhupāda gave in Mexico was on the seventeenth verse of the Second Chapter. “If you simply become interested in this small span of life,” Prabhupāda said, “say fifty or sixty or a hundred years at most, but you neglect your eternal existence, is that intelligence? We are teaching that science, and theBhagavad-gītāis there. Take advantage of it.”\nAs always there were questions.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He would like to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, but he wants to know if you believe in God.” The absurdity of this question made the devotees laugh.\nPrabhupāda: “Hm? What is that?”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He wants to know if you believe in God.”\nPrabhupāda: “I don’t believe in God? You believe in God. Why I’ll not believe? If you can believe, I can believe also. It is not believing though – it is fact. We are explaining the fact, how the existence of God is there. There is no question of believe or not believe – the fact is fact.”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “When we offer something to you, for example to your picture, he wants to know if spiritually, simply by the act of offering, do we become purified, or is the spiritual master actually aware of the offering?”\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, yes. The spiritual master is the representative of God. Whatever you offer to the spiritual master, it goes to God.”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “His point is, is the spiritual master actually conscious of our activities?”\nPrabhupāda: “The spiritual master may not be conscious, but God is conscious, and through God he is also conscious.”\nFebruary 17, 1975After seven full days in Mexico City, Prabhupāda was ready to leave for Caracas. Everyone gathered in the temple to hear his last talk. As usual, Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, sitting at the feet of Prabhupāda’svyāsāsana,translated his talk.\n“We have left our home and our father,” Prabhupāda began, “and we are in this fallen material world. And we are suffering too much. It is exactly like a very rich man’s son who leaves home for independence and wanders all over the world unnecessarily taking trouble. A rich man’s son has nothing to do. His father’s property is sufficient for his comfortable life. Still, as we have got examples now in the Western countries, many rich men’s sons become hippies, leave home, and unnecessarily take trouble. Our position as living entities within this material world is exactly like that. We have voluntarily come into this material world for sense enjoyment. And in sense enjoyment we have forgotten our supreme father, God. The material nature’s duty is to give us simply miserable condition of life.\n“Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga-vāñchā kare – pāśate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dharemeans as soon as the living entity wants to enjoy life without Kṛṣṇa, without God, immediately he becomes under the clutches ofmāyā.So this is our position. We are under the control ofmāyā,and we can get out of it also, as it is said in theBhagavad-gītā, mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te:‘Anyone who surrenders unto Me, he gets out of the control ofmāyā.’\n“We are therefore preaching all over the world Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or God consciousness, and teaching the people how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa and thus get out of the clutches ofmāyā.We have no other desire or ambition besides this. We plainly say, ‘Here is God. You surrender unto Him, you always think of Him, offer your obeisances, then your life will be successful.’ But the people in general, they are exactly like madmen. Simply for sense gratification they are working so hard day and night. So devotees are very sorry to see their plight. Prahlāda Mahārāja said that ‘I am very sorry for these persons.’ Who are they?Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyārtha-māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān.These rascals,vimūḍhān,they have created a civilization, gorgeous civilization. What is that?\n“Just like in your country – a gorgeous truck for sweeping. The business is sweeping, and for that they have manufactured a gorgeous truck. The sweeping can be done by hand – there are so many men. But they are loitering in the street, and a huge truck is required for sweeping. It is creating huge sound, and it is very dangerous also. But they are thinking this is advancement of civilization. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja said,māyā-sukhāya.Just to get relief from sweeping. But there is no relief. They have got other troubles. But they are thinking, ‘Now we haven’t got to sweep. It is a great relief.’ Similarly, a simple razor can be used for shaving, but they have got so many machines. And to manufacture the machines, so many factories.\n“So in this way, if we study item by item, this kind of civilization is called demoniac civilization.Ugra-karma.Ugra-karmameans ferocious activities. So there is no objection for the material comforts, but actually you have to see whether they are comforts or miserable conditions. Therefore our human form of life is meant for saving time to develop our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is not meant for wasting unnecessarily. Because we do not know when the next death is coming.\n“And if we do not prepare ourselves for the next life – because at any moment we can die – then we have to accept a body offered by the material nature. Therefore I wish that all of you who have come to join this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement live very carefully so thatmāyāmay not snatch you from the hand of Kṛṣṇa. We can keep ourself very steady simply by following the regulative principles and chanting minimum sixteen rounds. Then we are safe. So you have got some information about the perfection of life, don’t misuse it. Try to keep it very steadily, and your life will be successful.\n“So if we follow the regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds, then our life will be perfect. I think this instruction you will follow; that is my desire. Thank you very much.”\nTonio Fernandez:The last time Prabhupāda spoke was in the morning. He said, “I wish all of you will go back to Kṛṣṇa.” I remember those words very nicely, because I understand that all the desires of a pure devotee are fulfilled. So I think his desires must be fulfilled. But when Prabhupāda left, I personally felt alone because I was practically with him only for eight days. It was a different style of life.\nNanda-prāṇa:When Prabhupāda was leaving the house, he was coming down the stairs, and they helped this one boy, Govinda dāsa, who was four years old, to make a garland. He was waiting for Śrīla Prabhupāda downstairs. When Prabhupāda came down, this boy was going to put the garland, but he was too little and could not reach Prabhupāda’s head. So Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja took the child and lifted him up so that Govinda dāsa was going to put the garland on Prabhupāda’s head. But before he could put it, Prabhupāda took his hands and made the boy put the garland on himself.\nRoberto Ruiz:After coming from Chapultepec Park and chanting his rounds, then Śrīla Prabhupāda went away. It was wonderful because all the devotees went out. When the car was leaving the temple, it looked like a rug, like a carpet, all the devotees were offering obeisances. It was ecstatic. They were waiting for Prabhupāda to come again, but it wasn’t possible.\nTonio Fernandez:When we start talking about Prabhupāda’s visit to Mexico, we remember a lot of things. And when we start talking, we can go on talking and we can remember a lot of things. Talking about Śrīla Prabhupāda is very hard because really we can’t know him in eight days. The eight days passed so quickly, like a minute. It was the best thing that happened in our life, to meet with Śrīla Prabhupāda and his devotees. The whole mercy was given to me also because I stayed closely. The devotees were struggling always to see Prabhupāda – themātājīs,thebrahmacārīs –but I also stayed with him. When Prabhupāda left, all of us stood at the gates looking at the car, and the atmosphere was very sad. I can’t tell by words, but only feel it. It is a feeling of separation. When one serves the spiritual master one serves Kṛṣṇa. It was the most sad farewell for me.\nCaracasFebruary 18, 1975It was late at night. For years the devotees had been hoping Prabhupāda would visit. Every year they heard he was coming, but every year he didn’t. But now he had come. In the temple conchshells sounded, and thekīrtanawas uproarious. Because of the government restrictions, the devotees had not publicized Prabhupāda’s arrival, which didn’t seem to matter, since the temple was more crowded than ever before, with dozens of guests, a reporter, and a television news crew with bright floodlights and cameras.\nThe leading book distributor in the temple washed Prabhupāda’s feet as Prabhupāda sat on a raisedvyāsāsanaoverlooking a hundred persons. The devotees, many of them from other countries in South America, and the guests, friends, seekers, and the curious, filled every inch of floor space. As Śrīla Prabhupāda sat, he beheld the two golden forms of the Gaura-Nitāi Deities. He made obeisances to Them when he first entered the room, and now he spoke of Their mercy. “You are very fortunate,” he said. “These two Prabhus, Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, are present with us tonight. There is a song. You can follow?” And he began to sing.\nNo instruments or voices accompanied his singing, which carried through the still room. Everyone sat in hushed silence, fixed on him, as he sang alone.\nNow that Prabhupāda was in Caracas, seeing so many devotees and seeing Gaura-Nitāi, presiding from Their simple altar, he was most impressed and moved by the mercy of Gaura-Nitāi. These two Lords, he sang, were the essence of all incarnations and the most merciful. In this particular incarnation the Lord said He would go everywhere to distribute His love, and here was the proof. They had come so far from Their original place in Nadiyā in Bengal. Prabhupāda himself was traveling far – even on this day he had already traveled hundreds of miles – and yet the two Prabhus were already here waiting, with arms upraised, shining effulgently. They had come to this distant place, Venezuela, and Prabhupāda was deeply touched at how They had extended Their mercy to the whole world. Tears glided down his cheeks, and his voice broke.\nThe devotees became wonderstruck, appreciating Prabhupāda’s vision of the two Deities on the altar. Prabhupāda wasn’t thinking that he was in South America with some Spanish-speaking people, but he was seeing his beloved Lords and feeling how They were delivering love of God to the fallen souls. Seeing Prabhupāda’s tears and hearing his choked voice, the people themselves became thrilled to behold genuine, transcendental ecstasy. It was like the ecstasy of Akrūra on his way to Vṛndāvana. Akrūra had been thinking of Kṛṣṇa the whole time he was traveling, but when he arrived in Vṛndāvana and saw the actual imprints of Kṛṣṇa’s feet in the dust, he suddenly became mad in ecstasy and fell to the ground, crying, “How wonderful!” Similarly, Śrīla Prabhupāda was always living within the mercy of Gaura-Nitāi and Their mission, but suddenly seeing Them with arms upraised in this particular place, where They were encouraging the people of South America to take to this simple, joyful process – a process which does not even require knowledge or understanding, but simply to chant Kṛṣṇa’s holy names – seeing this mercy Prabhupāda himself was far more impressed than anyone by the mercy of these two Prabhus.\nAlthough the Deity, the temple, and the devotees had only become manifest through Prabhupāda’s preaching, the fact that they were all here, flourishing before he had ever come, moved him to a visible ecstasy of love as the servant of the Lord. He was awed by the potency of Gaura-Nitāi.\nThe Caracas temple was situated on a hill overlooking the city. From his garden, Prabhupāda, sitting in his rocking chair, could see the whole city of Caracas, “the city of eternal spring,” spread out before him, shimmering in the valley below. Beyond the city loomed a tall green mountain. It was a spectacular vista. As the morning air warmed, Śrīla Prabhupāda removed his sweater and placed it on the branches of a nearby tree. He sat, chanting on his beads. Later, he took off his shirt, placing it on another branch, and sat basking in the sunshine, chanting.\nPrabhupāda’s traveling servant and secretary were glad to see him sitting so restfully in the sunshine, since he traveled rapidly and his body was advanced in years. After only a few days here, he would quickly visit Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, New York, London, Tehran, Bombay, Calcutta, and then preside over the international gathering of his disciples in Māyāpur. After Māyāpur, Prabhupāda would go to Vṛndāvana for the grand opening of the Krishna-Balaram temple. In connection with the Māyāpur festival and the Vṛndāvana temple opening many matters were still pending, and all over the world ISKCON affairs and devotees were awaiting Prabhupāda’s scrutiny and direction. But Prabhupāda’s traveling servants thought that if for a few days he received no mail or phone calls, then that was good. They were satisfied simply seeing their spiritual master sitting and chanting in the sunshine.\nJagajīvana:There was a little balcony above Śrīla Prabhupāda’s garden. I would go and sit there and just look at Prabhupāda, because in that way my eyes could become purified. I was also thinking how in Navadvīpa-dhāma there is a place called Nṛsiṁhapallī, where Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva rested on His way back to the spiritual world after killing Hiraṇyakaśipu. Did the Lord need to rest? No, but it was part of His pastime, and His devotees reciprocate with the Lord according to the Lord’s desire. So I thought if my spiritual master wants to sit and overlook the city in a relaxed mood, let me worship him in that setting.\nThe devotees of Caracas were delighted that Prabhupāda was gazing upon their city. They felt that he was blessing the poor-hearted people of Caracas just by glancing down upon their homes as he chanted. While Prabhupāda was present at their temple, thesaṅkīrtanadevotees of Caracas continued going down daily to the city to distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books to the conditioned souls. But just knowing he was there looking over the city gave them strength.\n“From nature’s study,” Prabhupāda said, “we can see one tree is producing a particular type of fruit and flower. There is no revolution. It is standard. But these people, because they have no standard, they change every moment, every year. Nature’s way is that the sun is rising from the eastern side, and that is standard.” Prabhupāda chuckled. “They will say, ‘Let the sun rise from the north.’ It is childish, simply childish. Eastern philosophers, Western philosophers – what are these different philosophies? Philosophy is philosophy.”\nWhile walking, Prabhupāda spoke of the wonders of Mount Sumeru, the celestial mountain of the demigods. “On the top of the Sumeru Hill,” he said, “there is a big tree, and the juice, after falling down, turns into a river of mango juice. And the blackberries, they are just like the bodies of elephants, but with small seeds. They also turn into rivers like the rivers of thejambūfruit. Both banks of the river, being moistened by this juice and dried by air and sunshine, it becomes gold. And that gold is used by the denizens of heaven for their ornaments, helmets, bracelets, and belts. But where is gold here? Just paper. They cannot make even gold coins. Everything is reducing to poverty. In our childhood we have seen gold coins and silver coins. Now there is no such thing. Plastic and paper.” As he walked, Prabhupāda observed the beautiful park. “Yes,” he said, “it is a nice garden.”\nDevotees crowded near Prabhupāda as he walked, sometimes too near, almost bumping him. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja translated questions from the devotees.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He wants to know the relation between the Vedic culture of India and the cultures that were originally in Latin America. There seems to be some similarity.”\nPrabhupāda: “Formerly the whole world was Vedic culture. They have deteriorated. In India only, a glimpse is still maintained.” Prabhupāda then told them how Lord Rāmacandra had once come to Brazil, then the headquarters of Rāvaṇa’s brother and a part of Rāvaṇa’s kingdom. The demons had brought Rāmacandra there to kill. They wanted Him to lean His head over, and when He would do so, they were going to cut off His head. But Rāmacandra told the demoniac soldiers, “I don’t know what you mean. You’ll have to show Me.” So they all bent their heads over, and He immediately cut off their heads. Prabhupāda said this all happened in Brazil.\nMoving further into the park, Prabhupāda suddenly heard the loud screeching of birds. “Why they are angry?” he asked. Śrutakīrti replied, “They’re in a cage.” “Only birds?” asked Prabhupāda. The local devotees replied that it was a whole zoo.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He has a question that in Latin America there is much belief or superstition in a so-called lost city of Atlantis. It’s very famous all over the Western world that there was a lost civilization called Atlantis that fell down into the ocean.”\nPrabhupāda simply replied, “Maybe.”\nThey approached a large pool recessed about twenty feet into the ground and surrounded by protective fencing. Inside lay two crocodiles. In this material world, Prabhupāda remarked, the conditioned souls are always found in pairs. As Prabhupāda and the devotees walked up to the rail, one crocodile opened his mouth very wide. Prabhupāda remarked, “Don’t you see? He’s inviting. He’s saying, ‘Just one of you come down here.’ ” Prabhupāda laughed. “He’s inviting us for dinner.”\nWhen a devotee asked if industry and technology could be used in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Prabhupāda said yes, it could continue, but practically it had no real use. He gave the example that a man could sit on the ground just as easily as he could sit on a bench. But to make the bench, so much time had to be spent manufacturing. “If the telephone and telegraph and television are used in propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness,” Prabhupāda said, “then it is all right. But they are not doing that. We are utilizing the modern press facilities for printing Vedic scriptures, but they are utilizing the press for sex literature, birds’ philosophy.”\nOne devotee said that the world was beset with so many problems like overpopulation and food shortage, and he asked for the Kṛṣṇa conscious solution to these problems. “Produce food,” said Prabhupāda. “But you are producing bolts and nuts. So try to eat them. You are producing motor tires and bolts, so eat them.” When Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja translated this phrase, the Caracas devotees laughed heartily. To them it seemed especially appropriate, since they knew Caracas as a town polluted by the automobile industry. “The energy is spoiled,” Prabhupāda said. “Everyone is engaged in manufacturing motor parts.”\nThe devotees on the walk were particularly concerned with world problems, and they asked Prabhupāda how a Kṛṣṇa conscious devotee approached the problem of food shortage.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja suggested, “Prabhupāda, the food relief program you started in India could also be used in other countries where there are economic problems.”\nPrabhupāda: “Why not? Butprasādam,not ordinary food. From all our centers you can distribute food,prasādam,because thatprasādammeans they will gradually become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise, if you give them ordinary food, they will get strength and they will increase their sex desire, that’s all.”\nSomeone asked what would happen to the geographic features of the earth as the Age of Kali advanced and also what would be the effect of taking oil and gold from the earth.\nPrabhupāda: “I think I have explained this. You have got a short duration of life, say fifty or sixty years, so instead of contemplating what will happen to this world, you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and go back to home, back to Godhead. Don’t consider what will happen to this world. The nature will take care of it. You don’t puzzle your brain with these thoughts. Use whatever time you have got in your possession, and go back to home, back to Godhead. You cannot check it. So the best thing is to mold your life and go back to home, back to Godhead. Fly in your own machine, instead of thinking what will happen. It will happen, because the people will go on with their rascal civilization, and the natural consequences will be there. Better you take advantage of whatever time you have got and become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious and go back to home.”\nEach evening a small group of intellectuals and seekers gathered to talk with Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nThe first evening a professor came. Prabhupāda began saying that people are making a huge, frenzied endeavor just to secure money in the daytime and to have sex and to sleep at night. The professor, speaking through Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja as translator, replied, “I do know that it is not the aim of life just to spend money on your family, go to bed, and have sex. But it is part of life.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda: “That I know also. Everyone knows. But beyond that, there must be some aim of life.”\nProfessor: “But I think there should be some kind of humbleness.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, humbleness is of course a good qualification, but the humbleness you will find in animal also. He is very humble, and if you cut his throat, he will not tell anyone. So humbleness, that is another thing. But what should be the aim of life? What is the actual aim of life? If we forget the aim of life and simply become humble like the ass, is that a very good qualification? The ass is very humble. You load upon it tons of clothes; it will not protest. Very humble.” The professor objected to Prabhupāda’s conclusions. His opinion was that the transcendental search should not be undertaken so wholeheartedly. He felt Prabhupāda was putting himself forward egotistically as a “perfect person” and making claims on blind faith. Śrīla Prabhupāda answered all these objections with reason, argument, and śāstric evidence. But whatever Śrīla Prabhupāda advocated, the professor disliked, and whatever Prabhupāda disliked, the professor would endorse.\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He asked if we are content just to purify ourselves or if we also want to help the society.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, you do not know what is the self, so how will you purify? You do not know what is the self. Can you say what is self?”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “He says it is possible that he could spend his whole life trying to find himself, and at the end of life he might not find himself, but in the meanwhile he will not have helped society.”\nPrabhupāda: “Not only in one life you will not know yourself but millions of lifetimes you will not be able to know. Unless you change your policy.” Although it seemed futile, Prabhupāda continued to offer the man spiritual life, defeating his speculative notions and giving him sound arguments for the necessity of self-realization. Prabhupāda’s disciples had presented the professor for an evening of discourse, and so Śrīla Prabhupāda gave the professor what he gave everyone – the opportunity to hear about the Absolute Truth from a pure devotee. Prabhupāda had done the same thing in New York City, in San Francisco, in Calcutta, in Bombay, in Africa, in London – wherever he went and to whomever he met. The professor in Caracas was particularly stubborn, but Prabhupāda was tolerant, answering each argument until the talk grew quite lengthy. “Give himprasādam,” Prabhupāda finally said. The professor departed, smiling. “It was a great pleasure.”\nAnother night, the leaders of the Metaphysical Society of Caracas came.\n“From my point of view,” their leader said, “you are repeating this Hare Kṛṣṇamantraover and over again somewhat like hypnotism. For example, in some tribal rituals they chant different things.”\nPrabhupāda: “That is your opinion. But you are not an authority.” Śrīla Prabhupāda quoted fromBhagavad-gītā,where Kṛṣṇa says that chanting the Lord’s name is the activity of themahātmās,or great souls.\n“In the Western Hemisphere,” the man said, “the supreme authority is Saint Germain. And he says we should chant ‘I am.’ That is a quote from the Bible. Apparently, when they asked God who He is, God said, ‘I am that I am.’ ”\nPrabhupāda replied that “I am” is not itself the name of God. Moreover, no one can claim to be God also, simply by saying “I am.”\nPrabhupāda: “When God says ‘I am’ and I say ‘I am,’ there is a difference. I am particle ‘I am,’ and He is whole ‘I am.’ A millionaire says ‘I am,’ and his servant says ‘I am.’ But what are they saying? For the soul it is all right to say ‘I am,’ but there is a difference between the particle and the whole. That is to be understood. When God says ‘I am,’ that meansI am the whole.And when I say ‘I am,’ that meansI am the particle.Therefore we should understand that when I say ‘I am’ and when God says ‘I am,’ they are different.”\nThe Metaphysical Society leader persisted. “When I say ‘I am,’ ” the man replied, “I don’t mean in the sense of the lower self but in the higher self. I understand that the essence of everyone is the same.”\nPrabhupāda: “That we admitted. God is spirit and I am spirit – both of them ‘I.’ But God’s power and your power are not equal. In the Bible God said, ‘Let there be creation,’ and there was creation. But if you say, ‘Let there becapātī,’ there will be nocapātīunless you work. You have to work for it.”\nThe members of the Metaphysical Society couldn’t accept the worshipable chanting of the names of Kṛṣṇa. “I always understood from Indian philosophy,” the leader said, “that you cannot give God a name because that would be limiting Him.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, we don’t give God a name. But God is named by His actions. Just likeKṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇameans ‘all-attractive.’ That is the quality of God, that He is all-attractive. Similarly,Allahmeans ‘the great.’ So God is great; therefore He is called Allah. So actually God has no name, but according to His actions He has names.”\nAnother night the psychiatrists came. They also disagreed with Prabhupāda. They thought he was claiming too much and criticizing too much.\nPrabhupāda explained, “Mental disease is there basically because he is thinking he is the body.” He gave the example of the driver and the car. If a man identifies with the damage done to his car, then that is a mental disease. The man is actually different from his car, but he thinks that he has become damaged by the damage of the car. “So if the psychiatrist informs him, ‘Why are you sorry? You are not the car,’ then the man is cured. So the defect of modern civilization is that he is not this body, but he does not know it.”\nThe psychiatrists objected, arguing that even if a doctor was looking for God, that did not mean he should stop trying to cure his patients’ physical ailments with psychiatry.\n“No, no,” Prabhupāda corrected, “it is not that I am talking of God. I am talking of the constitutional position of the living being.” Although Śrīla Prabhupāda repeatedly hammered out the example of the driver and the car, the psychiatrists kept insisting, in effect, that it was the car that was important. “But,” Prabhupāda insisted, “the insanity is not of the car. The insanity is of the driver. So when we feel the problems of humanity, it means the insanity of the soul, not of the body.” To this the psychiatrists replied that Prabhupāda’s points were in common with many philosophies. They said there were many different ways and different philosophies for passing the time of this temporary life.\nPrabhupāda: “So you are interested only in the temporary life, never mind there may be disaster.” The psychiatrists insisted that both body and spirit were important. As for the body, they felt responsibility for curing it through psychiatry; as for the soul, that was a speculative field in which one person’s opinion was as good as another. Finally, after repeated attempts, Prabhupāda made them admit the simplest truth.\nPrabhupāda: “Just like the dead body. Everything is present in the dead body. The machine is there. Now somehow or other you try to drive it. But you cannot.”\nPsychiatrist (translated through Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja): “The body cannot be driven because the spirit is gone. I admit that.”\nPrabhupāda: “That means the driver is gone. So who is important, the body or the driver?”\nPsychiatrist: “Both are important.”\nPrabhupāda: “Both are there, but comparatively which is more important?”\nPsychiatrist: “The spirit is.”\nBut then a woman psychiatrist spoke, suggesting that Śrīla Prabhupāda was being overly critical of society, without a specific solution. Again Śrīla Prabhupāda referred to the car and the driver. When Prabhupāda said that no educational department was giving clear information of the prime factor, the car’s driver, she said he was a radical, because many groups were doing just that, and she herself had studied theology for two years in college.\nAs on previous nights, the talk was tense, the guests unyielding in their refusal to accept the most elementary aspects of transcendental science. Śrīla Prabhupāda was offering them instruction in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but he would not compromise.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda intended to initiate many Venezuelan devotees, but there was a controversy over who was eligible. Those first initiates who had been in the movement for a year were expectingbrāhmaṇainitiation from him during his visit. But after the candidates had failed both a written and an oral exam on Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy, the temple leaders decided the devotees weren’t qualified for second initiation at this time.\nWhen a lively discussion of the upcoming initiations occurred outside Prabhupāda’s door, Prabhupāda came out into the hall. The devotees explained the situation, and he asked the temple president the devotees’ qualifications.\n“Well, Prabhupāda, they go out onsaṅkīrtanaevery day.”\n“Then why don’t you give them your mercy?” Prabhupāda said. Prabhupāda was teaching his leaders what it meant. It didn’t mean being lenient or slack or allowing a devotee to break the rules and say it was all right. But it meant seeing the good the devotees were doing. Prabhupāda said that in Kali-yuga if you see a spark of inclination to spiritual life in someone, then you have to fan it. And it is not sufficient either just to turn that spark into a small flame, but the devotee has to keep working with the conditioned soul until the flame is strong and going on its own.\nPrabhupāda could understand that the devotees wanted to be initiated in his personal presence. It was not expected that he would come back. So he had asked that they be given mercy. They were distributing his books every day onsaṅkīrtana,therefore they were extensions of their magnanimous spiritual master. So why not give them mercy?\nAnother controversy arose over the candidates forsannyāsa.This time Śrīla Prabhupāda took the conservative position. Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja introduced Jagajīvana and Mahāvīra to Śrīla Prabhupāda as candidates for taking the renounced order.\nJagajīvana:Śrīla Prabhupāda began methodically to defeat all our arguments. He gave the argument that Lord Caitanya saidsannyāsawas not recommended in this age. I said, “But Prabhupāda, you said in your books that that applies to Māyāvādīsannyāsa.” Prabhupāda’s main argument was, “If you don’t have to take the risk, why take it?” He gave the names ofsannyāsīswho had fallen down. The devotee with me then presented the argument that Lord Caitanya had takensannyāsain order to help the people, so that they would respect Him. On hearing that, Śrīla Prabhupāda turned to Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja and laughed slightly. “All he wants is fame,” he said. “He’s interested only in fame.” By this time I had forgotten that I even wanted to takesannyāsa.I was completely satisfied just being there with Śrīla Prabhupāda, and I said to him in a fit of devotion, “Actually, I wanted to takesannyāsa,but if I could just be your servant, this is enough.”\nIn his initiation lecture, Prabhupāda stressedśravaṇam,or hearing about Kṛṣṇa, as the most important item in devotional service.\n“All these devotees present here,” he said, “they are not Indians. I have not brought them from India, neither have I bribed them. But by hearing only, they are now coming to God consciousness and becoming devotees. Therefore thisśravaṇam,or hearing, is very, very important. So all of you ladies and gentlemen present here, take advantage of hearing about God from this institution, and you also will become God conscious.” Prabhupāda compared Kṛṣṇa to fire. To enter that state of fire one needs a high temperature, he said. One can transform wood into fire, but if he throws water on the wood, then he cannot ignite it nicely. Prabhupāda compared sinful activities to wet wood; they prevent one from entering the fire of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. “Those who are habituated to all these sins,” Prabhupāda said, “namely illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling – to give up these habits may be a little painful in the beginning. But if you practice and pray to Kṛṣṇa, He will help. It is not difficult to give up these habits. As soon as you give up this wetting process, this sinful life, then immediately you become fifty percent purified to approach God. Then by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇamantrayou make further, further, more, more progress. And when you are completely free from all sinful reaction, then you will understand God and love Him.”\nOne evening Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja entered Śrīla Prabhupāda’s room and found him alone, carefully reading the Spanish edition of theKṛṣṇabook,Kṛṣṇa, La Suprema Personalidad de Dios.“Śrīla Prabhupāda!” Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja exclaimed. “You are reading in Spanish!” Prabhupāda smiled and said, “For Kṛṣṇa you can do anything.”\nHṛdayānanda Mahārāja: “She says that at the temple there is muchmāyāand that the people who live in the temple are faulty.”\nPrabhupāda: “And where there is nomāyā? Tell me a place where there is nomāyā;we shall go there. No, in the temple there is nomāyā.Because I am inmāyā,I am thinking the temple ismāyā.Let us consider theBhagavad-gītā:mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.‘For anyone who surrenders to Me, he overcomes the influence ofmāyā.’ Therefore, those who are living in the temple are not inmāyā.”\n“So I thank you very much for your kindly receiving me in this temple, and I was very happy. My request is that you continue your devotional service very faithfully and rigidly. Then in this life you will be able to see Kṛṣṇa face to face; that is a fact. So you follow the advice as given by Rūpa Gosvāmī.Utsāha.The first thing is enthusiasm that ‘I must see Kṛṣṇa.’ You are seeing Kṛṣṇa. The Deity of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa are not different. But even personally you can see, simply we have to continue the enthusiasm. Enthusiasm means to take things very seriously –utsāhāt,dhairyāt –and patiently. We are determined to go back to home, back to Godhead, so we should patiently follow the rules and regulations.\n“So these are the six principles. Enthusiasm and firm determination and patience and executing the regulative principles.Tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.Andsato vṛtteḥmeans behavior must be very honestly, no hypocrisy.Tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt, sādhu-saṅga.And in the association of devotees. If you follow these six principles – namely enthusiasm, determination, patience, and executing the regulative principles, and keep yourself honest and in the association of devotees – if you follow these six principles, then your success is sure.\n“So these are the six positive principles,ṣaḍbhir bhaktiḥ prasidhyati.By following these six principles, success is assured. Similarly, there are opposite number. What is that?Atyāhāra,eating too much.Atyāhāra, prayāsa – prajalpa,talking nonsense, gossiping some subject matter which has no concern with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are accustomed to do that; we should avoid it.Atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ. Niyamāgrahameans simply make a show of the rules and regulations but not actually realize them. Andlaulyam,to become very greedy, andjana-saṅgaś ca,mixing with persons who are not devotees.\n“These six things should be avoided, and the first things should be followed, then your success in devotional service is sure.Prajalpa,unnecessary gossiping. Just like people are wasting time taking one newspaper and talking for hours. These things should be avoided. And to associate with nondevotees, and greediness – these things should be avoided.Atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca prajalpo niyamāgṛhaḥ / jana-saṅgaś ca laulyaṁ ca ṣaḍbhir bhaktir vinaśyati.If you indulge in these six items, then your devotional service will be finished. And the first six principles meansutsāhād niścayād dhairyāt tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt / sādhu-saṅgāt sato vṛtteḥ ṣaḍbhir bhaktiḥ prasidhyati.By these six principles you will advance, and by the other six principles you will fall down.\n“So under the guidance of your leaders in this temple, especially Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, you follow. One life just take a little trouble. It is not trouble, it is very happy life. But because we are accustomed to these material habits, we think it is trouble. No, it is not trouble. It is very pleasing.Susukhaṁ kartum avyayam. To execute devotional service is very pleasing. Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.”\nMiamiFebruary 25, 1975The Miami temple was located on two and a half acres in suburban Coconut Grove. On the property were several large banyan trees, and flowers and tropical vines grew along the fencing surrounding the property. To Śrīla Prabhupāda the climate was similar to India.\nAs he was entering the temple room on his arrival, Prabhupāda noticed an adjoining room housingtulasīplants, and he entered. Śrīla Prabhupāda smiled to see the room crowded with very healthytulasīsin large pots. He then entered the temple room. Once again Śrīla Prabhupāda beheld Gaura-Nitāi as the worshipable Deity. He had just come from Caracas, where the same two transcendental brothers were the presidingarcā-vigrahaincarnations. It was midafternoon, and Śrīla Prabhupāda sat on thevyāsāsanaand addressed the twenty or so devotees who had gathered in Miami for his arrival.\n“It is a great fortune for you,” Śrīla Prabhupāda began. “Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared for delivering all kinds of fallen souls in this age. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings,pāpī tāpī jata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo, tāra sākṣī jagāi mādhāi.So,brajendra-nandana yei, śacī-suta hoilo sei, balarāma hoilo nitāi.The same Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Kṛṣṇa has appeared as the son of mother Śacī, and Balarāma has appeared as Nityānanda. Their business is to deliver all fallen souls, especially in this age, Kali-yuga. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mission was that He should be present by His name, by His form, by His pastimes, in every town and village of the world. And you are fulfilling His mission. So undoubtedly you will be blessed, and you will get Kṛṣṇa’s mercy through the mercy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. To understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy thing.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda emphasized the difficulty of attaining spiritual knowledge in the material world. Recalling a recent talk with a psychiatrist in Caracas, he told how the man had adamantly refused to understand the existence of the soul. So the devotees were fortunate.\n“Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu,” Prabhupāda continued, speaking slowly, “out of His great compassion for the fallen souls, He appeared. Kṛṣṇa comes also. But Kṛṣṇa is not so liberal. Kṛṣṇa makes conditions that ‘First of all you surrender, then I take charge of you.’ But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is more compassionate than Kṛṣṇa, although Kṛṣṇa and Caitanya Mahāprabhu are the same thing. By Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy we are so easily understanding Kṛṣṇa. That Caitanya Mahāprabhu is present here. You worship Him. It is not very difficult.Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ. Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam / yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana.You simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇamantra,and whatever you can, offer Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He is very kind. He does not take offense. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa worship is a little difficult. We have to worship with great awe and veneration. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu has voluntarily come to deliver the fallen souls.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda continued explaining the mercy of Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya does not accept any offense from His worshipers, and He is pleased just by your dancing and chanting, the easiest process for God realization.\n“So as far as possible,” Prabhupāda requested, “if possible twenty-four hours – if that is not possible, at least four times, six times – chant the Hare Kṛṣṇamantrabefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and you will get success in your life. So I am very glad that you are worshiping Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu. So continue to do this. There is no need of installing Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, at least at the present moment. When you become more advanced in spiritual consciousness, then you can establish. But even if you do not establish, it does not matter. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is sufficient.Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya.Caitanya Mahāprabhu is combination of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. In one place you worship Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. So I see this place is very nice, and you are also very nice. Take advantage of this opportunity and go on chanting Hare Kṛṣṇamantraand worship Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He will bless you sufficiently to become successful in getting shelter at the lotus feet of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda stayed in the house next door to the temple, in several rooms prepared for him. In the living room an altar was set up, and to the right and left of the altar were pottedtulasīplants in white straw baskets. On the wall hung a large poster of Lord Kṛṣṇa speaking to the despondent Arjuna.\nTraveling such a great distance from South America to leave again after a day or two was a real test whether Prabhupāda could follow his usual schedule while in Miami. But he did. As usual, he took rest that evening and rose about 1:00 A.M., translating and commenting onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamin the same room he had slept in. Wherever he was, Śrīla Prabhupāda was always steady – with Kṛṣṇa. As he had once commented, “No place is my home. My home is at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.”\nPutting aside his books, Prabhupāda took hisjapabeads and in the still pre-dawn began chanting, pacing back and forth in his room. Śrutakīrti, who had returned as Prabhupāda’s servant, entered, made obeisances, and performed some duties in Prabhupāda’s room. While chanting, Śrīla Prabhupāda gazed at the picture of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. Suddenly he smiled and said, “I like this picture very much. It is very instructive.”\n“What is that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?” his servant asked.\n“Kṛṣṇa is saying,” Śrīla Prabhupāda explained, “ ‘You have to give up everything. Very difficult job. You have to kill your family members.’ Arjuna couldn’t do it, but he had to do it because it was Kṛṣṇa’s order.Thatiskṛṣṇa-bhajana.One has to be ready to give up everything and do what Kṛṣṇa wants.”\nDawn arrived, but the skies remained gray. Prabhupāda went by car to a secluded section of Miami Beach and walked along the shore. He wore a woolcādaraagainst the slight chilliness in the air.\nSureśvara:We were walking right along the edge of the water, and the water would come up, and Prabhupāda’s cane would touch just beyond where the water reached. His cane would make little holes in the sand. Someone would ask a question, mostly Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja, and Prabhupāda would sometimes stop walking to answer it. At one point on the walk when Prabhupāda stopped to answer a question, I stopped right in back of him. We would all walk with him, and the positions of the people would change just by the nature of our walking. At one point when he stopped, I was right in back of him, behind his head, and as he answered the question he turned and faced me. I suddenly had an intense understanding that even though I was next to Prabhupāda physically, actually I was a million miles away from him because my consciousness was so un–Kṛṣṇa conscious.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda wanted to see the temple room and the grounds. But when he walked into the yard and saw it covered with leaves from the various trees, he showed his displeasure. He reprimanded the temple president, Abhirāma, saying that the grounds should always be kept clean and the leaves raked. Actually, because the yard had no grass, the devotees had carefully gathered leaves and spread them out evenly all over the yard, thinking they would be like a soft carpet for Śrīla Prabhupāda. They imagined he would like to walk on it when he went to thevyāsāsanathey had set up for him outdoors under the banyan tree. But Prabhupāda criticized the dirty, unkempt appearance. This was Kṛṣṇa’s property, he said, and should not be neglected. “Look at the neighbors’ yards,” he pointed out. “Their yards are clean. Why do you have leaves on the ground?” Abhirāma made an excuse. “Under the leaves,” he said, “there is only dirt. So we thought the leaves would keep the dust from rising.”\nPrabhupāda replied sharply, “There are nicelawnseverywhere. Why here you have dirt? Why?”\nAnother Miami devotee made the mistake of replying, “Prabhupāda, there’s no one to do it.” Śrīla Prabhupāda looked around at the twenty people following him. “How is this? No one to do it?” He refused to speak in the backyard until they cleared away the leaves. And so, while Prabhupāda went to his room, the devotees began to remove the carefully placed “carpet” that they now saw as piles of dirty, insect-infested leaves.\nFor breakfast Śrīla Prabhupāda took the juice of local coconuts, which were golden colored, and found it delicious. He also took his favorite fruit, mango, which grew abundantly there. His class was in the evening, and so he took time in the morning to speak with Abhirāma. Abhirāma presented an idea of forming a farm community in Florida. He told Śrīla Prabhupāda about Disney World in Orlando, wheremāyāwas presented expertly.\n“We should also have a place like that,” Prabhupāda replied. “It should be called Vaikuṇṭha World.” A farm community, Prabhupāda said, should be according tovarṇāśrama,and everyone should be engaged according to his propensity and occupation.\nThe evening class was a treat. It was cool, about seventy degrees, compared to the oppressive heat of the day. The setting was dramatic. Spotlights shone on Śrīla Prabhupāda as he sat on avyāsāsanaunder the banyan tree, while guests and disciples sat around his feet. Prabhupāda chose to speak on the first verse of the Thirteenth Chapter ofBhagavad-gītā.Although he lectured regularly onBhagavad-gītāas he traveled, he did not use consecutive verses from city to city. In each city, he would open the book at a different place and begin from there.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda had repeatedly taught that the basis ofBhagavad-gītāand of all spiritual life is to hear submissively from the spiritual master. “Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching people how to become submissive to the authority.” Again he recalled the psychiatrist who visited him in Caracas. The man’s arrogant unsubmissiveness had made an impression on Prabhupāda; even so-called educated men were too proud to submit themselves to absolute authority.\n“This psychiatrist’s question was,” Prabhupāda said to his audience in Miami, “ ‘The problems of the world are increasing, so what is your prescription to solve these problems?’ So the problem is very easy to be solved. I gave the example that the body is here, and there is something which is moving the body, the living force. So that living force is the driver of the body, and also the body is described in theBhagavad-gītāas a machine.”\nPrabhupāda explained theBhagavad-gītāverse, commenting that real knowledge was to know the difference between the self and the body. To manufacture a nice car or machine was not education.\n“In India,” Prabhupāda said, “he who knows how to join wires and bring current like an electrician is called amistrī. Mistrīmeans ‘worker.’ But that does not mean he is educated. Education is a different thing. But at the present moment the education is technical. Formerly this technical education was entrusted to the demons. Formerly they also manufactured big, big airplanes, but that was being done by the demons – not by the great saintly persons or sages, no. That was being done by the demons. Theyogīscould also produce wonderful things by their yogic mystic power. That was another thing. But generally, where there was a question of manufacturing, that was being done by the demons. Education, however, meansbrahma-vidyā,to understand what is the living force within the body – What is his constitutional position? How is it working? Wherefrom it has come?”\nOn the second night Prabhupāda lectured again. Each talk was lengthy, and he answered all questions. As the last question on the last evening in Miami, one of the devotees asked, “Śrīla Prabhupāda, if someone takesprasādameven once, is it true that they are guaranteed at least a human body in their next life?”\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda replied. “You go on simply eating, that’s all. And all of my devotees, they have come to me simply by eatingprasādam.” As he said this, Prabhupāda was beaming, smiling, looking all around. When his glance fell on Abhirāma, the temple president, who sat beside him, Prabhupāda said, “You, too, Abhirāma?” Abhirāma looked sheepish and said, “Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.” Prabhupāda made other devotees admit their attraction forkṛṣṇa-prasādam.“You also?” he asked one after another. “You also?” Everyone admitted, until the audience was thrown into laughter and appreciation ofprasādam.\n“Yes,” Prabhupāda continued in good humor. “So we give all facilities. If you cannot do anything, please come and eat with us. All right, thank you very much.”\nAtlantaFebruary 28–March 2, 1975The Deities of Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda Prabhu in Atlanta are over four feet tall and effulgent. Their lotus feet are usually fully visible, transcendentally poised atop the whorls of lotus flowers. Their arms are upraised about Their heads, and They urge everyone to dance and taste the nectar of the holy names of Kṛṣṇa. Their faces show mild, compassionate smiles. And the mode of worship of God They are delivering, as described by Śrīla Prabhupāda, is very, very lenient and easy to perform for the unfortunate people of the present age.\nOn his arrival within the Atlanta temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda was very moved to see Gaura-Nitāi. Now in three consecutive stops he had entered each ISKCON temple for the first time and taken thedarśanaof Gaura-Nitāi. This time, as in Caracas, it overwhelmed him.\nAbout three hundred superenthusiastic devotees had gathered to meet him. Aside from the residential devotees of the Atlanta temple, some fortybrahmacārīsfrom Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami’s Rādhā-Dāmodara bus parties, about a dozenbrahmacārīsfrom Satsvarūpa Mahārāja’s traveling library party, about a dozen men from Tripurāri’s airport book distribution party, the devotee-scientists of Svarūpa Dāmodara’s Bhaktivedanta Institute group, and other visitors were present. They had greeted Prabhupāda outside the building as he had pulled up in a black Lincoln, and now they followed him with an uproariouskīrtanainto the temple room within the large house that served as the Atlanta temple.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda stood before the Deities. The ceiling and walls of the Deity room were mirrored and produced an unusual effect, multiplying the images of the Gaura-Nitāi Deities. Prabhupāda approved of it. He then walked from the front altar to hisvyāsāsana,glancing upon the devotees as they parted their tight ranks and allowed him to pass. He sat upon thevyāsāsana,facing the devotees, who quickly hushed into silence.\n“So I am very glad to see you,” Śrīla Prabhupāda began. “I am coming first of all from Mexico City, then Caracas, then Miami. I see your temple is the best.” At this, the assembled devotees, especially the Atlanta devotees, burst into loud, unrestrained cheers and cries of “Jaya!” “Haribol!”\n“So Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very kind,” Śrīla Prabhupāda continued.“Parama karuṇa, pahū dui jana.Two Lords, Nitāi-Gauracandra, Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, They are very kind, you see. They have appeared just to reclaim the fallen souls of this age. So They are more kind than Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, He is also very kind. He comes to deliver, but Kṛṣṇa demands, ‘First of all surrender.’ But Caitanya Mahāprabhu does not demand.” At this point, Śrīla Prabhupāda became overwhelmed with transcendental emotion. He tried to speak. He uttered, “He is so kind,” but then his voice broke, and he began to shed tears. He spoke on, but his voice became very high as he was gripped by an ecstasy that made him helpless and inconceivably humble. “So take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu,” he cried out, “and be happy. Thank you very much.” And then he stopped, unable to say more. The devotees themselves felt carried away and cried out, “Haribol!” in loud unison. Then, as if commanded, they all bowed down and uttered obeisances, “Nama oṁ viṣṇu-padāya. …”Śrīla Prabhupāda’s arrival address was thus completed in two minutes, and he motioned to his servant that he wanted to go. The devotees were stunned at his brief, powerful entry.\nThat same evening Prabhupāda came down again from his room. Again he sat on hisvyāsāsanaand said he would teach a song, “Parama Karuṇa.” He started chanting slowly with hiskaratālas,and the devotees tried to follow, although few knew the song.\nAfter a few moments, he asked devotees to play along with him onmṛdaṅga.A few tried, but no one seemed able to find the right beat. Śrīla Prabhupāda then stopped them and said he would show the right drum pattern. He had a devotee rewind the tape recorder that had just recorded Prabhupāda playingkaratālasand chanting, so that he could accompany himself. The devotees were especially surprised, since no one could remember exactly how long it had been since he had played themṛdaṅga.The devotees produced one oldmṛdaṅga,but it sounded dead. A second drum was passed forward, but it was also dead. Then a boy offered his personal drum, amṛdaṅgacovered with a bright red and gold cloth. Śrīla Prabhupāda placed it on his lap, tested it, and found it acceptable. He then began to play, while devotees taped a complete recording of Prabhupāda playingkaratālas, mṛdaṅga,and singing. In another unusual touch, Śrīla Prabhupāda had put on his glasses, adding an air of studious concentration to his playing and singing.\nWhen Prabhupāda finished singing, he explained. “Pahūmeansprabhu.A shortcut ofprabhuispahū. Prabhumeans ‘lord’ or ‘master.’ So these two Prabhus are Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is addressed as Mahāprabhu, and others are addressed as Prabhu. So these two Prabhus, Nityānanda Prabhu and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, are very merciful.” It was as if Śrīla Prabhupāda was giving a purport to the uncontrollable ecstasy that overcame him earlier when he was unable to speak.\n“Parama karuṇameans ‘extremely merciful,’ ” Prabhupāda explained. “Extremely merciful because Kṛṣṇa is also merciful, since He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original feature. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is also Kṛṣṇa, but He is acting as devotee. He is not acting as Kṛṣṇa. He is acting as devotee of Kṛṣṇa.Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te / kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda then quoted the verse by Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya further describing the mercy of Lord Caitanya. “Lord Caitanya has come to teach us because we are all in the bodily concept of life. He has come to teach us detachment and devotional service to Kṛṣṇa.” Prabhupāda recited another verse, the one Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered to Rāmānanda Rāya as the perfection of religion. That verse beginsjñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva.“Themeaning,” Śrīla Prabhupāda explained, “is that one should give up other processes and just hear about Kṛṣṇa. And to hear about Him you do not require to change your position.Sthāne sthitāḥ.You are scientist, that is all right. You are lawyer, that’s all right. You are fool, that’s all right … But you do one thing. You use your ear and hear from the realized soul.” In his explanation, Śrīla Prabhupāda told of different events from the life of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. “That Caitanya Mahāprabhu has come here in Atlanta,” he concluded. “So you worship this Caitanya Mahāprabhu.Parama karuṇa, pahū dui jana.They are very, very merciful. A little service will enhance your devotional service to a larger scale.”\nTripurāri: “Śrīla Prabhupāda, sometimes when we give someone a book, he says, ‘I would never read it.’ ”\nPrabhupāda chuckled. “You ask him, ‘So you want to remainmūḍha?’ ”\nTripurāri: “We say, ‘No, take it home, and some day you will read it.’ But they think they can find out on their own.”\nPrabhupāda: “That is foolishness. They cannot.Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.”\nAs they walked, Prabhupāda noticed a big sign by the lake marked “No swimming.” “Oh,” Prabhupāda remarked, “who is going to swim now?” The devotees laughed, a comic relief to their shivering.\nTripurāri: “Once Balavanta was very sick when he was dealing with politicians, and I heard that you said that it was because by touching them and associating with them he accepted some of their sinful reactions.”\nPrabhupāda chuckled again. “I did not say. But it may be.”\nTripurāri: “So I was wondering, sometimes our men onsaṅkīrtanaare shaking hands – ”\nPrabhupāda: “If you are onsaṅkīrtana,you cannot be infected. If somebody is infected, then preaching will stop. If a doctor is infected, then treatment will stop. But the doctor is never infected. They have good precautions. Similarly, when you are engaged insaṅkīrtana, māyācannot touch.Māyām etāṁ taranti te.”\nOne of the devotees from the library party spoke up and told some of their experiences in dealing with professors.\nDevotee: “When we take your books out on the library party to the professors, they say that they are very surprised that one person has written so many books.”\n“So I am also surprised,” Prabhupāda said, “how I have written so many, what to speak of them. It is all Kṛṣṇa’s mercy.”\nDevotee: “One professor the other day was saying just like a devotee that you were coming in disciplic succession and were authorized to translate all these books.”\n“Yes, that is right,” Prabhupāda agreed. “In fact, that authority I have got. I was explaining last evening, Don’t speculate. That is the qualification. All others, they are simply speculating.” For most of the devotees on the walk that morning, it was the first time they had ever been able to approach Śrīla Prabhupāda in person. They had been dedicatedly serving him day and night for years, and this was the chance of a lifetime. In some cases, the questions they asked were calculated to wash away all their doubts and would be the basis of their entire devotional strength in the future. In this mood one of the library party distributors, Mahābuddhi, moved in close beside Prabhupāda.\n“Śrīla Prabhupāda,” Mahābuddhi said, “in my service I have to always meet many educated people, much more educated than I am. So we are trying to present the philosophy, but I’m not so inclined to study all your books. I’m just not scholarly inclined.”\nPrabhupāda laughed and replied, “Just pray to Kṛṣṇa then.Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam. …Pray like this to Kṛṣṇa every day. ‘My dear Kṛṣṇa, please give me the intelligence so that I may be able to become empowered.’ ”\nIn a meeting with these disciple-scientists, Śrīla Prabhupāda expressed his intense desire to see Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy defeat the bombastic claims of science that life occurs by chance or from matter. “These people have no common sense,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said. “And they all pass as scientists. That we must protest, because we are servants of God. We are not servants of scientists. Call them directly ‘rascal.’ We are not a scientist, but we speak from common sense. That’s all. So many people are being misled by these scientists and politicians.”\nŚrīla Prabhupāda commented that the creation is already created, and therefore the scientists should get no credit in their latest attempts to imitate the creation with their “test tube babies.”\n“We have got the test tube – ” Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “Bhagavad-gītā.As soon as you see a man who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, all right, then he is amūḍha.That’s all.”\nLike the book distributors, Svarūpa Dāmodara and his scientist-Godbrothers questioned Prabhupāda to their hearts’ content, and with great enthusiasm he urged them to answer as he was doing and “expose the rascals.”\nOn the same day, in the presence of his scientist-disciples, Śrīla Prabhupāda met with an Indian scientist who was a specialist in nutrition. The man explained that his work benefited mankind by finding the cause of and treating protein deficiencies. Śrīla Prabhupāda replied, “Suppose the birds and beasts have no research institute. Yet there is sufficient protein supplied by nature. An elephant has got a big body and so much strength, but they have not found that by your scientific research. The nature is supplying.Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ.It is being done. Why you are wasting time in this way? You study what isprakṛtiand what is behindprakṛti.That is real study. The protein supply is already being done. Just like a cow is eating grass. And she is supplying milk, full of protein. So do you think that the protein is coming from the grass? Can you eat grass?”\nScientist: “Something must be – ”\nPrabhupāda: “That issomething,that is not perfect knowledge. Everyone knows the cow does not take any protein food. She takes on the grass.”\nScientist: “Grass is quite rich in protein.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then you take. Why are you searching after protein?”\nScientist: “Because we cannot digest the fiber in it.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then it is not suitable for you. Therefore nature’s arrangement is that protein can be produced through the body of the cow.”\nScientist: “I think, Swamiji, nature’s arrangement was not made for that many human beings as we have now on the earth.”\nPrabhupāda: “Nature was defective, you mean to say?”\nScientist: “No, sir.”\nPrabhupāda: “Then?”\nScientist: “I mean nature’s way is designed that the ecological balance of the …”\nAnd so it went. When the Indian scientist said that the flesh of the cow was valuable for its protein, Prabhupāda became disgusted. “But however much protein you may accumulate,” Prabhupāda challenged, “can you stop your death?”\nAfter debating some forty minutes with the Indian scientist, the devotees abruptly brought a professor of religion from Emory University into the room. It was simply one meeting after another for Śrīla Prabhupāda. The devotees were perhaps not completely aware that they were, in effect, asking Śrīla Prabhupāda to talk nonstop all day. But he did not complain. He immediately asked the professor, “What is your definition of religion?” And then in the silence Prabhupāda launched into a definitive discussion of God consciousness according toŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nAlong with the professor had come several Orthodox Christians. In the course of the discussion, one of them said to Śrīla Prabhupāda, “God is my life. Without Him I cannot live. I understand what you are saying, but I believe that our tradition from the Old Testament says that we werecreatedby God.” Śrīla Prabhupāda had been explaining that the living entity is never created but is eternal, just like God.\nPrabhupāda: “Yes, in one sense we are created. Just like the father creates the sons. It is not that the sons create the father. In that sense we are created. So taking this word, the sons are created; therefore the father existed before our creation.”\nThe Orthodox Christian respected Prabhupāda’s explanation and seemed to sense that behind the apparent differences, Prabhupāda, like he, was a follower of God.\n“It’s a mystery,” the Christian said reverently. “We can only bow down before Him then.”\n“That is our business,” Prabhupāda said. Prabhupāda had recognized God’s ultimately inconceivable nature in such a simple but sublime way by saying, “That is our business” that everyone in the room laughed in appreciation – both at the inconceivable nature of God and at the magical moment created before their eyes by God’s pure devotee, Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n“Maybe I should perform theārati,” he said to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja. “I should do it.”\n“All the devotees think so, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They would be very happy if you did.”\n“Yes, I will do it.” So Śrīla Prabhupāda performed another rarely seen activity in Atlanta, as he offered each article, the ghee wick flame, the water and the conchshell, and so on, before the picture of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.\nThat morning Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke about serving the spiritual master in separation. “You should always pray,” Prabhupāda said, “that only by the grace of the spiritual master we achieve the grace or mercy of Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of Vyāsa-pūjā. As far as possible we have tried to give you instruction, books. But remain always faithful to the spiritual master and try to understand Kṛṣṇa. Any other so-called understanding is simply a waste of time.”\nTripurāri: “We have been trying harder and harder, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to make our techniques of distribution more honest and to be straightforward and not to cheat so much as some of the methods in the past.”\nPrabhupāda: “No, the thing is that Kṛṣṇa’s service is so sublime that even if we cheat, we are not culprit. But because we have to deal with the worldly men, we have to go according to their rules and regulations on cheating. Otherwise, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he never cheats. He never cheats, whatever he does. The mother says to the child, ‘My dear child, if you take this medicine I will give you thislaḍḍu.’ The child is deviated. He is not able to digest thelaḍḍu,but the mother sometimes cheats, and when he takes the medicine, thelaḍḍuis not delivered. Similarly, we have to say so many things very pleasing to him. But our business is let him take this medicine. That is our tactic. That is not cheating. If the mother helps the child drinking medicine, then afterwards she does not supply thelaḍḍu,that is not cheating. Somehow or other, that is the instruction of Rūpa Gosvāmī.Tasmāt kenāpy upāyena manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet.Somehow or other let everyone be Kṛṣṇa conscious. The other rules and regulations will act as the servant, but the main business is to bring one to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are not meant for cheating anyone; we have no such business. But to lead one to Kṛṣṇa consciousness we may sometimes say some things, and that is not cheating.”\nTripurāri: “Just by distributing your books we can become self-realized?”\nPrabhupāda: “You are already self-realized. Otherwise how you can push on the books? You love Kṛṣṇa; therefore you are taking so much labor for pushing on. That is self-realization. If anyone tries to establish that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, that is self-realization.”\nTripurāri: “Sometimes the devotees ask if they can take birth again distributing books for you.”\nPrabhupāda: “Very good. That is real devotion. A devotee does not want to go to Vaikuṇṭha or any liberation. They are satisfied with service. That is pure devotion. And distributing books for the benefit of going to Kṛṣṇa, that is selfishness. But I want to simply distribute the books without any remuneration, without any personal desire. That is pure devotee. Prahlāda Mahārāja says, ‘I do not wish to go to Vaikuṇṭha unless I take all these rascals with me.’ That is pure devotee.”\nTamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami:At that time I took the liberty to introduce many devotees from our Rādhā-Dāmodara party to Śrīla Prabhupāda, because I had an intimate relationship with Prabhupāda in India that carried over also in America, and I felt that he would personally want to meet all the devotees on our party. So one by one every devotee from our party – only about half of our party was there, say about forty devotees – was introduced to Prabhupāda. “This person is a mechanic,” I would say, and, “This person is a cook,” or “This person is sewing for the Deities.” In this way Prabhupāda met each devotee, and at the end he said, “Kṛṣṇa has sent you every type of assistant in order to make this program a great success.” Then Prabhupāda proceeded to give a very powerful lecture about remainingbrahmacārī,telling the men, “Why bother to get married? When you get married, your wife will immediately say, ‘Where is the house? Where are the children? Where is the clothing? Where is the food?’ In this way there will be so many problems.” He said it was better to stay simple and remainbrahmacārīand preach Lord Caitanya’s mission.\nAfterwards, the devotees performed a play depicting Lord Caitanya’s civil disobedience movement. In the drama one of thesmārta-brāhmaṇaswas complaining to the Muslim Kazi about the public chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇamantraby Lord Caitanya and His followers. Thebrāhmaṇasaid that the potency of themantrawould be lost by the public chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. Here Śrīla Prabhupāda interrupted the play, exclaiming, “But it has already increased!” When Prabhupāda said that, hundreds of joyous devotees began crying out, “Haribol!” “Jaya!” as a testimony to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s words. By the grace of Śrīla Prabhupāda, the potency of Hare Kṛṣṇa was expanded more and more.\n“So you want to take again election?” Prabhupāda asked, and he chuckled.\n“Not if you don’t want me to, Prabhupāda,” Balavanta replied. “I just take it as an opportunity to preach if you want it. But if you’re not very enthusiastic about it, I don’t want to do it.”\n“No, I am enthusiastic,” Prabhupāda said, “provided you don’t want money.”\n“I think we can get our own. I can get the money. It doesn’t have to cost very much. The whole thing we would need is maybe two men to help. That’s only for two or three months of the year.”\n“Then you can do it,” Prabhupāda concluded. “If it makes you well known in the city, and you get the opportunity of criticizing the demons.”\nBalavanta:When Prabhupāda was leaving at the airport, I was determined to stay with him until the last moment. On the way down the hall he had given me a rose. I followed him all the way onto the plane. I was thinking, “I am going to stand here in my post in front of Prabhupāda’s seat and guard against any demons that disturb Prabhupāda.” I saw how insignificant thekarmīswere in comparison to him. I was thinking that I will not let them interfere with my service of standing in front of Prabhupāda. So I was blocking the aisle, and people were having to squeeze to get around. Prabhupāda sort of chastised me lightly with his eyes, that I should be courteous to people and mindful, not impolite and disturbing. And I noticed that was the way he was. Although when he walked through the airport he dominated the people’s consciousness, he did not try to do that. That happened automatically. When he was on the plane, he was very nicely sitting in his seat in a gentlemanly way, without creating a big disturbance. From his behavior I gathered how the devotees should go through this material world, not trying to cause a big disturbance, not being neglectful of others’ positions, but being respectful and not causing anyone any mental anxiety, living peacefully but taking every opportunity to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in an appropriate way. I could see that here was a representative of God. We have never seen a representative of God before, so immediately it was very important for us to see how he behaved. It was important for everyone to see. But at the same time Prabhupāda was very careful to represent Kṛṣṇa in an appropriate way, because those who don’t recognize him as a representative of God cannot be forced to.\nAfter Atlanta, Śrīla Prabhupāda traveled to Dallas, New York, London, and Tehran, staying only a few days in each place, before flying to Bombay and then on to Calcutta and Māyāpur in time for the annual festival of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s appearance day. After Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s appearance day came the grand opening of the Krishna-Balaram temple in Vṛndāvana, and then Śrīla Prabhupāda set out traveling again on another around-the-worldsaṅkīrtanaorbit.\nŚrīla Prabhupāda himself said that he was an old man, hampered by age, and requiring three assistants to help him move about. But actually he was moving transcendentally; otherwise, how was it possible? His around-the-world journey was not a matter of merely moving over the earth by jet or car. Such a mundane journey many ordinary men can make. But Śrīla Prabhupāda’s journey was one in which the traveler – being a pure devotee – gave pure love of Kṛṣṇa to people everywhere.\nKṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja praises Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in theCaitanya-caritāmṛtafor possessingkṛṣṇa-śakti –the full power of Kṛṣṇa – because He delivered love of Kṛṣṇa all over the world. Śrīla Prabhupāda’s travels around the world similarly establish hiskṛṣṇa-śakti,because wherever he and his movement traveled, the inhabitants took tokali-kālera-dharma,the method of pure religion intended for humanity in the Age of Kali. Inducing sinful people in sinful cultures to take up pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not something an “old man” or a “common man” can do.\nTheśāstrasdescribe the conditioned souls as wandering in the material world, transmigrating from body to body, one after another. In each species they suffer birth, death, disease, and old age. Because there are millions of desires and millions of species of life in which to fulfill those desires, there is little hope that the soul can ever end his journey from one body to another, life after life. Also, because the soul, especially in the human form of life, commits many abominable acts against the will of God, thejīvatakes birth again and again to suffer the reactions for the pains he has caused others. That is the stiff, inflexible law of nature. For killing a cow, for example, a human being must take as many births as there are hairs on the body of that cow and be killed himself in each birth. For committing the sin of abortion one has to be killed within the mother’s womb life after life, again and again. Such acts as animal slaughter and contraception are commonplace in the present age; therefore there is little chance for a person to save himself from the continued repetition of birth, suffering, and death.\nBut Śrīla Prabhupāda’s preaching contained the potency to deliver any sinful person from such perpetual sufferings, and this is the real significance of Prabhupāda’s traveling. Not understanding the facts ofkarmaor the pure devotee’s power to deliver a person fromkarma,people misunderstood Prabhupāda to be, at best, the pious representative of an Indian religion. Kṛṣṇa declares inBhagavad-gītā,“Give up all religion and just surrender to Me. I will release you from the reactions to your sins. Do not worry.” But only by the merciful intervention of the pure devotee does Kṛṣṇa pardon our sins. And because most sinful people are not seeking relief unless the pure devotee comes to deliver them, their lives are hopeless.\nIf externally it appeared that Śrīla Prabhupāda was suffering from old age and from his constant traveling – or if sometimes Śrīla Prabhupāda described himself as an “old man” unfit for such rigorous traveling, then we should take this as a further indication that Śrīla Prabhupāda endured much austerity to carry the message of Kṛṣṇa throughout the world. But internally he was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore he was not disturbed. The order of his spiritual master impelled him to travel.\nAnd his travels bore great fruit, so much so that by 1975 he was traveling not as a lone pioneer but as the founder-ācāryaof a large world religion. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness was being more and more appreciated as the movement of pure devotional service to God, a movement available for men in all religions and lands who hanker for pure worship and pure service unto the Personality of Godhead.\nAs the authorized representative of Lord Caitanya, Śrīla Prabhupāda had a special insight into the great leniency and compassion of Lord Caitanya in delivering the fallen. As stated in theBṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa,“Only by chanting the holy name, only by chanting the holy name, only by chanting the holy name can persons be saved in the Age of Kali. There is no other way.” Śrīla Prabhupāda realized this verse by practical experience, as he saw firsthand the mercy of Lord Caitanya at work. Therefore, when Prabhupāda would arrive at an ISKCON temple and come before Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda who stand on the temple altar, he would sometimes become overwhelmed by the mercy of the Lord and be unable to check his own ecstatic loving emotions. Śrīla Prabhupāda was very dear to Kṛṣṇa, and certainly Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu observed Śrīla Prabhupāda’s preaching and traveling activities – perhaps in the same mood in which He heard the compassionate prayer of Vasudeva Datta. As expressed inCaitanya-caritāmṛta,\nAs Śrīla Prabhupāda has described Vasudeva Datta, who wanted to save all the conditioned souls of the universe, so I would also like to describe Śrīla Prabhupāda, not out of partiality, but on the evidence of Prabhupāda’s life and teachings and on the strength ofśāstra:"
