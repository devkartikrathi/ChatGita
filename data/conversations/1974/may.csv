Girirāja:,Girirāja:Another thing we were discussing yesterday is that inGolokathere are no demons.,Prabhupāda,"No. There cannot be any demons. Then how it isVaikuṇṭha?Vaikuṇṭhameans without any anxiety. So the situation of anxiety is created by the demons. Therefore, whenKṛṣṇawants to fight, He has to come down here because there is no question of fighting. There is no chance of fighting. Everyone is devotee. A devotee will never agree. But they will agree Kṛṣṇa's fight, but here, in this field."
Girirāja:,"Girirāja:But the sentiment of anxiety or fear forKṛṣṇa, is that sentiment inGoloka?",Prabhupāda,"No. There is no such thing. That is separation. Just likegopīs,they are full of anxiety: ""Oh,Kṛṣṇahas gone to the pasturing ground."" Their anxiety is there. Just likeRukmiṇī, she was thinking, ""Oh,Kṛṣṇamay not give me up. He is talking in this way."" She fainted. So anxiety is there. So the anxiety is that one may not be separated fromKṛṣṇa. That is the anxiety. And actually there is no separation, but the feeling of separation out of ecstatic love. Just like one who has got love for the other person, beloved, he always thinks like that, ""My beloved may not be separated from me."" This is ecstasy of love. Just like a miser man who has got much wealth, he always thinks, ""My money may not be lost. My money may not be lost."" Out of his too much attachment for the money, he thinks like that. Is it not? ""How shall I protect this money? How shall I protect this?"" To earn money is also troublesome. To keep money also troublesome. And when it is lost, that is also troublesome. This is the position. But there is no such thing, loss, but the anxiety is there. We shall return from here?

Girirāja:,Girirāja:Is that benefit coming in all suffering or only when it is given byKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. When there is suffering given byKṛṣṇa... Therefore a devotee does not take seriously suffering.Tatte'nukampāṁ susumīkṣamāṇaḥ[SB10.14.8].A devotee thinks, ""It is the favor ofKṛṣṇathat he has put me into suffering."" They never see suffering as suffering. It is favor ofKṛṣṇa. That is devotee's vision. [break] It is exactly like a son who knows his father well. If the father slaps, the son never protests. He knows that ""It is good for me."" Similarly, a devotee is never disturbed when there is suffering given byKṛṣṇa. [break]"
Girirāja:,Girirāja:Akarmīis suffering just the laws of...,Prabhupāda,"Thekarmīis different. Thekarmīis suffering. He is suffering just like criminal is suffering. A criminal is given slap by the police. That slap, and the father is giving slap, that slap is different. Although it looks the same thing, but there is great difference."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:So there is no benefit to suffering unless it is connected withKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. WhenKṛṣṇa... Therefore we shall fully surrender toKṛṣṇa. As Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says,mārobi rākhobi yoicchātohārā:""Now I surrender. Now if you want to maintain me, that is all right, and if You want to kill me, that is also all right."" This is surrender. It is not business, ""If You maintain me, then I surrender. If You kill me, then I do not."" It is not like that.Mārobi rākhobi yoicchātanhārā.""As You like. If You want to maintain, that is also good; if You want to kill, that is also good."" This is devotee's view."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Someone might say, ""But if one is surrendered why shouldKṛṣṇagive him trouble?""",Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is because he is always free. Why do you makeKṛṣṇadependent on your so-called goodwill, that ""Kṛṣṇa must give me always pleasure""? This is sense gratification. This is sense gratification that you approachKṛṣṇafor your comfort, sense gratification. That is notbhakti.That is sense gratification.PrahlādaMahārājawas given suffering by his father so harshly, but he never said, ""Oh, I am devotee andKṛṣṇagiving me so much trouble? Oh! Give it up."" He never said that. Neither he askedKṛṣṇato come and save him. That isKṛṣṇa-bhakti.The Pāṇḍavas. The Pāṇḍavas, they were always withKṛṣṇaand they were suffering. They never askedKṛṣṇathat ""You are the Supreme, and why we are suffering?"" Never said. Never said. That isKṛṣṇa-bhakti."
Girirāja:,"Girirāja:""Because You are the Absolute Truth, there is no difference between Your mercy and punishment.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. This is to be understood. If we understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Absolute Truth, then this is understanding, that either suffering or enjoying, it is all Kṛṣṇa's mercy. There must be some purpose.

<div class=""Purport""><span class=""Bold""><a href=""/d/nitai"" class=""d"">Nit&#257;i</a>:</span> This verse is a reply to Arjuna's third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> activities. <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> activities are known as <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/bhakti"" class=""d"">bhakti</a>-<a href=""/d/yoga"" class=""d"">yoga</a>&mdash;</span>always acting for <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. This includes not only <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but His different plenary expansions such as <a href=""/d/rama"" class=""d"">R&#257;ma</a> and <a href=""/d/narayana"" class=""d"">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily. This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity's spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/bhakti"" class=""d"">bhakti</a>-<a href=""/d/yoga"" class=""d"">yoga</a>. <a href=""/d/bhakti"" class=""d"">Bhakti</a>-<a href=""/d/yoga"" class=""d"">yoga</a> </span>means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/bhakti"" class=""d"">bhakti</a>-<a href=""/d/yoga"" class=""d"">yoga</a>. </span>If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become <a href=""/d/brahman"" class=""d"">Brahman</a>, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature: <span class=""Italic"">brahmaiva <a href=""/d/san"" class=""d"">san</a> brahm&#257;pyeti. </span>One can attain the Supreme <a href=""/d/brahman"" class=""d"">Brahman</a> by becoming <a href=""/d/brahman"" class=""d"">Brahman</a>. This means that one must qualitatively become one with <a href=""/d/brahman"" class=""d"">Brahman</a>. By attainment of <a href=""/d/brahman"" class=""d"">Brahman</a>, one does not lose his eternal <a href=""/d/brahman"" class=""d"">Brahman</a> identity as individual soul.</div>

<div class=""Normal-Level"">In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness has nothing to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God's service, in <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value.

In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme <a href=""/d/brahman"" class=""d"">Brahman</a> and annihilating one's individuality becomes hellish, and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like broken serpents' teeth. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as <a href=""/d/vaikuntha"" class=""d"">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>, or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee.

But we do try to direct them towards an awareness of what is best and what is most good for them and what is most spiritually nourishing in the world about them, in so far as the system allows us. And I speak of my friend Michael and we here. And the one condition or emotional state&mdash;because very frequently the students are not mature enough to be in a spiritual condition, they are in a emotional condition rather than a spiritual one&mdash;what we are faced with, is the basic question of ""Who am I?"" ""What is it all about?"" ""Why am I here?"" ""Why should I be here""? ""Who are you, and who the hell are you to tell me what to think or what to read or what not to read? Why should I read Shakespeare? Or why should I read Saint Augustine? Or why should I listen to Mozart? I prefer Bob Dylan,"" and these kind of questions which seem to emanate from a very disillusioned state of mind, an insecurity, an uncertainty, and a lack of credibility in the total structure of things as they are. And so we're frequently faced with not just directly having to answer these questions, as I said didactically answering them by saying in a catechismic sort of way: ""Who am I?"" ""You are..."" ""What am I doing here?"" ""You are doing this here,"" which one can do, of course, also.</div>
