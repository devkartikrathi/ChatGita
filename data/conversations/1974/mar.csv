Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:We haveKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He, he was worshipingViṣṇuat home, and he was trying to killKṛṣṇa. Similarly, there are many Vaiṣṇavas likeJarāsandha-apparently worshipingViṣṇu—but trying to killKṛṣṇa.Jarāsandha-Vaiṣṇava."
Jayapatākā:,Jayapatākā:So what is the value of such worship ofViṣṇu?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Jayapatākā:,Jayapatākā:So what is the benefit of such worship ofViṣṇu?Jarāsandhaworship?,Prabhupāda,"They will get material opulence.Asuras,they want material opulence. They, they do not understand what is spiritual life or spiritual happiness, what is devotional service. Neither they'd like to understand. Which way?"

Madhudviṣa:,"Madhudviṣa:I don't know. It is possible, but it is incomprehensible.",Prabhupāda,Everything is incomprehensible. How the planets are floating in this air?
Madhudviṣa:,Madhudviṣa:BecauseKṛṣṇais in them.,Prabhupāda,"Then, similarly,Kṛṣṇadesires; everything is possible."

Bhavānanda,"...spiritual master. Then when he reaches a certain point, he lets go. What is...? What becomes of Him? He is alsoMāyāvādī.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That isMāyāvādīphilosophy. [break] ...philosophy,cakhudāna diloyeijanmejanmeprabhusei.NarottamadāsaṬhākura sings that, ""One who has opened my eyes, my spiritual master, he's my father, life after life.""

Nitāi,Is there some story related to the way in which Māyāpura was found byJagannāthadāsaBābājī?,Prabhupāda,"The Ganges is going sometimes that side, then this side. So it was under the impression that originalCaitanyaMahāprabhu's birthsite is now under water. Or there were many theories and suggestions. Later on,JagannāthadāsaBābājī said that ""Here is the...""HareKṛṣṇa."

So if you, one is sincere toKṛṣṇa, he will act everything rightly because the direction is...Buddhiyogaṁdadāmitam.The perfect direction is there.

Jayapatākā:,Jayapatākā:Mist.,Prabhupāda,"Nihāramivabhāskara.Let the scientists do it in their scientific way, drive away the fog. Is there any process? Eh? In the ocean, when there is fog like this, they have to stop all the ships and cry, (makes sound like fog horn:) onnnh, onnnh, so that they may not collide. I have seen it when I was coming, going toUSA. Where is Mohanānanda? He is here? No. Mohanānanda?HareKṛṣṇa. The difference between other camps and our: they call these men from their daily, I mean to say, life, householder's life, for this purpose for a week or so, but they are not dedicated. Here, in our camp, all our people are dedicated to the cause. That is the difference. So they cannot surpass your activities."
Jayapatākā:,"Jayapatākā:Because you are dedicated, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, everyone should be dedicated, I or you. Does not... That is the success of life. Dedicate your life forKṛṣṇa. That is the perfection. Even there are some faults, even dedicated life is noble life. Maybe, due to our past habits, we may commit some faulty action, but that dedicated life is sublime.Apicetsudurācārobhajatemāmananya-bhāk, sādhurevasamantavyaḥ[Bg.9.30]."

That brain, these rascals, they cannot find out. Machine, nature only. What is this nature? Nonsense. So which way we shall go? This way? Up to the river?"
Jayapatākā:,Jayapatākā:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Each and every grain...
Jayapatākā:,Jayapatākā:Here's our mango tree.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Viṣṇujana:,Viṣṇujana:Mango.,Prabhupāda,Mango tree?
Bhavānanda,"Yes, we planted, uh... (end)",Prabhupāda,"...no woman can... [break] So I took it very a cheap price. There was no question of woman. I kept my office there. And the address was Multani temple. It is a temple. Multani temple, Grant Road. And in my retired life my office was there,Rādhā-Kṛṣṇatemple and Delhi, Chippiwada. And my residence wasRādhā-Dāmodaratemple. And before that, thatKeśīGhāṭa. Who has seen that? You have...?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Oh yes.,Prabhupāda,That was also temple. Yes.
Indian devotee:,"Indian devotee:Very nice side, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,I lived in that house for seven years. And then I came toRādhā-Dāmodaratemple.
Devotee:,Devotee:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"Which way? [break] ...stayed in thatRādhā-Kṛṣṇatemple, Malliks. And still I am living in temple.

So the, the bull is bound up with it and he goes round, goes around. All day. Sogṛhamedhīmeans center is home, and he goes round. Throughout the whole life. They are calledgṛhamedhīs."
Hṛdayānanda,This is calledmedhi.,Prabhupāda,"Medhi,yes. Anothermedhimeans killing. So one who keeps himself in household life, he kills himself. Killing,Gṛhamedhī.And that is little long term meaning. But this is the direct meaning. Themedhirod is there, and he simply... He's very busy. Busy means within few feet. But he's thinking he's very busy. Anyone got, he has got home, and he's simply rounding about. Anywhere you go. The center is that. And what is thatgṛha?Where? Which way?"
Bhavānanda,"This way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"Nagṛhaṁgṛham ity āhurgṛhiṇīgṛhamucyate.Thegṛham,house, is not actuallygṛha.Gṛhameans the wife.Gṛhiṇīgṛhamucyatenagṛhaṁgṛham ityāhuḥ.Gṛhiṇīgṛhamucyate.So to become householder means one must have a wife. So actually round the wife.Gṛhamedhī.Round the wife. And what is wife means, everyone knows. It means round that thing. Is that good analysis?"

Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:And there were only twoHindugentlemen in the village and still, the Mohammedans received us and arranged for ourkīrtanaandprasādamdistribution.",Prabhupāda,Very nice.
Viṣṇujana:,Viṣṇujana:We felt it was Nityānanda's grace.,Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. Yes.
Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:First we were afraid.HaridāsaBrahmacārītold me: ""Oh, these are Mohammedans. They'll not help us in any way, nor will they acceptprasādam."" But then I said let us go...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Everyone will help us. Maybe... In that way sometimes Hindus are also against. It is not the Mohammedans.CaitanyaMahāprabhu's time, even the Hindus were against His movement, thebrāhmaṇas.They complained to the Kazi that ""This is notHindumovement."" You see? Thesaṅkīrtanamovement. Therefore Kazi had to take steps to stop thesaṅkīrtanamovement. So Kazi took step on the ground of complaint by the Hindus."
Nitāi,That's similar to what happened in Bombay.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Nitāi,That's similar to what happened...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Nitāi,...in Bombay.,Prabhupāda,"The Hindus, they wanted to break our temple, and they broke part of it. You do not know? Oh, how is that? There was a great agitation. By the instruction of the municipality, being bribed by the other party. You, you have not heard that we had so much...?"
Devotee:,"Devotee:Not heard, no.",Prabhupāda,How is that? It was very well...
Jayapatākā:,"Jayapatākā:In our exhibition booth, we have put up articles about it. India exhibition. Bombay has exhibited the matter.",Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHareHareRāma... [break] ...to take evening walk. This part, on the field, agricultural field. [break] ...if you have any land to purchase immediately, then I can ask Mahadevia, He can pay for that. [break] ...Americans without machine, they cannot sleep. They must smell, ""Here is a machine."" Then they can sleep. There was a fisherman. So at, in the evening... That is still in India. In the evening you can ask shelter from any householder's house. They'll give you shelter. So he came in the evening, ""Sir, I want to pass night in your home."" ""All right, you are welcome."" So the fisher basket, fishing basket. ""You keep this here, outside, and you sleep inside."" So whole day, he was restless. Then whole night, he could not sleep. Then the master said, ""You are not sleeping?"" ""No, sir."" ""Why?"" ""Now, because my baskets are kept outside."" ""What is in the basket?"" ""No, unless I smell, I cannot sleep."" (laughter) So these Americans, unless they smell about machine, they cannot sleep. ""Habit is the second nature."" For ordinary muscle work, they'll bring so many machines. I have seen. Karandhara was doing. At least that machine must come. (Makes sound like machine:)katkatkatkatkatkatkatkat. Making hole. That machine is compulsory."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Recently, Prabhupāda, I saw one machine for...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee:,"Devotee:For rubbing the nails, there is a battery operated machine.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Machine for cleansing, so many things."
Devotee:,Devotee:And for nail rubbing also.,Prabhupāda,Yes. For massaging. Everything.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:They have for brushing the teeth.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, very..."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:You just hold the toothbrush and the machine makes it go up and down.,Prabhupāda,Just see.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpānanda:Some scientists, they want to make all the different body parts. They want to give artificial arm, then artificial feet, and they're, they're spending all kinds of money and time making these complicated machinery to do the same thing that the body is doing. And the ultimate goal, these scientists were stating, their ultimate goal was to make a complete human body so that the person never has to die, but he can always change his body just before it breaks.",Prabhupāda,But the maker of that machine will die.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"He cannot save himself. He can make a machine which will not die, but he will die. Is that all right?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"How much perfect he is, that you can consider, that he's making something perfect which will not die, but he will die. So he's imperfect. So how his machine is perfect? This is common argument. He's imperfect. But he cannot make such machine that he will not die."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:They say in the future they will...,Prabhupāda,"Oh, that is, that is a... Kicking, they on their face. That is the only loophole on which we can kick on their face. You see? They are making machine perfect, but they cannot make themselves perfect. Why don't you ask that ""Why don't you make a machine that you'll not die? Your machine will not die, I accept. You're so perfect. But why you will die? Why you will die?"" What is their answer?"
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpānanda:They say that they will get to a point where, when each cause of their death, maybe, say, a bad heart, then they can get an artificial heart.",Prabhupāda,"All right, you can get everything. You will do it. But why don't you do it for yourself that you will not die?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:They'll say, ""That's all right. I'm working for posterity so that people who come in future generations...""",Prabhupāda,"What posterity. You cannot take help from your machine. What posterity you will take? It is nonsense. You are starving, and you, you want to speak that ""I will distributeprasādam."" What is this nonsense? You are starving, and you are proud of distributing food to others. Is that very good reason, a reasonable proposal? What...? First of all, you stop your starvation. Then you can say, ""Now I have stopped my starvation. I'll distribute food to the hungry men."""
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:All the scientists and leaders are all like that. They don't have the vaguest idea. They don't have the vaguest idea...,Prabhupāda,Therefore we...
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:...of anything.,Prabhupāda,"...call them rascals and fools. They may advertise themselves as scientists, but we take them as rascals and fools."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpānanda:Some of them so much want to be God, they're thinking they're going to create life and make bodies and this and that.",Prabhupāda,"The only question is that first of all, keep your life. Then you cure another life. Life in you is already there. Now keep it. Protect it by some machine or by some chemical. Then you talk all this nonsense. What do you think, ViṣṇujanaMahārāja?"
Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:At the fairs in the United States, they have exhibits of what the scientists are doing, and one scientist has actually invented a machine... Costs one hundred thousand dollars, and this machine can take the head of a man from his body and keep the brain cells still going, and they expect that this machine, they expect, they haven't done it to anyone because no one will do it...",Prabhupāda,That expectation is always there. Any fool can expect anything. That is another thing.
Viṣṇujana:,Viṣṇujana:But they've done it with goat head.,Prabhupāda,"We are concerned what you are doing now. That's all. We are not for expectation, future hope. We do not believe in that. Trust no future, however pleasant. It may be pleasant to you, but we don't believe it. You rascals, you can feel, but history shows that after death, no brain works. So we take this simple conclusion, that this brain is useless. So am I right or wrong?"
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:You are right.,Prabhupāda,"SudāmāVipra, you are very critical. You can say. Am I right or wrong?"
Vipra,SudāmāYou're right. (laughter),Prabhupāda,"Thank you. That's...SvarūpaDāmodaraasked the scientist that, ""You are beginning life from chemicals. Suppose I give you chemicals, can you make life?"" ""That I cannot say."" This is their proposal. This is their... All rascals. And they're wasting public money and making other fools. They're going to the Candraloka and thisloka, Venus. Simply wasting time. This remark I gave in the newspaper sometimes inSanFrancisco..."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:When they asked about the moon.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. It is simply waste of time and energy. That's all. And in 1968 I wrote thatEasy Journey:""And this is all childish."""
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Sputniks.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Have you read that?
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Yes. It is very nice.,Prabhupāda,"So we can boldly say on the strength of Vedic literature that all these attempts are childish and those who are attempting, they're all fools and rascals. That's all. Now they're silent about moon expedition. They're trying to go to Venus. What happened to moon, moon planet?"
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Yeah right.,Prabhupāda,Another diversion. That's all.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Just wasting money and time.,Prabhupāda,Another diversion of attention so that they can exploit public money in that way. And the public is also fooled that they believe all this nonsense.
Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:In the United States, Prabhupāda, the rocks that they brought back from the moon are being displayed in all the different cities. They have little small pieces of the rocks from the moon. And people stand in long lines...",Prabhupāda,Just see...
Viṣṇujana:,Viṣṇujana:...to come and see these little pieces of rock.,Prabhupāda,...how much rascal you are.
Viṣṇujana:,Viṣṇujana:And they have guards all around the little rocks.,Prabhupāda,Gods?
Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:With guns, with guns.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, guards."
Viṣṇujana:,Viṣṇujana:With guns. So no one will steal.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Devotee:,"Devotee:They don't pray God, who has made all of this.",Prabhupāda,"No, that one, I mean to say, rogue, thief, came to a bank manager. Somewhere in Western countries. And he brought some lotions. So he said that ""I shall mix up these lotions. Immediately the whole bank will be blown up."" So he became afraid because the scientists do that. So... ""So you give me check immediately, two hundred millions or something, otherwise I'll mix it."" So he gave him that check. And... Because they were... ""It is time bomb. If you call police or arrest me within this time, then it will blown up."" So in this way, he took away the check. And after sometimes, he phoned to the police, ""This is the situation. Come and help us. Here is a time bomb on my table."" So police came. They also took it very carefully in the chemical laboratory. And in the chemical lab, they were also afraid. Then they saw it is glycerin. That's all. Such fools are there. You see. It is simply exploiting the innocent public of their money, hard-earned money. That's all. And if you go to such foundation that ""Give us some money for spreadingKṛṣṇaconsciousness, printing these books,"" ""No, no. We are not interested in religion. We are for scientific improvement, glycerin."""
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Rational. They think they are very rational.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Rational. A dog is also rational. But a dog is dog, a man is man. Dog, if a dog is called, ""Hut"", he's not rational? He'll stop immediately. So is not rational?"
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"That is rational. One who has got reason. ""So this man wants to check me."" So he stops. For eating, he has rational, what is his eatable. Dog does not like preparation made with too much ghee. They will like meat, rotten meat, and dried bones. That is rational. ""This is my food."""
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And similarly, hog also, he likes to eat stool thanhalavā.He has got rationality. As you will not eat stool, you will likehalavā,you have got rationality, then hog has got rationality. He'll not eathalavā,he'll eat stool. So where is the want of rationality? Why don't you eat stool? That is rationality. So similarly, he does not eathalavā.So where is the difference between you in the matter of rationality? You deny something, he denies something. Where is want of rationality?"
Jayapatākā:,"Jayapatākā:Bhavānandahas said that in his previous life he had a pet pig, and he used to offer the pig sweet, but the pig would take the sweet and... He would not eat it. He would roll it in dirt. And when it is filled with dirt, then only he would eat.",Prabhupāda,Just see.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpānanda:It tasted so bad, he had to have something that tasted good around it so that he could get it down.",Prabhupāda,"(laughs) It is not for the hog, but a human being... I had a friend. If you give himrasagullā,he'll want little salt.Rasagullāwith little salt, he'll eat. Without salt, he cannot eat. And my father, he was, at the last stage of his taking, some rice mixed with milk. While eating that, he'll take a little curry also. So it is a taste."
Jayapatākā:,"Jayapatākā:Thailand. And there they would offer the peoplerasagullā,but they would put soy sauce on it.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Jayapatākā:,Jayapatākā:They would put this bitter sauce on it. Then only they would take.,Prabhupāda,"And in Burma, myGuruMahārājaopened a branch. So when they were fryingpuri,the, nice ghee, all the tenants, ""Oh! What you are...!?"" (laughter) They cannot tolerate. But in Burma, there is a preparation which is callednafi.Thenafimeans that a, a big jar will be kept on the door, and whatever animals, insect, cockroaches will die, they'll put in that. And during rainy season, it will be filled with water. And it will be kept for years. Then... And the bad smell was so terrible that if somebody would open the lid, it will immediately create very bad smell. So after some years, they will strain the water and keep in bottle. And when there is festival, they'll supply it in small... That is callednafi.And they'll take it very pleasantly. And when they were frying ghee, ""Oh! What you are doing, this?!"" Therefore NarottamadāsaṬhākura says that"
Devotee:,Devotee:No. Nobody would.,Prabhupāda,"So theBrahmanrealization is like that. Every living entity, he wantsānanda. Ānandameans just like we are walking together, talking together. This isānanda.If I would have walked alone, it would have been noānanda.I do not like. Nobody likes. Soānandameans there must be entourage. Thereforeānandais withKṛṣṇa. When we play withKṛṣṇa, we dance withKṛṣṇa, talk withKṛṣṇa, serveKṛṣṇa, take care ofKṛṣṇa, then there isānanda.And simply to become one with theBrahman,then you will have to fall down again. Thereforejñāna-kāṇḍais not perfect. Andkarma-kāṇḍais, you can migrate from one body to another or one planet to another. You'll bebrahmāṇḍabhramite.You have to wander. Andjñāna-kāṇḍameans you merge. That is also intolerable. Therefore unless you come tobhakti-kāṇḍa,there is no question of real life and bliss. That is the conclusion."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"And after eating meat, then seven hundred years old loaf. Cut it and add with little butter. That's all. And then take wine.Bās. Kadaryabhakṣaṇakare.Now they're eatingrasagullā.Am I right or wrong?"
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpānanda:I didn't hear what you said. Now they're eating...,Prabhupāda,Explain.
Jayapatākā:,"Jayapatākā:Ācchā,the way back we passed. Do you want to go back yet or around to the end?",Prabhupāda,"Eh? [break] ...In every life, there isāvaraṇātmikā-śakti.He'll think that ""I am very well situated."" Even in the hog's life. That ismāyā.Similarly, even if you are thinking, ""Now we have got human body. We are well situated than the hog,"" that is also mistake. That is also mistake. ""I am European, American, I have got so comfortable."" Everything is wrong. Because you have to transmigrate. You do not know what is the next life. So what is the meaning of this well-situated. That is the mistake. That ismāyā.You are not sure that you'll continue this life. You'll have to die. You have to accept.

AndRāmānandaRāyawas agṛhastha.He was not even abrāhmaṇa.And governor, very opulent. Very comfortable situation. You know this?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So howCaitanyaMahāprabhutreated them equally or gave better position toRāmānandaRāyathanRūpaGosvāmī? This question was raised—not only now—when ourGuruMahārājastartedGauḍīyaMaṭha. So he was allowing thesannyāsīsto live in palatial building and go in car for preaching work. So many such persons questioned, ""How is that,sannyāsīsare going in car, living in palatial building?"" So ourGuruMahārājareplied that ""A devotee should be offered the best comfort of life. And if he would not have introduced this comfortable life, at the same time, to become pure devotee, then these devotees from Western countries will, would never come. They would never agree to sit down under the tree and, imitatingRūpaGosvāmī... That is not possible."" Do you understand or not?"

He must be activity. Otherwise, there must be dysentery, eating and sleeping. He cannot digest. Yes. So in this way, our society should be managed. Not that ""Give me second initiation, a sacred thread."" And after getting it, business finished: ""Now I'm liberated. Let me eat and sleep."" This should be stopped. We have got fifty <span class=""Italic"">bigh&#257;s</span> of land, and I have calculated in M&#257;y&#257;pura, setting aside twenty <span class=""Italic"">bigh&#257;s</span> for the temple and grazing ground for the cows, thirty <span class=""Italic"">bigh&#257;s</span> of land.

But he made that, ""Thank you very much. You give me this benediction that I may remain a pure devotee of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>."" This is <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>. He is doing everything, but his aim is to please <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>.
