Prajāpati,"...getting worse over these five thousand years, but by a reintroduction, reintroducingKṛṣṇaconsciousness, the tide can be turned in age ofKali?",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. That is the only remedy. That is the only remedy. Anyone who takes to this chanting ofHareKṛṣṇamantra,he'll be cleansed of all sinful activities and then everything will come out nice. And it is practical. It is not story. Just see, all our disciples in Europe, America, they were habituated to so many bad habits, and because they are chanting, they are now cleansed. So it is small-scale. If you propagate it large-scale, everyone will be cleansed. [break] ...disciples who were trained up from very beginning of their life: meat-eating. They are giving meat-eating. Here in your country, small children, they are fed with meat-powder. Intoxication is also a daily affair. How they are giving up all intoxication? [break] Is there arrangement for... Where is Karandhara?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Jaya,Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"That placard, poster?"
Prajāpati,Nara-nārāyaṇaPrabhu's good wife is expert artist.,Prabhupāda,Ah.
Nara,Nara-nārāyaṇa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, she is very nice, good artist. Give her engagement like this."
Prajāpati,Maybe you could explain us a little more detail of the...,Prabhupāda,"No, with very much detail it will be cumbrous. You... Symbolic representation."
Prajāpati,Those three figures in the center?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prajāpati,"One is a devotee, one is a...",Prabhupāda,"No, everyone is devotee."
Prajāpati,"Yes, they are all three devotees.",Prabhupāda,But they're engaged in three departments.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:We were thinking for the administrator there could be a judge.,Prabhupāda,Ah.
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Could be a judge, a high-court judge.",Prabhupāda,Yes. That means administrator.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Yes. The other one could be the president.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, president also administrator. No, one is in the religious order. That is also required. But here we see, persons who are in religious order, they're also addicted to these four sinful, four sinful life. And he's presenting himself as religious."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:On the one should we depict meat-eating or animal slaughter?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Should we depict animal-slaughter or meat-eating?,Prabhupāda,Animal slaughter.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Animal slaughter.,Prabhupāda,That will be still broader.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"The three figures and one is in a suit, one... They all havetilaka,neck beads and bead bag... Religious man may be in saffron color, asannyāsī,atridaṇḍīsannyāsī.Our GurukṛpāMahārāja? Where is he?"
Karandhara:,Karandhara:GurukṛpāMahārāja.,Prabhupāda,Eh? Here are religious men.
Prajāpati,How will we distinguish between the other two men? They'll both be in suits.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Well, the one man, the president, will be behind the presidential podium, presidential seal. In the front. And the other man would be a high-court judge with...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:...with black robes on.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Nara,"Nara-nārāyaṇa:With a, two balls.",Prabhupāda,"Make nicely this picture. Short-cut, at the same time very convincing. [break] Yes?"
New Devotee:,New Devotee:I'm very new to thisKṛṣṇaconscious movement and I'm not as firm as your devotees. Right now I'm being torn in half.Māyāis so strong and I see so much of what you say. Is there...,Prabhupāda,What is this?
New Devotee:,New Devotee:Doubts.,Prabhupāda,What is your doubt?
New Devotee:,New Devotee:Mental speculation.,Prabhupāda,So you want to continue it or stop it?
New Devotee:,New Devotee:Stop it.,Prabhupāda,"Then stop it. Take instruction from theśāstra.Don't speculate. That will not help you. The same example, a child's speculation, ""Who is my father?"" He will never be successful. But as soon as he asks his mother, ""Who is my father?"" Immediately knowledge: ""Here is your father."" Finished."
New Devotee:,New Devotee:Association is very important.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
New Devotee:,New Devotee:Association.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. One has to take information from the authority. That knowledge is perfect. And these rascals, philosophical, scientific speculation, all useless waste of time."
New Devotee:,"New Devotee:I live in Long Beach and I will be going to school soon, but I'm...",Prabhupāda,"Hm. We don't accept any speculative knowledge. We want final conclusion of the experienced person.Nṛpa-nirṇītaḥ,this word is used.Nṛpa-nirṇītaḥ,it is concluded.Kavibhirnirūpitaḥ.Idaṁhipuṁsas śrutas...,tapasaḥśrutasyavā. Avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhirnirūpitaḥ. Nirṇītaḥ...These words are... It is already concluded. There is no question of argument. In the Vedic literature, these words are used,nṛpa-nirṇītaḥ,nirūpitaḥ."
New Devotee:,New Devotee:I should abandon...,Prabhupāda,"Nāsatovidyatebhāvonā...,asataḥvidyatebhāvaḥ.What is the next line? So, we take things which is conclusive. The scientists, they are making experiment, where is the beginning of life. Misled. They are thinking life is from matter. They have no experience. Still, the rascal Darwin gave a theory. They are persisting on it. They have no practical experience that life is coming from matter. That is calledvṛścika-taṇḍula-nyāya.You have no experience in your country. We have got. Sometimes you'll find, scorpion is coming out from the stack of rice. You have seen it?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:I haven't seen it, but I have heard of the example.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So they are thinking the rice is..., rice is producing the scorpion. It is calledtaṇḍula-vṛścika-nyāya.But rice cannot produce a life. The real fact is a scorpion lays down the egg within the rice, and by the fermentation it comes out. Just eggs. And the small creature comes out. And foolish creatures, they think it that the rice is producing scorpion. That is not possible. So they are putting forward this evolution theory that man is coming from monkey, but no monkey is producing a man. Nobody has seen. There are so many things. They put forward some theory, but it is not fact."
New Devotee:,New Devotee:The quickest way to knowledge...,Prabhupāda,"Quickest way to knowledge... That I told you; take the knowledge from the authority. The example I have already given that you cannot make research, search out who is your father. But if you go to the authority, mother, immediately you understand. This is the quickest way."
New Devotee:,"New Devotee:The thing that's tearing me apart is, um...",Prabhupāda,"But just try to understand this. The principle is that if you receive knowledge from the real authority, that is perfect and quick. And if with your imperfect senses you want to acquire knowledge by searching out, it will never be successful. The modern method is to search out the truth by their imperfect senses. All these scientists, philosophers, they are doing that. They admit that their senses are imperfect. Still, they are trying to go to the perfect by the imperfect senses. This is their defect. They are hoping that ""Our imperfectness will be perfect by this research work."" That is not possible. Imperfectness will remain ever imperfect."
Prajāpati,"They glorify such imperfections, Śrīla Prabhupāda, by saying...",Prabhupāda,"Unless they glorify their imperfection, how they can stand? (laughter) They have no standing. If they do not glorify, then they are proved rascals. There will be no argument. They'll have to accept that ""we are rascals."" Therefore they have to glorify. The glorifying society... That is mentioned in theBhāgavata.The glorifying society is consisting of ass, camel, hog, and what is the other?"
Devotees:,Devotees:Dog.,Prabhupāda,"Dog. So we...śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥsaṁstutaḥpuruṣaḥpaśuḥ[SB2.3.19].They are all ass, camels, dogs, like that and they are praising each other. ""Oh, you have discovered this. Oh, how nice you are. (laughter) How nice you are."" But we understand the praiser and the praised, both are dogs and cats. That's all. So we don't give any benefit. It is a mutual praising society of cats and dogs, so we don't give any benefit. Now, they can also accuse us in the same way, that ""You are also the society of cats and dog, mutual praising society."" So... Now, who will judge whether they are right or we are right? Who will judge? Eh? There must be some judgement. Everyone will say that ""I am right."" But who judges? There must be a judge, that through both side the lawyers is fighting, that ""My case is right."" Then who will give judgement? There must be one judge. So who is that judge?"
Prajāpati,"śāstra,guru,sādhu.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. That is the judge. Therefore we quote from Vedic literatures. As soon as we speak something, immediately quote Vedic literature. That is the way."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:The trouble is there are so many phony gurus andśāstras.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:There are so many misrepresentations.,Prabhupāda,"Because their folly is... They therefore do not take authority. Otherwise they'll be exposed. Yes.śāstra-cakṣusā.Yaḥśāstra-vidhimutsṛjyavartatekāma-kārataḥ[Bg.16.23].These are the injunctions. (dog barks) Yes, come on. We have got your punishment. So there is an argument:palabonatu hoya(?). ""I'm not afraid of you. Although I'm, I'm going away, I'm not afraid of you. (laughter) Don't think that I am afraid of you."" This is dog business. They'll go, ""gow!"" and go away, go away. They'll not come forward. Come on. (laughter) [break] Well, our every day is a New Year.Nava-navayauvana.OurKṛṣṇaconsciousness is so nice, the more you advance, you see new year, new year. That's all. Nothing is old. People are seeing that they are simply chanting the old slogan,HareKṛṣṇa."
Devotee:,Devotee:HareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"But we are feeling new pleasure in every moment. Take any other chanting, you cannot chant more than few hours. But theHareKṛṣṇamantrawe can chant perpetually. So unless there is new enlightenment, how we can do that? [break] You can preach here, and then we are starting on the..., by the fourteenth. We shall go together to India. Is that all right? What do you think?"
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Are you bringing your boys over there?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:If we go the other way it's cheaper.,Prabhupāda,Which way?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Through New York.,Prabhupāda,[break] I cannot go there. You see? As if three hundred miles away.
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:[break] We saw from the plane.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:It was there for forty-five minutes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, a bad sign..."
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:As big as the sky.,Prabhupāda,How big?
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:Very brilliant.,Prabhupāda,One part like this?
Gurukṛpā:,"Gurukṛpā:About forty-five min..., we..., it was still going but the plane passed it and it stayed behind.",Prabhupāda,"Uh, so, this is a bad sign. Constellation. According to astronomical calculations. Therefore we, we follow the astrology according to the constellation. The child born, everything has connection, the constellation of the star has influence on the child. So therefore the horoscope-maker takes the calculation of the constellation and then calculate what is his future. Thisdhūmaketuis described inDaśāvatāra-stotra,dhūmaketumivakimapikarālam.Dhūmaketumiva.Dhūmaketumivakimapikarālam.As soon as there is comet, there will be some disaster. Very great disaster. In our childhood we saw the comet, not this like. That was small comet. Still, the first world war was there declared. That we have seen in 1914."
Nara,Nara-nārāyaṇa:Halley's comet.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Nara,Nara-nārāyaṇa:I think they called it Halley's comet. Halley's comet.,Prabhupāda,"Now the... You can expect at any moment disaster in this material world, but the comet is the sign that there will be some great disaster. It is... This material world, in every step there is disaster.Padaṁpadaṁyadvipadām[SB10.14.58].But those who have taken shelter ofKṛṣṇa, the disaster is not meant for them.Samāśritāyepada-pallava-plavam.Padaṁpadaṁyadvipadāṁnateṣām.So how big it is?"
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:Very big.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:It was very spectacular. Something like twenty miles.,Prabhupāda,Twenty miles?
Jayatīrtha:,Jayatīrtha:The scientists say that it's eighty-three million miles long...,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Jayatīrtha:,"Jayatīrtha:The scientists, they say that it's 83 million miles long, the comet.",Prabhupāda,83 miles?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:The tail.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:The tail is 83 million miles. It's going fast, very forward, so it's emitting a tail of gases.",Prabhupāda,So who is supplying the gas? (laughter) The Arabians?
Gurukṛpā:,"Gurukṛpā:When it comes to doing thekīrtana,there's no energy shortage for us. We have unlimited stock.",Prabhupāda,"By presence of the comet, the atmosphere is also polluted. Last time, what I saw, it was like this. Round and then tail. It is like that?"
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:No.,Prabhupāda,No.
Gurukṛpā:,"Gurukṛpā:A long streak. It was behind the clouds. There were many clouds, and you could see it through the clouds.",Prabhupāda,"What is the speed? If it is 83 million miles, very heavy thing, then the speed must be also."
Prajāpati,"There must be living entities then on the comet. Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,Oh yes. Everywhere there are living entities.
Jayatīrtha:,Jayatīrtha:Scientists are very excited about the comet because they think that it's made of the primordial substance of the universe and they think they'll be able to find out some clue how the solar system was created by examining the comet with their telescopes. (laughter),Prabhupāda,"Let them talk all nonsense. We say in Bengali,pāgalekinābole, chāgalekinākhāya.The goat can eat everything, and a madman can speak anything. (laughter)Pāgalekinākhāya..., pāgalekinābole, chāgalekinākhāya."
Prajāpati,"Are the living entities on the comet, are they very demoniac or intelligent or...?",Prabhupāda,Not necessarily demoniac. Two classes of men are always there: intelligent and demon. [break]
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:...comet. They just discovered it one or two years ago. They said that if it ever passed by the earth before, it was the time of the dinosaurs.",Prabhupāda,Dinosaur?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Yes. Over fifty thousand years ago.,Prabhupāda,"(chuckles) He cannot say what happened yesterday, and he's speaking fifty thousand years. Is there a statement in anyśāstraor his own statement?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:No, that's by mathematical calculation of the trajectory and speed.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, mathematics..."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:It's going at a certain speed in a certain orbit. So they calculate that it would complete that orbit once every fifty to two hundred thousand years.,Prabhupāda,"That is there in astrology, astronomy. That is not discovery."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:No, actually, one scientist just looked at a telescope and saw it coming. And that's what they call discovery. And of course, he got the comet named after him.",Prabhupāda,Who?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:The scientist. His name was Kahotek. So he discovered it. So the comet is named after him.,Prabhupāda,And if it is mentioned elsewhere?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:I'm sure he'll want to keep his claim.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:I'm sure he'll want to keep his claim.,Prabhupāda,"No, if... In some astrological book, if it is mentioned there?"
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Ah. Yes.,Prabhupāda,Ah?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They say they've looked through all the old books and the old records and they haven't found any mention of it.,Prabhupāda,I think in the Indian astronomical calendar there must be mention.
Nara,Nara-nārāyaṇa:[break] ...effect of comet?,Prabhupāda,"No, generally we know when there is comet, there is very bad effect."
Prajāpati,The comet doesn't really bring the bad effect. It simply is a symptom. Is that it?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Prajāpati,"The comet doesn't bring the bad effect, it is a symptom.",Prabhupāda,"No, yes, bring, bring."
Prajāpati,It does bring it.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prajāpati,Does such a comet affect consciousness as well as matter?,Prabhupāda,"Eh? Comet is just like a planet. It is a vehicle carrying so many conscious beings. It is just like if some policeman all of a sudden comes before us, it is to be supposed that someone is criminal, he's searching. Like that. (end) ...service."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Yes, I did.",Prabhupāda,You give me... [break]
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):He's in the... Parking the car.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. [break] ...plan for wasting time. (devotees laugh) So the material world means they have got different devices for wasting time, not for utilizing time. Is it correct?"
Prajāpati,"It is considered one of our major problems, leisure time. People are having more time on their hands and they do not know what to do with it. So the government, they're scratching their heads inventing things for people to waste their time.",Prabhupāda,"This is the difficulty.Nateviduḥsvārtha-gatiṁhiviṣṇum[SB7.5.31].Because they are rascal, they do not know how to utilize time, what is the aim of life, where you have to go. These things they don't know. So they must waste time. So it is the... Just like child. He wastes time in so many ways. It is the duty of the parents, guardians, to cr..., synchronize his activities so that he may not waste his time. It is the duty of the guardians. Similarly these rascals, they're wasting time. You have to engage them inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Then their time will be utilized. [break]"
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):...in Holland wasn't any fuel Sundays, and the people could go outside with the cars, and then the statistics say that the fight between the family increased so, so much the police went... They went to the houses to, just to separate the people because there was fighting so much because they didn't have anywhere to go on Sundays. (devotees laugh)",Prabhupāda,"Just see. It has become a problem, ah, to remain at home. [break]"
Prajāpati,"...society, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it would train up brahminical qualities. But in the people in general, how can we engage them also inKṛṣṇaconsciousness? How can we provide them a means to use their leisure time to perfect their lives?",Prabhupāda,Just chantHareKṛṣṇa. Is it very difficult?
Prajāpati,To get them to do it is difficult.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, let's call them in our temple, be practiced. Therefore our society is the most important society. We can teach people how to utilize time properly and be perfect. [break]"
Prajāpati,"...well you utilize your time, Śrīla Prabhupāda, every second is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. And our advanced Godbrothers, they've also learned this art. The vast majority of us, we haven't quite got the hang of it yet.",Prabhupāda,"It is practiced. As by practicing you become a first-class drunkard, similarly by practicing you can become a first-classKṛṣṇaconscious. It is equal.Abhyāsa-yoga-yuktenacetasānānya-gāminā[Bg.8.8].Abhyāsa.Practice. In association the practice is very easily done. Just like you are saying, that you are engaged. So by association you can learn also. The association is very important. [break]"
Prajāpati,"...Śrīla Prabhupāda. You're very, very regulated, almost down to the minute in your activities. This is also a big help in utilizing time?",Prabhupāda,"Yes.Avyarthakālatam(?) That explains the... This is... This should be our aim. Not a single moment is wasted. If you try that ""How I'm wasting my time,"" then you'll utilize it. You should always remember. Not a single moment should be wasted. That is advised byRūpaGosvāmī.Avyarthakālatam.Vyarthameans spoiling.Avyarthameans not spoiling.Avyarthakāla.He should be always conscious that ""I am not wasting my time.""

They want to drink only, twenty-four hours. As soon as the bottle is finished, they're finding somebody who will pay one dollar, and purchase another small bottle. They're doing only business this. [break]"
Prajāpati,...the holy name and devotional service.,Prabhupāda,Ah?
Prajāpati,"You want us to be drunkards on the holy name, and be like those...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. There is eight kinds of transcendental transformation... (pause) (devotees chantjapa) [break]"
Prajāpati,"...foolish play tennis, and the lazy foolish they play golf. (Prabhupāda laughs) [break]",Prabhupāda,...less dangerous than the active foolish. (devotees chantjapa)[break]
Prajāpati,In theBhagavad-gītāit is indicated by ŚrīKṛṣṇathat when we approach a bona fide spiritual master our relationship is twofold. We render service and then we also make inquiry.,Prabhupāda,Yeah.
Devotee (4):,Devotee (4):Read the books.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Read the books, yes. Why I'm working so hard? Read the books. [break] ...don't find him in the class also."
Devotee (4):,"Devotee (4):Who should, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,Śrutakīrti.
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:I heard yesterday he was married.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:He went to officially. I... We tried yesterday to convince him, but he would not listen.",Prabhupāda,Officially he's married now.
Devotee:,Devotee:Yes. [break],Prabhupāda,"...seen that one who is married, he's lamenting, and who is not married, he's also lamenting. Is it not? Ah? One who is married, he's thinking, ""Why did I marry? I would have remained free."" He's lamenting. And who is not married, ""Oh, I did not accept wife. I would have been happy."" (laughs) (Hindi) There's a Hindi... It just like (Hindi). One who has eaten, he's also lamenting, and who has not eaten, he's also lamenting.

The child is suffering and the parents also suffering to take care. So, again he begets another child.

Doing the same thing.Tṛpyantinehakṛpaṇābahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.Therefore a sane person,kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁviṣahetadhīraḥ.Therefore one who isdhīra,one who becomes sober, he tolerates the sensations, itching sensations. It is after all itching sensation. So one who can tolerate the itching sensation, he saves so much trouble. But one who cannot, he's implicated, immediately. Either illicit or legitimate, it is trouble.Yanmaithunādi...That is the only happiness in this material world. That is only happiness.Yanmaithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁhituccham[SB7.9.45].One who wants to remain in this material world, his only happiness is sex life.

[break] Becoming master of the dog, he has become servant of the dog."
Prajāpati,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Just see practically. A man keeps the dog to give him protection when he'll be attacked by somebody. But to wait for that time he has to give twenty-four-hour service to the dog. (dog barking)
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):I think he knows you're talking about him.,Prabhupāda,Ah?

Prajāpati,"Everything looks brand new, looks very different.",Prabhupāda,Ah?
Prajāpati,"This is the first time we've gone this direction, everything looks different, looks like a total different place.",Prabhupāda,"(chuckles) This is material life. We are rounding sometimes this way, sometimes that way, and we are thinking ""new."" (devotees laugh)Eirūpebrahmāṇḍabhramitekona[Cc.Madhya19.151].In this way you are wandering all over the universe. Find out something new. But there is nothing new. Everything is old. [break] ...a living entity is offered change of the body. You see? When he becomes fatigued of this life, ""It's so troublesome""—old men generally think like that. So he has to change another, another new body, child. Since born he is taken care, he thinks ""Now, I have got so comfortable life."" And again becomes old, disgusted, so he cannot live disgusting, thereforeKṛṣṇais so kind: ""All right, change body again.""Punaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30].Chewing the chewed. The business is the same, but changing body gives some relief. Just like these men, the business is they're wasting time by changing, wasting time at home, come to the golf club. That's all. The business is the same—wasting time, either here or there.Kṛṣṇais giving so much facilities. Sometimes, ""All right, you become tree."" ""All right, some, become a serpent,"" ""All right, you become a demigod,"" ""All right, you become a human being,"" ""All right, you become king,"" ""You become a cobbler,"" ""You go to the heavenly planets,"" ""Go to the hellish planets."" Varieties is there.Kṛṣṇais so kind that He's changing varieties, atmosphere of life. But he's packed up in this material world. That freedom... He's asking for freedom, but he does not know the freedom is the shelter ofKṛṣṇa. That he'll not accept. ThereforeKṛṣṇahas arranged so many varieties. In disgust the Māyāvādīs, they want to make the varieties variety-less,nirviśeṣa.And the Buddhists they want to make it zero. But that is also not possible. Remain zero for some time. Again he will want varieties. Big, bigMāyāvādīsannyāsī,they preach so muchbrahmasatyaṁjaganmithyā,but again they come to the political work, social work. Simply remain asbrahma,""I ambrahma,"" you cannot remain for many days. Then he has to accept these material varieties. Variety is the mother of enjoyment, so therefore our proposition is ""Come to the real variety,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness. Then your life will be successful."""
Prajāpati,"The Māyāvādīs, they not only misunderstand the nature of the Absolute, they misunderstand the function of thejīva.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. When one misunderstands, he misunderstands everything. One who commits mistake, he can commit mistakes in so many ways. They want to merge into the Absolute. They think that there is no variety, to avoid this variety. Ah? Just like sometimes one is suffering from some disease, they commit suicide. He thinks, ""I'm suffering. If I commit suicide, then everything will be stopped."" But he does not know that by committing suicide he'll increase another set of varieties of miserable conditions of life. He'll become ghost. And becoming ghost, you cannot enjoy anything grossly. The subtle body will create disturbance. Therefore ghost creates disturbance. He hasn't got gross body to enjoy. They're ghostly haunted; therefore a male ghost haunts over woman, woman ghost haunts over man. You know that? It so happens. Ghostly haunted."
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:In the New York temple they had a ghost upstairs.,Prabhupāda,Ah?
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:The New York temple in Brooklyn...,Prabhupāda,Aha.
Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:This is, this was the old house which was used by nuns. And in the upstairs floor, on the complete top, there used to be some nuns that were dying there, very old nuns. And when they moved into the temple there was ghosts, still there, still there is there. There's one room, it still comes.",Prabhupāda,Comes?
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:Yes. The ghost comes sometimes. They chant and put incense.,Prabhupāda,Ācchā?But she does not go away? Or does not do any harm?
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:They don't let anyone sleep in that room.,Prabhupāda,Ah.
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:Because everyone is haunted. There's many people have seen the ghost.,Prabhupāda,Ah.

Bali,BaliMardana:They don't know.,Prabhupāda,"They make it zero. Therefore, closing the eye. ""There is no next life. Finished. There is no next life."" In that way they're satisfied. Just like the rabbit. There is danger, enemy, he closes his eyes. He thinks there is no danger. (devotees laugh) So these rascals are like that. Because they cannot accommodate that this life is so troublesome, again, next life... So that they can realize. Next life means again troublesome; that's why they sometimes commit suicide.

Chaganlal, he advanced fifty-one thousand as advance, and when there was question of settlement, so he came, he wanted that ""If you give me threelakhs,then I'll compromise."" So I was prepared to pay him threelakhs.So that Mr. Ganotra, Mayor, I induced him just to make settlement. Then down he came-twolakhstwenty-five thousand. Then asked Mrs. Nair, ""Now you'll pay this..."" Where I have got... If he takes all money, then what shall I get? Then I had to settle with her how much he will pay. So she came from onelakhto onelakh,forty thousand. So what is the balance?"
Bali,BaliMardana:Sixty. Sixty... Eighty-five thousand.,Prabhupāda,"Ah? Eighty-five. So I said, ""Yes, I'll pay it. Settle up. The balance I'll pay."" Eighty-five thousand. The other man, what is called?RatnaParik?"
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Chaganlal.,Prabhupāda,"That Chaganlal this, I pay him extra eighty-five thousand. That is also black. No more white.

So he knows that we are eager to purchase. Then I said, ""Then what do you want to do?"" ""Now I want thirty thousand."" ""All right, yes. Take it."" I did not argue. In this way I settled up. And our Girirāja's father appreciated that ""It is better a bad settlement than to prolong the case."" So I took this policy. It is bad settlement, from twenty thousand to thirty thousand. But settled out. ""I give you 85,000 black."" But one thing I gain—that by cancelling the agreement, their proposal was that increase the price, twentylakhsfrom fourteenlakhs.That was the arrangement between the attorneys. They cancelled the agreement and take twentylakhsfrom him, and the balance should be divided by..., amongst us. That was the agreement. So that addition of twentylakhsI satisfied Mrs. Nair by fourteenlakhsfifty thousand."

You cannot get any spiritual idea. Thereforeharāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāḥ.Anyone who is not in the spiritual platform... Spiritual platform means to be a devotee of the Lord. TheMāyāvādīs,because they are not devotees of the Lord, they are not on the spiritual platform. They are on the material platform. They are speculating, spirit—""something negation of matter."" That's all. That is mental speculation. It is bad. ""Good means negation of bad."" They are thinking like that. They do not know, in this material world, bad and good are both the same thing. Because it is matter. That they do not know. They think, ""This is bad, this is good."" But they do not know, materially conceived anything, good or bad, they are the same thing.

So what is the use of your advancement or no advancement? One who has not advanced in science, he'll also die. And you'll also die, advanced. Then what is the good? You cannot protect yourself from death. Then what is the meaning of this ""good""? ""This is good. This is advancement, and this is not advancement."""

Umāpati:,Umāpati:And they can never be spiritual.,Prabhupāda,"No, no."
Umāpati:,Umāpati:Just always material.,Prabhupāda,"Number of zeroes never make one. It is zero. You add thousands of zeroes, one after another, the value will be zero. Not one."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But there is a theory, Śrīla Prabhupāda... Not theory. It's a fact, that if some number is raised to the power zero, that becomes one. In mathematics.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. But I am speaking that you combine millions of zeroes. That will never become one. That I am speaking. Zero is zero. Zero plus zero equal to zero. Zero minus zero equal to zero. Zero multiplied zero, zero. Zero divided by zero, zero. That's all. Where you get...? And by the side of zero, if you bring one,ekobrahma,immediately it will become ten. And add another zero, immediately hundred, ten times increased. That one must be there, one God. Then zero increases value. Similarly, this material world is zero, but if there isKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then it is valuable. Then it is valuable."
Prajāpati,"But thatmanorathena,the chariot of the mind, that is never valuable.",Prabhupāda,"No, it has no value."
Prajāpati,The whole western...,Prabhupāda,"Manorathenaasatidhāvatobahiḥ.By mental speculation, you will remain on thisasati,in this temporary field.Asatmeans ""which will not exist."" Anything in this material world, you take, that will not exist. Anywhere man can say. The skyscraper building is constructed, but everyone knows that it will not exist. Some day it will fall down. Everyone knows. It will never exist. That is explained byKṛṣṇain theBhagavad-gītā,that ""If you think that by combination of matter, life has come, so life was not there before the combination. And this combination will dismantle. So life, there will be no more life. So why these three period you are lamenting? There is life."" Because according to this theory—""The combination of matter makes life""—so before combination there was no life, and the combination dismantled, there is no life. So beginning and end no life. Why you are lamenting in the middle? Very good reasoning. Just see. ThereforePrahlādaMahārājasays,māyā-sukhāyabharamudvahatovimūḍhān[SB7.9.43].Māyā-sukhāya,that illusory, illusory happiness.Māyā-sukhāya.And for that reason, they are making huge, gorgeous arrangement and working day and night, which will be zero. It has begun from zero and it will end into zero. In the middle they are busy. Just see. Thereforevimūḍhān."
Hanumān,In your books you say that the world is like a dream.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is dream."
Hanumān,How is it a dream?,Prabhupāda,"Dream, just like last night you had some dream."
Hanumān,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Well, it has no value. It is gone. And again, this night, when you'll sleep, you'll forget all these things. You'll dream. You don't remember during night, when you are dreaming, that ""I have got my house, I have got my wife I have..."" You all forget. So it is dream."
Hanumān,It is true or is not true?,Prabhupāda,"No, no. Where is true? You forget at night. Do you remember when you sleep that you have got your wife and you are sleeping on bed? You have gone some three thousand miles away and seeing something else. Do you remember that you have got a place to reside?"
Hanumān,No.,Prabhupāda,"So this is dream at night. And night dream, what you saw at night, that is now dream. So both of them dream. You are simply visitor. That's all. You are seeing this dream and that dream. You are, you are fact, but what you are seeing, that is dream."
Hanumān,"But I have the impression that ""This is true, and my dream is not true."" What is the dif...?",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Everything is untrue. How it is true? If it is true, why you forget at night? Why you forget? If it is true. Do you remember at night?"
Hanumān,"No, I don't remember.",Prabhupāda,"Then? How it is true? As you don't remember the dreams which you saw last night..., That, therefore we say ""dream."" Similarly this thing, because you forget at night, this is also dream."
Hanumān,But I have...,Prabhupāda,"This is day-dream, that is night-dream. That's all."
Bahulāśva:,"Bahulāśva:Jaya.Day-dream and night-dream. And the night-dream, then you perceive that as being real.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Bahulāśva:,"Bahulāśva:When you dream at night, then you think that is real.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is real. You cry... It is dream, but you are crying, ""There is tiger, tiger, tiger!"" Where is tiger? But you are seeing it is fact, tiger. ""I am being killed by a tiger."" But where is tiger. [break] ...in dream you are embracing some beautiful girl. Where is that beautiful girl? But actually this is happening."
Hanumān,Is it happening?,Prabhupāda,"It is happening because there is discharge of semina, night pollution. But where is that girl? Is it not dream? So similarly this is also dream. You are having the effect of truthfulness, but it is a dream.Māyā...Therefore it is calledmāyā-sukhāya.The same thing, that at night you are dreaming you are embracing nice beautiful girl, as there is no such thing, similarly, in the daytime also, whatever advancement you are making, this is also like that.Māyā-sukhāya.We are happy, we are dreaming, ""This process will make me happy. This process will make me happy."" But the whole process is dream only. You are taking this day-dream as reality because the duration is long. At night, when you dream, the duration is for half an hour. And this is for twelve hours, or more than that. That is the difference. It is a twelve hours' dream, and that is half an hour dream. But actually, both of them are dream. And because it is twelve hours' dream, you are taking it as, accepting it as real. That is called illusion."
Bahulāśva:,Bahulāśva:Illusion.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. We are making distinction between animal and ourself, but we're forgetting, we are forgetting, the animal also will die and I will also die. So where is my advancement? Will you remain? You'll also die. So where is your advancement upon animals? That is stated inśāstra:āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithunaṁcasamānametatpaśubhirnarāṇām.Business—eating, sleeping, sex-life and defending—this is also animal's business. And you are also doing the same. How you are distinct from animal? You'll die. The animal will die. But if you say, ""I'll die after one hundred years, and this ant will die after one hour,"" that does not mean that you are in reality. It is a question of time. Just like this huge universe. It will be all be destroyed. As your body will be destroyed, this will be destroyed, annihilation, dissolution. Nature's way, everything will be dissolved. So therefore it is dream. It is a long duration dream. That's all. Nothing else. But the advantage is that even in this dream you can realize the reality, God. That is the... So if you don't take advantage of this dream, then you are missing."
Hanumān,So I am half asleep.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. This is the... ThereforeVedassays,uttiṣṭhata.""Get up, get up, get up!""Jāgṛta.""Become awakened.""Prāpyavaraṁnibodhata.""Now you have got the opportunity. Utilize it."" This is Vedic injunction.Uttiṣṭhata jāgṛtaprāpyavaraṁnibodhata.This is Vedic in...Tamasimājyotirgama.These are Vedic injunctions. So we are preaching the same thing, that ""Reality is here,Kṛṣṇa. Don't remain in this darkness. Come to this consciousness."" That is our preaching.Tamasimājyotirgama.[break] ...experienced the sunshine, bright day, and this gloomy day. So when you are in darkness, we must have to admit, ""There is light."" Because darkness means absence of light. So as we are in the darkness of this material existence, there must be something life of light. That is spiritual world. That is reality. [break]...ahaṁbrahmāsmi.""Oh, I don't belong to this darkness, darkness atmosphere. I belong to the light atmosphere."" That is self-realization.Ahaṁbrahmāsmi."
Hanumān,...simultaneously in the dream and not in the dream. So when...,Prabhupāda,"That is reality, when you are chantingHareKṛṣṇa. That is reality."
Hanumān,But I also see all this.,Prabhupāda,"Eh? That is another thing. On the path of reality, you come."
Hanumān,On the path?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. It is a process. When the process is complete, then you'll come to the reality. But that is the process.Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12].We cannot distinguish now reality and non-reality because the heart is unclean. So we have to cleanse, and then we come to the reality."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:For that matter, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when one comes to that stage, there is no difference between animate and inanimate. Is that true?",Prabhupāda,Highest stage?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Highest stage, everything animate."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes. So a stone... Even a stone has soul.,Prabhupāda,"Oh yes, yes. Just like this tree. You cut; it does not protest. The consciousness is not developed. That is the... But it has got life. You scientists, you do not believe that stone has also life?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:No, they say it's just matter.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They say there's no life there.,Prabhupāda,"No, there is life."
Nitāi,Every stone has life?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. No, dead stone has no... But there are many mountains, they are increasing. You know, at Benares there is a stone?Tila-bandhesvara.(?)"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:I don't know.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That increases. If you go, see today, and go ten years after, you'll see—take the measurement—it has increased. They'll go..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But they will say that because of the position of the dust particles the size will increase. Even a small...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. It is clean. There is no... It is being washed even. Its name isTila-bandhesvara.(?) So there is no uncleanliness. Still, the body increases. There is stillTila-bandhesvara.(?) There is temple ofTila-bandhesvara.People go to see."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But the consciousness is covered there.,Prabhupāda,"Covered, yes. Dullness means consciousness is covered. You put a child in open air. He'll not feel much cold. You see practically. He'll not feel. Because consciousness is not developed. Animal, they will not feel cold. But we feel."
Bahulāśva:,"Bahulāśva:But Prabhupāda, there are still such things as dead matter?",Prabhupāda,Not dead matter. The soul is there.
Bahulāśva:,"Bahulāśva:Suppose something, well, something like this shoe that I'm wearing...,",Prabhupāda,"It is now dead matter. But when you go, the higher understanding, it is a composition of atoms. So we learn from Vedicśāstrathat within the atom there is life.Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁgovindamādi-puruṣaṁtamahaṁbhajāmi[Bs.5.35].There is, there. If within the atom there is life, then what to speak of anything else."
Bahulāśva:,Bahulāśva:That's ajīvātmā?,Prabhupāda,"No, no.Govindais there."

Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:...water is tasteless, butKṛṣṇasays, ""I am the taste in water."" Science says water is tasteless, no taste in water.",Prabhupāda,Science says.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,But have you tasted that tasteless water? (laughter)
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They'll say the taste of water depends on the amount of chemicals contained in the water.,Prabhupāda,That's all right. So that isKṛṣṇa. That isKṛṣṇa. The tastefulness. Tastefulness of water isKṛṣṇa. Not the water.
Gurukṛpā:,"Gurukṛpā:Prabhupāda, the other day you mentioned that during the eating activities, during sex activity, there is increase of breathing.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Gurukṛpā:,"Gurukṛpā:Now, when we do thekīrtana,there is much increase of breathing. So what is the difference?",Prabhupāda,The difference is that... [Break] ...why your child is less conscious than yourself?
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:Because he's not developed.,Prabhupāda,"He's also living entity. Why he's foolish, and why you are intelligent? What is the answer?"
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:Because the consciousness is more developed.,Prabhupāda,Then develop... So you develop your consciousness. Then you will understandKṛṣṇa.
Gurukṛpā:,Gurukṛpā:So I must be more fortunate than the other living entities in my body.,Prabhupāda,Eh?

Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:By nature.,Prabhupāda,"Then you come to somebody. That is foolishness. Then nature is not ultimate.Kṛṣṇais the ultimate. Because you cannot seeKṛṣṇa, therefore you say, ""Nature."""

Otherwise why in this old age we are trying so much?
