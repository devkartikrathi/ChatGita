Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:ParamBrahman.,Prabhupāda,"ParamBrahman. We are all Brahmans.Ahaṁbrahmāsmi.Every one of us, living entity,Brahman. But He is the chiefBrahman. Just like you are all Americans, but your president is the chief American. Do you understand? So similarly,Kṛṣṇais the chiefBrahman. You are allBrahman, but He is the chiefBrahman. Is it clear? That's all right. [Break] ...that ""This boy hears very nicely. He does not go away,"" the first impression he gave to other godbrothers. ""So I shall make him disciple."" These very words he said. Actually I did not follow him in the beginning. High philosophical speaking and I was a new boy. I could not follow him, but actually I was so much glad to hear him. That's all. So that was my qualification, whatever you may say. I was simply asking, ""WhenGuruMahārājawill speak? When he will speak? When?"" And I will sit down and go on hearing, and I will understand or not understand-others will disperse—I will not disperse. That he marked. Yes. First. There was first one instance. At that time I was not initiated. There was a circumambulation of wholeVṛndāvana. So although I was not initiated, I was one of the important members of the... So I thought, ""Let me go. What these people are doing, circumambulating all overVṛndāvana?"" So I went toMathurā. Then I went to theVṛndāvanainterior, which place was known as Kosi. So in that Koṣi one of my godbrothers declared that ""Prabhupāda is going tomorrow back toMathurā. So he will speak this evening. So anyone who wants to hear him, they can stay. And others may prepare to..."" Sit down."
Pradyumna,Two people just came.,Prabhupāda,Oh. All right.
Pradyumna,Can the boys downstairs bring them?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So they were to go to see some other temple which is called Śeṣayī Temple. So although I was new man, I did not like to go to see the Śeṣayī Temple. I decided that ""I shall hear."" So at that time I was new, so all other, some of my important godbrothers, they were sitting like this, and I was sitting. At last, you see. But he knew that ""This boy is new."" Everyone has gone, all others except a few selected godbrothers. So he marked it that ""This boy is interested to hear me."" So hearing is very important. Hearing. Just likeArjunaheard fromKṛṣṇa. Come on. (People entering) [Break] ...because I was serious for hearing, and therefore now I am serious aboutkīrtanaṁ,means speaking, or preaching. Do you follow what I say? Yes. So one who is serious about hearing, he can become a future nice preacher.Śravaṇaṁkīrtanaṁ.Next stage is developed. That is development. If one has actually heard nicely, then he will speak nicely.Śravaṇaṁkīrtanaṁsmaraṇaṁ.Then consciousness will automatically develop because when you speak or you hear, unless your mind is concentrated, your consciousness is right, you cannot rightly hear or speak.Śravaṇaṁkīrtanaṁsmaraṇaṁpāda-sevanam.And then the development, ""How I shall serveKṛṣṇa?Kṛṣṇais so loving.Kṛṣṇais so great,"" that automatically comes. Not silent, but activity.Pāda-sevanammeans that activity begins immediately. In this way last item issarvātma-snapanaṁ.Sarvātma,ātma-samarpaṇam,sarvātma-samarpaṇam.BaliMahārājajust like. Giving, giving, giving, giving, giving, giving. Then, when Vamanadeva asked, ""Now,BaliMahārāja, you have lost everything. Still I have got another leg, another foot, to place."" ""Yes. There is one thing. It is my head. Come on."" So everything is there, and Lord Vamanadeva: ""Yes. You have now purchased Me. You have now purchased Me. So I shall remain your doorman here, standing always to give you protection."" SoKṛṣṇabecame purchased by him, and He remained his doorman. Just see His mercy.Dvārā.Dvārī.Dvārimeans doorman. So by servingKṛṣṇa, nobody is loser; he is gainer. He is gainer permanently, eternally. We do not know what is the value of that gain now. Because we are materially covered, we think service means just like service in this world. This service ismāyā.Nobody will be satisfied, nobody. You cannot satisfy, neither you will be satisfied. The best example is in your country, that your president, Mr. Kennedy, he gave you the best service, and the result was that you killed him. You or some of your member killed him. That means his service was not appreciated, although he gave his best service. So similarly, in the material world, whatever service you render, that is spoiling time. But you render service toKṛṣṇa—you will be satisfied,Kṛṣṇawill be satisfied, and asKṛṣṇawill be satisfied, everyone will be satisfied. So take to thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness service by hearing, by speaking, by remembering, by giving actually service, by worshiping, by making friendship, and after all, everything forKṛṣṇa. That is perfection. Now these new boys have come. Let them question and I shall answer. That will be nice. You have heard something aboutKṛṣṇaconsciousness? So wherefrom these men ...? (indistinct)"
Pradyumna,Bhurijana sent them. Bhurijana sent money for tickets to go to Columbus.,Prabhupāda,He has sent the tickets?
Pradyumna,Money.,Prabhupāda,"Hm. So engage all yourselves in the service ofKṛṣṇa. It is very pleasing, and what is called encouraging, enlivening. After too much material enjoyment, the next stage is frustration. That stage is coming to your country. Therefore the boys are becoming hippies. After too much material enjoyment, the next stage is—that is natural-frustration. There is a good example in our country, one Mr. C.R. Das. He was a great leader, next toGandhi, important political leader. So he was on the topmost of... He was lawyer, barrister. He was earning fifty thousand dollars monthly, very rich man. And he was making charity, and he was spending like thing (anything). He was drunkard number one, woman-hunter number one, and everything. Because he had money he could enjoy everything. But he was not happy. So one day he was sitting with his wife. Just like in the street, he was looking over. So his wife asked him—his name was Chittaranjan—""Chittaranjan, you are earning so much. You are spending. People are very much fond of you. You are a great leader. Why you always remain morose? What do you want to be? You have got now everything."" So at that time one mendicant, asannyāsīwas passing. So Chittaranjan said, ""I want to be like him. Then I will be happy. I don't want to enjoy. I want to beggar, to be beggar-like."" You see? So that time is coming to your country. So these hippies, they are frustrating. They have given up everything. We can study their psychic movement. They are not satisfied. That is the main principle. That is natural, to accept adversity voluntarily, adversity. So this is frustration. But before reaching to that point of frustration, if you take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then you reach the real standard of happiness because everything belongs toKṛṣṇa. I shall give you another example. Suppose you have stolen something from somebody's house or some friends. You will not be happy, even possessing that thing, stolen property. But if someday you come to return that thing to that friend, you will be happy. What do you think,Hayagrīva?"
Hayagrīva,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Then you will feel relieved. So therefore the real thing is that everything belongs toKṛṣṇa. We are artificially enjoying the stolen property. Therefore if you go on enjoying like that, then this frustration will come. But before coming to that frustration, if we return this property toKṛṣṇa, then we become happy. So best thing is to return everything toKṛṣṇa. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. And you will not be a loser. You will be gainer, just likeBaliMahārāja. Actually, if you think, everything belongs toKṛṣṇa. Nothing belongs to you. This ismāyā.Kṛṣṇa's property you are thinking, ""mine."" Is this land of American belongs to you actually? It is stolen property. You have stolen from the Red Indians or fromKṛṣṇa. Everyone is, not you, everyone. Somebody is claiming, ""This much my property,"" somebody is claiming, ""This much my property,"" but this much or that much, everything belongs toKṛṣṇa. It is stolen property. There is another example in Indian words, thathiracauri kiya abhicaurya, khira caurī kiyā abhicaura.Hirameans diamond, andkhīrameans... What is that called? Cucumber, a small? So if somebody has stolen a cucumber from other's tree, so he is captured. And another man has stolen some diamond. He is also arrested. So from the police, both are thieves. If the man says, ""Oh, what I have stolen? I have stolen a little cucumber. It is nothing, worth not even two cent or one cent. Why you are arresting me? He is thief. He has stolen a big diamond,"" no, in the eyes of law, he is also thief; he is also thief. Everyone is thief. Anyone who is not inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, he is thief. He'll not be happy. The best thing is to return whatever he has possessed: ""Kṛṣṇa, it is Yours. Take."" Finish business.Mānasadehageha, yokichumora.Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's song... Now, everything we possess in mind. Actually we don't possess. Suppose I am possessing all this. As soon as I go from this body, all possession will remain here. I'll not take anything. So I don't possess. But in mind I am thinking, ""Oh, this is mine. This is mine. Where is another box? Why it is not coming?"" And possessing in mind. If I leave this body, either the box here or in the Chicago or anywhere else, what is the difference? There is no difference. But because I am possessing in the mind, ""Oh, that box is mine,"" so I am asking, ""Whether it is Chicago or it is here, it is there? Why it is not coming?"" So possession in the mind. Actually you don't possess.Mānasadehageha.So by that supposingly possessing, we have got our mind, we have got our body, then expansion of body, wife, children, family, society, country. In this way we possess so many things. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says,mānasadehageha, yokichumora:""Now whatever I possess, either in the mind or in the family or in the society or in the body—whatever I have got, I surrender unto You, my dearKṛṣṇa.""Mānasadehageha, yokichu..., arpilun tuāpadenandakiśora: ""Nanda-kiśora,O the son ofNanda, I give unto You.""Marobi rakhobi, yoicchātohāra:""Now whatever You like, You can do, either you kill me or You protect me, as You like. You are the proprietor. You have right to do everything."" This is surrender. This is fullKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is not possible immediately. Therefore we have to practice.Sadātad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ[Bg.8.6].And if we die in thatKṛṣṇaconsciousness,yaṁyaṁvāpismaranloketyajatyantekalevaram...In the particular type of consciousness, when one gives up this body, then he is transferred into that position next life. So in this way,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, if we are able,sadātad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ, by practicing always, constantly, that situation of consciousness, then next life, after giving up... Why next life? This life also. One person who is in always Kṛṣṇa's service this life or that life, he is withKṛṣṇa. He is withKṛṣṇa. Any person who is inKṛṣṇaconsciousness is always withKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇais everywhere. I may not understand, butKṛṣṇais everywhere. So you American boys and girls, you should take to thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. You'll be happy. Your position is to take up because you are on the top of the material happiness. Now you take it. You be saved. Otherwise this frustration is coming. That will come. Just like C.R. Das. He, out of that frustration, he gave up everything. He sacrificed his life for political. And what is the value of that sacrifice? You may become a great man of your country in the estimation of your people, but not in the estimation ofKṛṣṇa. You may become a great man in the estimation of your country, but in others' estimation, your enemy, ""Oh, this man is dead. Now our enemy is finished. That's nice."" So another side there is imperfection. Not everybody is satisfied by your service. But if you serveKṛṣṇa, everybody is satisfied. If you chantHareKṛṣṇaand dance, nobody will be dissatisfied. At least they will say, ""Ah..."" Just like in the paper, ""The boys are very nice."" You see? You have seen. Instead of not very sympathetic, they have remarked this, ""Oh, these boys are very nice."" At least, people will appreciate, ""Oh, these boys are... TheseKṛṣṇaconscious men are very nice. They do not smoke. They do not drink. They have no illicit sex life. They do not kill for satisfy the tongue. They are satisfied with natural food. And their behavior is very good."" Who will deny it? And the other asset they cannot estimate, that how much he is in contact withKṛṣṇa, the Supreme. That, they have no estimating power, but at least they will appreciate these external features. One clergyman, when I was going to Hawaii, he was talking with me. He said, ""Swamiji, I have seen your disciples have a very nice face, glowing face."" And ""Yes, certainly. They must be. They are making spiritual progress."" So it is not difficult. It is very easy. If you take to this, you have everything sublime and your life becomes sublime. You haven't got to give up anything. The material needs are there, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. That is not disallowed, but adjusted forKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We cannot allow eating, mating, like animals, cats and dogs. No. That is not possible. You'll eat, you'llmate, but just like human being, civilized man. Then what is the distinction between animal and man if we behave like animals?Kṛṣṇa, God, is pure. So if you keep yourself in impure condition of life, then how you can make progress towards purity, highest perfection, purity?Paraṁbrahmaparaṁdhāmapavitraṁparamaṁbhavān[Bg.10.12].In the Tenth Chapter ofBhagavad-gītāArjunais acceptingKṛṣṇathat ""You are the purest of all."" If you are going to reach the purest of all, how you can remain impure? Thistapasya...This voluntary restraint meanstapasya.Tapasya,there is a Sanskrit word,tapasya.Tapasyameans voluntarily restraining or accepting some suffering condition. That is not actually suffering condition. Just like a patient. A doctor says, ""You cannot take it."" So he has the desire to take it, but doctor says that ""you cannot take it."" Therefore he mentally thinks that ""Doctor has restricted this. I am suffering."" Actually he is curing, but he thinks that ""I am suffering."" And when he's cured, he sees, ""Oh, doctor is good friend. He told me not to indulge in this. Now I have done it. I am now cured."" Sotapasyameans voluntarily one has to accept some so-called suffering. That is required to make advancement inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, voluntarily acceptance, some so-called suffering.Tapaḥdivyam.That suffering is for transcendental realization. That is good.Tapodivyaṁyenasattvaṁśuddhyet[SB5.5.1]. Śuddhyetmeans your existence will be purified. And existence purified means you advance to real"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Would you say something about Christ and his relation toKṛṣṇaconsciousness? Christ? Jesus Christ?,Prabhupāda,"Christ isKṛṣṇaconscious. That's all. You become like Christ,Kṛṣṇaconscious. Don't you understand Christ, that he is fullyKṛṣṇaconscious? You don't understand it? Then you become like Christ, fullyKṛṣṇaconscious."
Madhumaṅgala:,Madhumaṅgala:What does Madhumaṅgala mean?,Prabhupāda,That is not very good question.
Madhumaṅgala:,Madhumaṅgala:(indistinct)...told me to ask.,Prabhupāda,"Madhumaṅgala, you have explained when I initiated. Madhumaṅgala was one of the friend ofKṛṣṇa. That's all."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):What was Arjuna's relation toKṛṣṇa, I mean, as concise as you can put it?",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:What was Arjuna's relationship toKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,"Friendship. That is also... There are five kinds of relationship. Just like ""God is great."" That is simply feeling the greatness of God. Then, when he feels exactly how God is great, then naturally there will be an inclination to serve God. That is called servitude. First neutrality estimation... That is calledśānta-rasa,neutral, no activity but simply appreciating, ""God is great,"" simply appreciation. And then servitude. When the appreciation is complete, ""Oh, why not serve God? He is so great. He is giving us so many things. Let me return something. Let me do some service of Him."" Servitude. That is further development of the appreciation of the greatness of God. And then further development is friendship. Friendship means... Service means I ask you, ""Please give me a glass of water."" You give me. And friendship means you are thinking, ""How my friend will be... Now he may be wanting a glass of water."" So before asking me, if you give me, ""I think you may require a glass of water,"" that is friendship. Friendship means feeling friend's welfare always.Suhṛt.Friendship is not simply chatting. Friendship means thinking, ""How my friend will be happy?"" This is friendship. Then that friendship, when further developed, that is parenthood. Just like parents, they have no other consideration. They want to see, ""How my child will be happy always?"" And further development is conjugal love, just like man and woman, male and female, that love. That love includes everything—that appreciation of greatness, that servitude of service, the friendship, then maternal love, and further, offering everything for the lover. That is most perfectional stage of love. So in this way we have got five kinds of direct relationship, and there are seven kinds of indirect relationship. That is not on the platform of love. That is on the platform of enmity. Just likeKaṁsa.Kaṁsawas thinking ofKṛṣṇaas enemy, so he was alsoKṛṣṇaconscious. He was thinking of how to killKṛṣṇa. So that is alsoKṛṣṇaconsciousness, but indirectly. So there are, indirect, sevenrasas:ghastly, inimical, and sometimes seeingKṛṣṇa, one laughs, derided... In so many ways there are many indirect... Without relationship nobody can remain. The seven kinds of relationship are indirect. And five kinds of relationship is direct. So we want to be situated in the direct relationship."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:All of the conditioned souls are in an indirect relationship.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:Everyone is in a relationship.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. There must be some relation. Without relationship one cannot exist because he is part and parcel. Just like persons in the prison house. They are not out of government. There is relationship with the government, but that is indirect. The criminals, they do not appreciate the service of the government. Government is bothered about his existence. Some extra... Instead of receiving some service from him to the state, the state has got to spend unnecessarily for him. That is a botheration. So those who are in indirect relationship withKṛṣṇa, they are botheration. They are simply giving trouble toKṛṣṇa, but there is relationship."
Hayagrīva,Is the humorous direct or indirect? One in humor?,Prabhupāda,"Humor, humor is practically in every direct relationship. And indirect also, there is humor. ""I am thinking of you as enemy""—that is also another type of humor. (Chuckles) Yes."
Pradyumna,Do the five directrasastake place betweenjīvasouls also when they are...,Prabhupāda,"Everything forjīvasouls, all relationship.Kṛṣṇais one, the Supreme, and all thejīvasouls are part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa. Therefore the eternal relationship is there. Now they are exhibited in these twelve kinds of humor, either directly or indirectly.Jīvasoul, a part and parcel, cannot be separated from the Supreme. Sun and the light, electric bulb, and the diffusion of light, they cannot be separated. But this portion is covered. It appears darkness. So when it is covered, that is calledmāyā,and he thinks that ""I have no relationship with God,"" or ""I am God,"" ""There is no God."" This ismāyā.He is covered. He cannot see. So he has to be treated by thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness treatment, and themāyāwill be separated, and he will see, ""Ah, yes, I am part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa."" Then he comes to the direct relationship. Anyone, so-called spiritualist or transcendentalist, if he is claiming that ""There is no God,"" ""I am God,"" ""There is voidness,"" these are all disturbing positions, different symptoms of this disease ofmāyā.It is disease. How one can think of, that he is God? That means he does not know what is God. If I say here that ""I am President Nixon,"" would you accept it? Would you accept? Any one of you, if I say that ""I am President Nixon,"" will you accept? Why? Why? Why? Why you do not accept me? I say, ""I am President Nixon."" Why do you not accept? Why?"
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:You don't have the characteristics.,Prabhupāda,"No. That means you are not rascal. You are sane, that you do not accept me as President... That is one thing. At least you are not insane. So if I say, ""God,"" and you accept, then how much insane you are. Just try to understand. How much insanity is there, one who is claiming that ""I am God"" and one who is accepting that he is God. This is insanity."
Woman:,Woman:Are we not all one?,Prabhupāda,One is... That is different thing. You are not one with President Nixon?
Woman:,Woman:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Then are you President Nixon?
Woman:,Woman:He's a human being. He's part of me.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. He is American. He is human being. In so many qualities you are one. But you cannot claim for that, you are President Nixon. You should understand in that way. In so many respect, qualities, you are one with God, but that does not mean you are God. God is one. That means you have no complete understanding. Just like in spite of your becoming American or human being, you deny to identify yourself with President Nixon because you have full knowledge of President Nixon and yourself. And as soon as you say, ""I am God,"" that means you have no full knowledge of God. You are insane. You do not know what is God. That very thing immediately asserts that you are unknown factor about God. God is said, ""Great,"" but you are claiming that greatness. That means you do not know how great He is. A tiny factor, you are claiming that ""I am God,"" without having that greatness. That means insane, insanity. The same way: if you claim that ""I am President Nixon,"" that is insanity. Similarly, God is, how great He is, how much greater than President Nixon. You deny to become one with President Nixon, and you accept to be one with God? How much insane you are. Just try to understand. Yes?"
Child:,Child:How many arms does Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva have?,Prabhupāda,That you shall know later on. Not now.
Janārdana,"I've read inBhagavad-gītāthat he who knows the self does not do action nor causes action to be done. So what is the soul's, the spirit soul's, relationship to actions performed both in material consciousness and in spiritual, inKṛṣṇaconsciousness?",Prabhupāda,"Material consciousness means forgetting God. When one forgets God, that is material consciousness. Material consciousness is calledmāyā.Actually one should not forget. But if he forgets somehow or other, that is material consciousness. Naturally nobody forgets his father and mother. But if, somehow or other, he forgets, that is a special circumstances and that is calledmāyā,illusion. Just like any one of you who are existing, you must have a father and mother. That is a fact. Without father and mother, your existence cannot be. Now, if you cannot say who is your father and mother, if you do not know, this forgetfulness, this is calledmāyā.Actually it should not happen, but somehow or other, if you are asked, ""Who is your parents?"" You cannot say. This is calledmāyā.But there must be some father and mother. Without father and mother, there cannot be an existence. You cannot deny that. You cannot say, ""Oh, I have no father and mother."" That is not possible. You may not know who is your father, mother. That is a different thing. But you cannot say, ""Oh, I have no father, mother."" So this denial, that ""I don't believe in God,"" is a existence like that, one who has forgotten his father and mother. That ismāyā,and that is material consciousness. Denying God in different way, ""There is no God,"" that is also denial. ""I don't believe in God""—that is also denial. ""God is impersonal, void,"" anyway, whatever you say in that way, that is all insanity,māyā.Mayameans insanity. Another meaning ofmāyāmeans insanity. Just like when a man becomes insane, that is false. It is expected that he should not be insane. By treatment he is brought again to his original consciousness. Similarly,māyāmeans insanity, forgetfulness of God. And byKṛṣṇaconsciousness treatment he comes to the original consciousness. He becomes a cured man. Actuallymāyāmeans which has no existence.Māyāhas no existence. But sometimes it is there. Just like the sky's cover. This covering is not reality. The reality is this sky, clear sky, but somehow it is now covered. You cannot see the clear sky. So there is temporary, temporary illusion. Now, if I see the cloud only and if I say, ""Oh, there is no sun. There is no illumination,"" or ""There is no clear sky,"" that is insanity. Because I cannot see-under certain circumstances, I deny it—that is my insanity. Therefore you have to approach to a man who knows that there is sunlight, there is sun, there is clear sky... If you go there... You require all this education, knowledge. By knowledge one transcendsmāyā,or material existence. What is the difference between ordinary man andKṛṣṇaconscious man? They are also living in this world, in this apartment. Everything is being utilized like others. We are also eating, sleeping also. But what is the difference? Our difference—that we accept that everything belongs toKṛṣṇa; others do not. That's all. That ismāyā.Everything actually belongs toKṛṣṇa. He does not know. He thinks, ""It belongs to me,"" or ""This, my nation, this, my country, this, that,"" so many things. He is manufacturing. And we know the simple truth, that everything belongs toKṛṣṇa. So let everything be offered toKṛṣṇa. That's all. Yes."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:So we understand that in the material consciousness the living entity is being forced to act.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:His actions are quite automatic under the laws of material nature.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. No, action is there. Because you are living entity, you are active."
Kīrtanānanda:,"Kīrtanānanda:Yes, but they are being dictated.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Just like a man in fever talking nonsense. So that is due to fever.
Kīrtanānanda:,"Kīrtanānanda:InKṛṣṇaconsciousness, are the actions of thejīvasimilarly controlled by Kṛṣṇa's superior energy?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, certainly."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:But everything is being controlled ultimately byKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:Either by inferior energy or superior energy.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Kīrtanānanda:,"Kīrtanānanda:So his activities are never independent, either inKṛṣṇaor...",Prabhupāda,"Never, never, never. That is his insanity, another. As soon as he thinks that ""I am independent,"" that is another insanity. He is under control. Just like the same man. He is thinking, ""I don't care for state laws."" He is insane. He will be forced to accept state laws in the prison house by the police. But he thinks, ""Oh, I am free man."" Still... He is slapped by the police. He says, ""Oh, I am independent. Go on slapping."" This is insanity. Is it not insanity? The police slaps him, and he says, ""I am independent."" Do you think independence? So that sort of independence we are having. We are kicked bymāyāalways, and we are thinking, ""independent."" This is insanity. He does not think, ""Why I am independent? I am servant of my senses. I cannot remain, enjoying senses, for an hour, and I am thinking I am independent."" That means insane. He cannot think properly. Where is his independence? Cannot be independent. He is born dependent because part and parcel of God. His constitutional position is dependent. Just like child. A child declares independence. What is the meaning of that independence? Danger. That's all. Simply inviting dangers. A child wants: ""Oh, I don't care for my parents. I shall cross the road. I shall go everywhere."" So if he is allowed to do that, that means he is simply inviting dangers. And if he remains under the protection of the parents, he is always safe. So this living entity's declaring independence means he is insane, different kinds of insanity. He cannot be independent. Let him think very deeply that it cannot be independent. He is thinking independent of God, but he is dependent on his sense pleasure. That's all. And some intoxication, a voluntarily accept dependence of somethingmāyā.That's all. Who is independent. Is there anyone independent? Nobody is independent. To think of independence ismāyā.Best thing is that ""I am dependent, and let me remain dependent in properly. Then I am protected."" That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So your question is answered? Material consciousness means thinking falsely independent. That is material consciousness. Falsely. He is not independent, but he is thinking falsely, ""I am independent."" This ismāyā.Just like in dream he is falsely thinking there is a tiger. There is no tiger, but he is actuated by this false impression, ""Oh, tiger is eating me. It has attacked me. Save me."" So this material existence means because he is insane, he is thinking there are so many problems, ""The tiger is there. He is attacking me. This, that, so many enemies, friends...,"" creating so many things. But they are all false. But he is attacked by that false hallucination. That's all. This ismāyā.Everyone is thinking, ""Oh, there are so many problems I have to solve. I have to make this, that, this, so many."" But he has no problem. He has no problem. His only problem is how to acceptKṛṣṇa. That's all. AndKṛṣṇais so kind. He says, ""Yes, you accept Me. Simply chantKṛṣṇa. I am yours. That's all."" But my, I am so misfortunate that I cannot chant even. All problems solved simply by chantingKṛṣṇa.Etādṛśītavakṛpābhagavān.CaitanyaMahāprabhuteaches that ""OKṛṣṇa, You are so kind that You have come to Me in the sound vibration, word, 'Kṛṣṇa.' I can very easily chant, and You remain with Me. But I am so misfortunate that I have no attraction even for this."" You say people, ""You chantKṛṣṇa; you get everything."" They will not believe it. If you say, ""You press your nose. You pay me fifty dollars. I'll give you some nicemantraand this, that. You make your head like this, leg like this,"" ""Oh,"" he'll say, ""here is something."" Something. ""And this Swamiji says, 'Simply chantKṛṣṇa.' Oh, what is this?"" ThereforeCaitanyaMahaprabhusaid,etādṛśītavakṛpābhagavānmamāpidurdaiva:""But I am so unfortunate that You have become so easily available in this age, but I am so unfortunate, I cannot accept it."" So theKṛṣṇaconsciousness so easily being distributed, but they are so unfortunate, they cannot accept. Just see. And you give them bluff, you cheat them—they will, ""Ah, yes, welcome. Yes."" They'll welcome it. And cheaters are always ready: ""Oh, there are so many customers for being cheated. Let me take advantage of it."" So myGuruMahārājaused to say, ""This world is the society of cheaters and cheated."" The members are somebody are cheating, and somebody are cheated. The association of cheaters and cheated. So we want to save them from this society of cheaters and cheated."
Janārdana,"Prabhupāda, often when we'll be performing, doing some activity during our day, and so many things will go wrong, and we become frustrated...",Prabhupāda,"Well, when one is a professional, there may be something wrong. That doesn't matter. But you try to discharge your duties, rightly, whatever you are prescribed to do. Then everything will come to the right point. Your only business is to follow the four principles of regulative life and chantHareKṛṣṇasixteen rounds. So there may be sometimes mistake. That will be corrected automatically. Because we are coming from a different platform, so it may be. And that is also said in theBha...Apicetsu-durācārobhajatemāmananya-bhāk, sādhurevasamantavyaḥ:[Bg.9.30] ""If one is found doing mistake or doing something wrong, but because he is sticking to this principle ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, he issādhu.""Sādhumeans a holy man. He is holy. He is not doing any wrong consciously. But due to habit... Suppose just like most of you were, in your former life, you were smoking or taking intoxication. But by some influence, if you sometimes take to it, yes, if you are conscious, ""Oh, I have done wrong,"" but that is excused if you have done unconscious. But if you think that ""Now I amKṛṣṇaconscious. Whatever I do, it is right,"" then it is great sin. But accidentally it happens—that is excused. Never mind. So accidental mistake is not dangerous. Willful mistake is dangerous. That we should be careful. We should be very careful always so that accidental mistakes also may not take place. But if it takes place, it is excused."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Canhaṭha-yogahinder or helpKṛṣṇaconsciousness, or is it...?",Prabhupāda,"Hinder. Yes. Because it is useless, simply wasting time. You cannot performhaṭha-yogain this age. You do not follow the rules and regulations. You are simply bluffed. Do you know what is the rules and regulations ofhaṭha-yogafactually?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Not actually.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You have to select a secluded place.Haṭha-yogais not practiced in assembly of so many men. Just you go to ahaṭha-yogaclass. There are hundreds of members practicing, and he is collecting money, five dollars per seat. And you are thinking, ""I am practicing."" That is useless waste of time and money.Haṭha-yogais not practiced in that way. You have to practice in a secluded place, alone. Do you do that?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Yes. Not... No. I guess I don't.,Prabhupāda,"It is very difficult in this age. Then you have to restrain yourself in so many things. Complete free from sex life. You have to eat under certain direction, you have to... So many things there are. These rules are not followed. Simply they have got some bodily gymnastic sitting posture. They are thinking, ""I am practicing."" No. That is one of the items. So all the items cannot be observed in this age. Therefore it is wasting. [Break] ""...yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service is most intimately united with Me inyogaand is the highest of all."" This is the goal ofyogapractice. So that is possible very easily by this movement,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, not by any other process. And the ultimate goal is here. One should be always abiding with God, worshiping Him, transcendental loving service, and intimately united with Him, intimately. This intimate unity means that five kinds of relationship. That is the perfection ofyoga. WhenKṛṣṇahas advisedyogapractice,sāṅkhya-yoga...You haveBhagavad-gītā?There issāṅkhya-yoga.You'll find in the forty-seventh verse. This is the version."
Devotee:,Devotee:There's no value in keeping the body fit through exercise?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you can become very healthy. But does it mean that health is the perfection of life? Do you mean to say healthy life will not die, will not change his body? So health is required, but health is not the ultimate goal of life. Ultimate goal of life is here."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Buddhataught very similar things to what theGītātaught also, didn't he? Are there agreeances there, agreement in certain places whatBuddhataught and what theGītāteaches?",Prabhupāda,Do you follow thisBuddha?
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Uh, no.",Prabhupāda,"You simply talk of him? You practiceBuddhaif you appreciate him. You give up everything likeBuddhaand meditate. But that you will not do. Then what is the talking of, useless talking about this? Do something. Either you believeBuddhaor Jesus Christ orKṛṣṇa. Do something. Don't talk simply. LordBuddhais very nice. He gave up his kingdom in youthful life. He was prince. He thought, ""It is all nonsense. Let me meditate."" Do like that. That is the disease. We won't do anything. We talk much of this, that, this, that. Do anything, but do it perfectly. ""Jack of all trade, master of none."" That is not good. Be master of something. It doesn't differ. Either you follow Lord Jesus Christ or LordBuddhaorKṛṣṇa, it doesn't matter much. But do it perfectly. That is our request. (end)"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:HareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:So, we will sing tomorrow.",Prabhupāda,Yes. (laughs)
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Is this your first visit here?,Prabhupāda,"The first visit, yes."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:You have the whole house.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. They are doing very nice. (indistinct) We have some meeting in the university,kīrtana.Our..., wherever we gokīrtanaand speaking. You have seen our book,Lord Caitanya's Teaching?"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:No. I haven't seen that. That's new.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Is that...? Er, ISKCON published.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:So, you did... You..., printed where?",Prabhupāda,Japan.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Pardon me?,Prabhupāda,Japan.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Printed inJapan.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Beautiful. It's very industrious. It's marvelous.,Prabhupāda,"Next book is coming,Nectar of Devotion."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:What will that be, your own writings?",Prabhupāda,"No, it is the authorized translation ofRūpaGosvāmī's book,Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Whose...?,Prabhupāda,"RūpaGosvāmī, Lord Caitanya's principal disciple."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Uhuh.,Prabhupāda,"RūpaGosvāmī. There are six Gosvāmīs, direct disciples of LordCaitanya. Er, not, six Gosvāmīs and three other confidential."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"So, our... About the six Gosvāmīs,RūpaGosvāmī is the principal."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:RūpaGos...,Prabhupāda,"RūpaGosvāmī. He was finance minister in the government of Nawab Hussain Shah in Bengal. But when LordCaitanyastarted His movement, he was captivated and he resigned his service, government service and joined Him. And he wrote immense literature, Gosvāmīs. And that Desai was talking that NarottamadāsaṬhākura, he says,rūpa-raghunātha-padehaibeākutikabehāmabujhabaseyugala-pīriti:conjugal love ofRādhāandKṛṣṇa, one can understand when they go through the literatures presented by these Gosvāmīs. So his first book isBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.Devotion of,Nectar of Devotion.That is very authorized book. Quotation from various Vedic literature aboutRādhā-Kṛṣṇaand the different stages of relationship withKṛṣṇa,śānta-rasa,dāsya-rasa,admiration. God is Great. This is also one stage, appreciating the greatness of God. Then further development,dāsya-rasa,willing to serve. Oh! God is so great, and I must serve service because everyone of us are serving somebody. So why not serve the Supreme? Nobody is free from service because we are constitutionally the servant. Either we become the servant of the Great ormāyā.Just like in any condition of our lives, we have to abide by the laws of the state. If he says that we don't abide then come to prisonhouse. You will be forced. Similarly,māyāandKṛṣṇa. If we don't abide byKṛṣṇa, then come tomāyā.He cannot be free. That is not our position. Freedom is frustration."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Do you remember a man named Richard Alpert?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Do you remember of a man named Richard Alpert? He used to work with Timothy Leary.,Prabhupāda,Ah.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:In Harvard many years ago. And then he went to India and found a teacher, and is now a disciple of Hanumānji or a devotee ofHanumān. And he said that, we were talking aboutmāyāand the present condition of America...",Prabhupāda,Have some fruits?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:In a while. Well, we can talk as...",Prabhupāda,Accha.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Bite your food. I have that question I wanted to asked. Are you tired?,Prabhupāda,"No, no. I can talk with you whole night. (laughter)"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:So he said that his teacher in India told him that LSD was a Christ of theKali-yugafor Westerners.,Prabhupāda,Christ?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:of theKali-yugafor Westerners in that, as theKali-yugagot more intense, as attachment got thicker and thicker, that also salvation would have to be easier and easier, and that...",Prabhupāda,(aside:) (Bengali)
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Namaste.(to Indian lady),Prabhupāda,She is a Bengali lady recently come from London.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Ahh!,Prabhupāda,Lekha. (Bengali)
Indian Lady:,Indian Lady:(Bengali),Prabhupāda,(Bengali)
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:So, as theKali-yugabecame more intense and as attachment became deeper and more confusing...",Prabhupāda,Attachment for?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:...that salvation would also have to become easier and easier in theKali-yuga.,Prabhupāda,"That is very nice statement that in theKali-yugasalvation is very easier. That is the version ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamalso, but that process is thiskīrtana,not LSD."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, it was... The reasoning there, was that for those who would only accept salvation in purely material form, in chemical form finally, and completely material form...",Prabhupāda,Hmm. So where is the salvation when there is...
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:...thatKṛṣṇahad the humor to emerge as a pill.,Prabhupāda,"No, the thing is that any of these material forms..."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes?,Prabhupāda,...then where it is salvation? It is illusion.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Well the subjective effect is to cut...,Prabhupāda,No.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:...attachment during the...,Prabhupāda,"Well, if you have got attachments for something material, then where is the cut-off attachment. LSD is a material chemical."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"So if you have to take shelter of LSD then you take, I mean to say, help from the matters, so that is... How you can... How you are free from matter?"
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, the subjective experience is, while in the state of intoxication of LSD, also realizing that LSD is a material pill, and that it does not really matter.",Prabhupāda,So that is risky. That is risky.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yeah. Now so, if LSD is a material attachment, which it is I think, then is not the sound,śabda,also a material attachment?",Prabhupāda,"No,śabdais spiritual. Originally just like in Bible there is, ""Let there be creation."" This sound, this spiritual sound. Creation. Creation was not there. The sound produced the creation. Therefore, sound is originally spiritual and through the sound; sound—from sound, sky develops; from sky, air develop; from air, fire develop; fire, water develop; from water, land develop."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Sound is the first element of creation?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:What was the first sound, traditionally?",Prabhupāda,"Vedic states,Oṁ.So at least we can understand from your Bible, that God said, ""Let there be creation."" So this is sound, and there is creation. God and His sound is non-different, absolute. I say, ""Mr. Ginsberg,"" this sound and I, a little difference, but God is non-different from His energy,nitya...How it is called?Śakti śaktimator abhedhaḥ. Śakti,energy andśakti-mat,the energetic. They are non-different. Just like fire and heat, they are non-different, but heat is not fire. You can not differentiate heat from fire, or fire from heat. But fire is not heat."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well the sounds, the soundkṛṣṇa...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, is non-different fromKṛṣṇa."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:...is not different fromKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"No. Therefore, this soundkṛṣṇa..."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Under all circumstances?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, all, all circumstances, but it is the question of my appreciation, or my realization. That will depend on my purity. Otherwise thisKṛṣṇasound andKṛṣṇa, non-different. Therefore if we vibrate soundKṛṣṇa, then I am immediately in contact withKṛṣṇa, and ifKṛṣṇais whole spirit, then immediately I become spiritualized. Just like if you touch electricity, immediately you're electrified. And the more you become electrified, more you become Kṛṣṇized. Kṛṣṇized. So when you are fully Kṛṣṇized, then you are in theKṛṣṇaplatform.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmetikaunteya[Bg.4.9],then fully Kṛṣṇized, no more comes back to this material existence. He remains withKṛṣṇa. The impersonalists shall say merging. That is less intelligence. Merging does not mean losing individuality. Just like a green bird enters a green tree; it appears merging, but the bird has not lost his individuality. There is individuality. SimilarlyKṛṣṇasays in the Fourth Chapter, no, Second Chapter that I, you,adyam(?), I and all these people who have assembled; it is not that they did not exist previously neither it is that they'll not exist. That means I, you, and all these persons, they were individual in the past. At the present we see it practically, and in future they'll remain individuals. And individually we are that, in our present existence, everyone of us individual. You have got your individual views, I have got my individual views. We agree on common platform, that is different thing, but we are individual. That is our nature. Therefore there is disagreement sometimes. So the individuality is never lost. But our proposition,bhakti-mārga,is to keep individuality and agree with you."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:To keep...?,Prabhupāda,"And agree with you. Our surrender means we agree withKṛṣṇain everything, although we are individual. IfKṛṣṇasays you have to die, we die; out of love. But we are individual, I can deny ""Why shall I die?"" That reality I have got. Just likeArjunawas asked, ""Now I have taught youBhagavad-gītā,now whatever you like you do,""yathecchasitathākuru[Bg.18.63],""as you like."" He doesn't touch the individuality. ButArjunavoluntarily surrendered: ""Yes,""kariṣyevacanaṁtava[Bg.18.73],""yes, I shall do whatever You ask."" He changed his decision. He decided not to fight, but he agreed, ""Yes,""kariṣyevacanaṁtava.This agreement, this is oneness. Not oneness does not mean mix up homogeneously. No, He keeps his individuality.Kṛṣṇakeeps his individuality,yathecchasitathākuru:""Now whatever you like you do."" He says, ""Yes,""kariṣyevacanaṁtava[Bg.18.73],""I shall do what you say."" So this is oneness. Not to lose individuality. Because we cannot lose our individuality. We are individually made originally.Kṛṣṇais individual, we are individual, everyone is individual. Merging means merging in that total agreement. That is liberation. Total agreement without any disagreement. And that is the perfection: to keep individuality and agree with God in total agreement. That is perfection. And imperfection so long we are in rebelled condition that is material because one who has a slightest desire of disagreement withKṛṣṇa, he cannot live there. There the only predominant figure isKṛṣṇa. So one who is trained fully to agree withKṛṣṇa, they are accepted as associates.Bhagavad-gītāsays,bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁpradadyate:[Bg.7.19] after many, many births of cultivating knowledge in spiritual life, a fully conversant, wise person surrenders unto Me.Bahūnāṁjanmanaṁante:after many, many births. How he surrenders?Vāsudevaḥsarvamiti:[Bg.7.19] oh!Kṛṣṇais everything. TheVedānta-sūtragives hint,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1],what isBrahmā, what is supreme?Athātobrahmajijñāsā,to inquire aboutBrahmān, the Supreme. The answer isBrahmanis that or He who is the original source of everything. We have to find out who is the original source, so that requires wisdom. So when one is perfectly wise after many, many births, cultured, he sees, ""Ah, here is the original,Kṛṣṇa,""vāsudevaḥsarvamitisamahātmāsudurlabhaḥ[Bg.7.19],thatmahātmā,great soul, is very rare to be seen, who has surrendered. So our... We are giving the shortcut process: what one has to attain after many, many births, we are simply saying is surrender toKṛṣṇa. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That's all. This is the greatest boon or, what is called, greatest reward or contribution to the human society. And if actually one is wise, then he'll take our word that if one has to come to this point after many, many births, thatKṛṣṇais everything,vāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19],to understand, why not accept it immediately?"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Do you take rebirth in human form literally?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:As a...,Prabhupāda,What is the difficulty?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I just don't remember having been born before.,Prabhupāda,"You don't remember your childhood that does not mean you had no childhood. Do you remember when you were so small boy, what did you did?"
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Certain things. Not very small, but there.",Prabhupāda,Or when you were in your womb of your mother. Do you remember?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:No.,Prabhupāda,"Then, does it mean that you are not."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:No, it doesn't mean that I am not.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. You do not remember, that is not reason. That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yes, but I have really never seen or heard any, anything but what I see in here now. What I see in here is what I can remember is what I can remember. I don't, I've never heard any reasonable or, or even drawing description of previous incarnations, or previous births.",Prabhupāda,You have never heard?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Of, I've never heard anything sensible sounding about it, anything that actually makes me think, ""Ah, that must be.""",Prabhupāda,Is it not sensible?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Not really, no. (laughs)",Prabhupāda,Why not?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Sensible, touchable.",Prabhupāda,"Now, suppose, not suppose, it's a fact: your body in the mother's womb in the first day."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"Of the father, mother sex life, it comes just like the pea many diverse. So from the pea you have come to this point. So body is changing. So what is the astonishment if you change this body, again become, take another pea form. What is the difficulty to understand?"
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, the difficulty to understand would be any permanent being; to understand that there is any permanent being or any continuity of any form of consciousness from one body to another.",Prabhupāda,"Then you have to consult. Therefore you have to take, just like when you can not understand something, we consult some great authority. Is it not?"
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Not enough to make me dream of it at night, no. Not enough to make me love it. Words are not enough. That authority is not enough to make me love it.",Prabhupāda,You don't accept authority?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Not enough to love.,Prabhupāda,"No, love, apart from love."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Not enough to...,Prabhupāda,Consult.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:...going to accept authority. It's just that...,Prabhupāda,"Consult, consult."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I can't even understand an authority that says that I am there when I don't feel myself there.,Prabhupāda,"Well, suppose when you are in some legal trouble, you go to lawyer. You cannot understand. Why do you say you cannot understand? Where you have disease where do you go to a physician. You see? Authority you accept."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:In America we've had a great deal of difficulty with authority.,Prabhupāda,"No that is, that is..."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:No, here is a special problem.",Prabhupāda,"That is, that is, I mean to say, misunderstanding. Authority we have to. The child has to accept authority. Always ask mother what is this father, what is this...? Why? That is the beginning: ask, ask, ask. That is the way of acquiring knowledge.Tadvijñānārthaṁsa...The Vedic injunction is there, if you want to understand that science, you must to go toguru."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:But do you understand your previous lives from the descriptions in authoritative texts, or from any introspective recollection...",Prabhupāda,"No, we have to corroborate."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:...of your own?,Prabhupāda,"Corroborate. Just like in theBhagavad-gītā,it is said thatśucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgeheyoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate[Bg.6.41].One who could not finish thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness, he gets birth in two places, either in very rich family, or in a very purebrāhmaṇafamily, brahminical cultured family. So from my life I experience, when I was very little child six or seven years old, I was very much fond ofKṛṣṇa. And I got the opportunity of this two things. Although my father was not very rich, but he was pureVaiṣṇava.He was great devotee of LordKṛṣṇa."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I assume Calcutta.,Prabhupāda,"In Calcutta, and accidentally, I was born in a very rich family. You have seen that picture in my Calcutta, dancing. In that, there is a Kashi Mallik's family."
Indian Woman:,Indian Woman:(Bengali) Kashi Malliker?,Prabhupāda,"They are very aristocratic family. I do, I did not belong to that family, but I was born in that family, you see? And from the very beginning the Kashi Mallik, they have got niceRādhā-Kṛṣṇatemple. So I was standing before the deity, and I was seeing, ""Oh, He isKṛṣṇa. Oh, people say He is dead. How he is dead?"" Like that I was thinking. And then my, I asked my father, ""Oh, I shall worshipKṛṣṇa, give me."" So my father gave meRādhā-Kṛṣṇa, so I, whatever I was eating, I was offering them. So the statement of theśāstraand my practical experience corroborates. So we we have to take instance like that, you see?Sādhuśāstraguruvākya.We have to test everything from three positions: the spiritual master, scripture, and holy man. Scripture means, just like Bible. What is Bible? Scripture. Why the scripture? It is fully contains the instruction ofsādhu,holy man, or spiritual master, Lord Jesus Christ, therefore is scripture. The scripture means the statement of liberated holy man. That issādhu.Therefore, scripture should be tested through the holy man and spiritual master. Spiritual master should be tested through scripture and holy man, and holy man should be tested through spiritual master and scripture."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:What is the difference between holy man and spiritual master?,Prabhupāda,"No difference, but one has to test whether he is holy man. Then you have to, he has to corroborate with the statement of the scripture. Spiritual master is to be tested whether he is holy man, and whether there is corroboration in the statement of the scriptures.Sādhuśāstraguruvākyatinete koriyaaikya.Just like the law court, the experienced lawyer's speaking and giving evidence.Sādhu-śāstra,and the judge is giving judgement, ""Here is a statement, here is this lawbook."" He has (indistinct). He also testing, the judge is also testing how the lawyer is speaking, and how it is corroborates to the lawbook. So similarly everything has to be tested in that way. The scripture should be consulted, and we should have to see whether it is corroborated. So we should not accept any man as spiritual master or holy man if he does not corroborate with the statement of the scripture. So we should not accept any man as spiritual master or holy man if he does not corroborate with the statement of the scripture. He's at once rejected."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:How shall we sing tomorrow. Have you thought of an arrangement of the program?,Prabhupāda,As you like.
Hayagrīva,"Good, good.",Prabhupāda,"So, how do you feeling about chanting?"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I have been chanting steadily all along now although I enjoy it more and more.,Prabhupāda,That's all right.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Lately, Peter and I have been chanting together on stages, and lately we have been singingRāghupatiRāghavaRājarāma.Is that part of your canon also?",Prabhupāda,"No. There is no harm, but this chanting ofHareKṛṣṇamantrais recommended in the scripture."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:TheHareKṛṣṇais the most pleasing of the chanting as far as I am concerned. Do we want to do that continuously, for as a complete?",Prabhupāda,That's nice.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Do you want to do that continuously or do you want any other likeGopālaor...,Prabhupāda,I think thisHareKṛṣṇamantrashould be chanted.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:You see, we have two and a half hours.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes.,Prabhupāda,I think in the beginning we should havekīrtana.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"And at the end we should havekīrtana.And in the middle we can speak, you can speak aboutKṛṣṇaConciousness."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I think you'd better speak because you're more eloquent on it and also you understand in the language...,Prabhupāda,I'll speak and you'll also speak.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:You might not like what I say. (laughter),Prabhupāda,"No you say your experience, how you're experiencing. That's all."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes. Okay.,Prabhupāda,Yadyadvibhūtimatsattvaṁ.You have got Kṛṣṇa's blessings upon you. You are not ordinary man.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:I'm not certain that I'm worthy of that, Swamiji.",Prabhupāda,That's all right. But I know that you are not ordinary man.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well... I've only recently stopped smoking, by the way, finally. With that car crash, I quit smoking. But I haven't stopped eating meat. So what is the intelligence of meat?",Prabhupāda,"You remain with us at least for three months and you'll forget your... You remain with us for three months. (laughter) With your associates, you just come toVṛndāvana. We shall live together."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:You have a farm now?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:You have a farm now?,Prabhupāda,Yes. And you'll forget everything. You'll be fullyKṛṣṇaconscious.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:We have a farm also now in upstate New York. There we have vegetarian table also in the farm. We have a cow, goats. But...",Prabhupāda,"From economic point of view, if one man has got a cow and four acres of land, he has no economic problem. That we want to start. He can independently live any part of the world. Simply he must (have) one cow and four acres of land. Let the people be divided with four acres of land and a cow, there will be no economic question. All the factories will be closed."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Four acres, you think?",Prabhupāda,Four acres.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Maybe.,Prabhupāda,"That I am instructing Kīrtanānanda, to show this example in New Vrindaban."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:I hope so.,Prabhupāda,Is it very difficult? Four acres of land per head?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:I just this last night was in Minnesota, which is flat, very fertile, very rich land.",Prabhupāda,Where it is? Which province?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:You can get enough hay for a cow, for...?",Prabhupāda,Fodder. Yes. We grow.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:See we are interested in this problem of minimizing.,Prabhupāda,So let us cooperate.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:So we're also going through a coovy(?)āśramafor poets. A little farm for poets.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Farming, agriculture, that is nice. There is a proverb: agriculture is the noblest profession. Is it not said? Agriculture is noblest, andKṛṣṇawas farmer, His father."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:The cow.,Prabhupāda,"Cow, yes. And in Vedic literature you'll find, a man is... Richness of a man is estimated by the possession of grains and cows.Dhanyena dhanavān.If he has got sufficient quantity grain, then he's to be... Formerly, even still in India, when a daughter is offered to a family, they will go and see how manymorais(?) there are. Grain stock. If he sees that he has five, six, big, big grain stock, then he can... ""Oh, this is nice house."" You see? ""They can feed."" So in India still, the arrangement is that every family has got at least two years grain in stock. You see? And cow at least one dozen. No economic problem. And actually, that is the fact. You keep cows and have sufficient grains, whole economic problem solved. Eating. And sleeping, you can take some wood and four pillars. Of course, in your country it is not..."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:It's very cold.,Prabhupāda,"Very cold. (laughing) India, all the year they are lying on the flat sky."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Formerly, in Europe they were also living."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Man lived this way for 20,000 years, 30,000 years until the 19th Century.",Prabhupāda,"So we have to live that. Plain living, high thinking. The necessities of this bodily existence, that should be minimized and not unhealthy. Healthy. To keep oneself fit. But the time should be utilized-developKṛṣṇaconsciousness, spiritual life. Then his whole problem is solved. Here is the big man."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:Haribol.,Prabhupāda,How many rounds you chant?
Child:,Child:All rounds.,Prabhupāda,Only one round?
Woman:,Woman:All the rounds.,Prabhupāda,"All the rounds? Oh, very nice. He's Mr.Dhari(?). Oh, you did not return?"
Indian Lady:,Indian Lady:(Bengali),Prabhupāda,Śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgehe[Bg.6.41].
Indian Lady:,"Indian Lady:He's so good, because he was so good last time.",Prabhupāda,"Children very easily adopt it. So this is the perfectyogasystem. No artificial education. Spontaneous response, dancing,HareKṛṣṇa. That's all. This is the easiest method. So the greatest contribution to the human society. Do it."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, so tomorrow we'll be doing it. So now, the next question I had in my mind is we'll be doingkīrtana,then language, speech. Then end withkīrtana.",Prabhupāda,"That is alsokīrtana.Kīrtanameanskīrtayati.Glorifying. That iskīrtana.So either you sing musically or you speak devotionally, both of them arekīrtana.Just like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, he continually spoke toMahārājaParīkṣit. That is also state,śrīviṣṇu...śravaṇeparīkṣit, abhavadvaiyāsakiḥkīrtane.Vaiyasaki, the son of Vyāsadeva,SukadevaGosvāmī, he became liberated simply bykīrtane.But what is thatkīrtana?He never played musical way. He simply explainedŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.So this is alsokīrtana.This is calledsaṅkīrtana. Bahubhir militvā kīrtayati.That issaṅkīrtana."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:The chanting issaṅkīrtana.,Prabhupāda,"Chanting, yes.Saṅkīrtana."
Hayagrīva,"The first one would last, what thirty minutes? Forty minutes? Thirty, forty minutes?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Forty, forty-five. At least, half an hour beginning."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Okay. At least half an hour.,Prabhupāda,"Last also, half an hour. One hour. And? You have got time? Two hours?"
Hayagrīva,"Oh, as long as you want. Nobody's going to be using that auditorium.",Prabhupāda,"Then make it one hour speaking and one hourkīrtana.Or one half hourkīrtana,one hour speaking."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yeah, well, half will stay. Then the other thing is what tune to use in thekīrtanas?I use several tunes.",Prabhupāda,That as you like.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:What I think might be a good idea is, would it be possible to have the devotees start on the stage, and then if it looks like the audience is not singing vivaciously enough, have the devotees go out and sing... Walk up and down singing?",Prabhupāda,"When the audience joins, that will be very nice."
Hayagrīva,"That's for sure. But there've been... See what you think of various melodies. We play various melodies and see how we can come out. Another thing, do you want to have responsive chanting?",Prabhupāda,Responsive chanting must be there.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:That would be interesting, yes.",Prabhupāda,Otherwise everyone will become tired and that will be chaotic. Response. That's nice. Then the audience will respond.
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:Why don't you lead?,Prabhupāda,Huh? I can lead.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:That's a good idea.,Prabhupāda,I can lead.
Hayagrīva,"I think what we'll do is you lead the first chant, and then...",Prabhupāda,Others will respond.
Hayagrīva,"And then Mr. Ginsberg can talk a little of his experiences, and then you talk. And then Mr. Ginsberg lead the second.",Prabhupāda,That's all right.
Devotee:,"Devotee:Because Prabhupāda will be speaking for an hour, maybeHayagrīvayou can lead the first chant. You have a very nice voice too. Because he'll be speaking for an hour.",Prabhupāda,If there is time he will also speak.
Hayagrīva,"Oh yes. You'll lead, then we'll respond.",Prabhupāda,"If every one of our devotee will respond, naturally the audience also will respond."
Hayagrīva,We'll have a microphone to make it easier for the audience.,Prabhupāda,Then you also one of us.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Yes. So there is nice microphone?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes. Let's check the pitch of the harmoniums tomorrow. I've been learning to write music. Mykaviguruwas a poet named William Blake. Do you know Blake?,Prabhupāda,"Oh. Yes, yes, I have heard his name."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:So I've been writing music. He's a lot like Kabir. Yes. Śrīmata Kṛṣṇaji and Bankibehari inVṛndāvana. Do you know them at all?,Prabhupāda,Śrīmataji?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Śrīmata Kṛṣṇaji inVṛndāvana, is a lady inVṛndāvanawho translates Kabir into English, compared him with Blake.",Prabhupāda,"No, she is different. I know one Mātājī. She came to see me fromVṛndāvanain Los Angeles. She's in London."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:So I have been learning to notate music, in..., singing songs by William Blake which I've written a little music to. So those are, in a way, my guru's songs.",Prabhupāda,I can give you so many songs. (laughter) Just like he can read it.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Are there many songs in there?,Prabhupāda,Not there. There is diacritic mark. Can you read it?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:No. I don't think.,Prabhupāda,"This,Nitāi-pada..."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Nitāi-pada-kamalakoṭicandrasuśītala.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you are reading."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yechāyāyajagatajurāya.Henanitāivinebhāi,rādhā-kṛṣṇapāitenāi...",Prabhupāda,Dharonitāi...Dṛḍhakori...You can read it. It is not difficult.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Sesambandhanāhijār, bṛthājanmagelo tār.What meter is that in?Da-da-da-dada-da-da,da-da-da-da...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Ahaṅkāremattahoiyā...,Prabhupāda,
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Who wrote this?,Prabhupāda,"This is NarottamadāsaṬhākura, a great poet and devotee."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Who?,Prabhupāda,NarottamadāsaṬhākura.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:You've been writing many in... A beautiful notebook.,Prabhupāda,"This, I was supplied this dummy book, without printing. So I'm using it as notebook. (laughs)"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Would you like to hear one of the Blake songs?,Prabhupāda,Blake song?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, why not."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:(to Peter) Do you want to sing ""Tears Up""? (singing:)",Prabhupāda,He believes in spiritual body. That's nice. (laughter)
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:It's a,...",Prabhupāda,That isKṛṣṇaConsciousness.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:...it's Blake's version.,Prabhupāda,(toHayagrīva) I think you wrote one article about this?
Hayagrīva,"Enlight... I think in one of theKṛṣṇaConsciousness poetry, I mentioned Blake.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yes, he apparently fits into, in the West what is called the Gnostic tradition, which has similar ideas and similarbhaktiattitudes to the Buddhist andHindutraditions. Similar cosmography, cosmology. He was my teacher.",Prabhupāda,He did not give much stress on this material body.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:No! At the end of his life, he didn't count on the material body.",Prabhupāda,"So, there is a spiritual concept of life in his poetry."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:He died singing.,Prabhupāda,Ahh.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:What of Blake's would in fit in, I wonder? ""The Lamb?"" ""The Lamb"" would fit. Oh, ""The Chimneysweeper,"" yes, ""The Chimneysweeper."" (to Peter) Do you want to try that?",Prabhupāda,Chimney sweeper?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:It's a song by Blake: ""When my..."" (to Peter) Do you need the words or, you can follow it without the words, yeah:",Prabhupāda,Some of them.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Oh, it's a Gnostic doctrine, if it's notVaiṣṇava.",Prabhupāda,"Come on. You come, Mr. Ginsberg, take. First of all, you take. You take."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Thank you.,Prabhupāda,Take more.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:It becomes more and more widespread and is more and more acceptable to people...,Prabhupāda,"A Bengali woman is here, thatLekha? She can come and you can give."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I don't know how... It's difficult for me to conceive everybody in America...,Prabhupāda,Nothing is accepted by everybody.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:InSanFrancisco, was it? Yes. ...have all been thinking what form of religious practice, what form of simple meditation exercises could be set forth in America that could be adopted by a great, great, great, great many people on a large scale. We haven't solved the problem. One thing I've noticed is that theKṛṣṇatemples have spread and are firmly rooted and solidly based. There are a number of them now. So that really is a very solid root. So I think that will continue.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:But I'm wondering what future is there? What's the future of a religious observance so technical as this? So complicated as this? Requires so much sophistication in terms of diet, daily ritual,ārati,ekādaśī,all, the whole thing that you've been teaching, how far can that spread by it's very complexness...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. All are complex. The whole idea is to keep the devotees always engaged inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is the program. Gradually, we shall introduce more and more so that he has no scope to go outsideKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Well then the question is...,Prabhupāda,"First of all you have to understand that we are trying to make peopleKṛṣṇaconscious. So how he can remain twenty-four hoursKṛṣṇaconscious, that is the program."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, the orthodox Jews have a very heavy, complicated, moment by moment ritual daily existence in that, for that same purpose. It was to keep them conscious of their religious nature. And that has maintained a small group of Jews over the centuries as an integral unit, but has tended to disappear in the later generations now simply because modern life does not allow that muchKṛṣṇaconsciousness or Jewish consciousness or religious consciousness and attention, act by act throughout the day. So my question is how far can totalKṛṣṇadevotion, act by act all day, spread? How many people can that encompass in a place like America? Or are you intending only to get a few devotees, like several hundred or a thousand who will be solid and permanent.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. That is my program. BecauseKṛṣṇaconsciousness is not possible for everyone. Because in theBhagavad-gītāwe learn,bahūnāṁjanmanāmante[Bg.7.19].After many, many births one can come to this. So it is not possible that a mass of people, a large quantity of people will be able to grasp it. You see?Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁprapadyate[Bg.7.19].Another place it is said in theBhagavad-gītā,manuṣyāṇāṁsahasreṣu[Bg.7.3].After many thousands of men, one may be interested how to liberate himself. And out of many such liberated persons, one may understand what isKṛṣṇa. So understanding ofKṛṣṇais not very easy thing. But LordCaitanyais so munificent that He has given us a, I mean to say, easy process. (indistinct) OtherwiseKṛṣṇaconsciousness is not easy. BecauseKṛṣṇais the last word of Absolute Truth. Generally, people are just like animals. Out of many such persons, one becomes interested in the scriptures. And out of many such persons, if they're attracted to the scriptures, they're attracted to the ritualistic ceremony for improving their economic condition. You see? Just like Christians, they go to... Not Christian, everyone. They take up religion with a motive that they may improve their economic position.Dharma,artha.Arthameans money. And then whyartha?Why you want money? Now, to satisfy senses.Kāma.Dharma,artha,kāma.And when one becomes frustrated in sense gratification, then liberation, to merge. These four things are going on.Dharma,artha,kāma.TheBhāgavatasays thatdharmais not meant for acquiring money. Money is not meant for satisfying senses. Sense gratification should be accepted simply to maintain this body. That's all. The real business istattva-jijñāsā,to understand. The human life is meant for understanding the Absolute Truth.Jīvasyatattva-jijñāsānaś cehayatkarmabhiḥ.Kāmasyanendriya-pritir labhojīvetayāvatā[SB1.2.10].Kāmasya,sense gratification, does not mean you have to increase the volume of sense gratification. No.Jīvetayāvatā,you have to accept sense gratification so far as you can live very nicely. The real business isjīvasyatattva-jijñāsā.Every human being should be inquisitive to know the Absolute Truth. That is the real business of human life. So to come to that business, you won't find mass of people. It is not possible. You don't expect."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Your plan here in America, then, is to set up centers so that those who are that concerned can pursue their studies and practice a ritual?",Prabhupāda,"My... Personally, I have no, I mean to say, ideal or ambition."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"But it is the mission of human life to come to that point. So at least there must be some center or institution who may give them this idea. It is not that everyone will come. Just like there are many educational department. I know in Calcutta in our boyhood age, at that time Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee was vice-president. So he opened some classes in the university. In each class there were four or five professors, and at that time the professors' salary was 1300 dollar, 1400 dollar. And the fees were collected, at most thirty-six dollar per month. You see? But still the classes were to be maintained because the ideal must be there. So our mission is the intelligent persons of the world may know that this is not, simply seeking after sense gratification is not the aim of human life. Human life is meant by... Just likeBhāgavatasays,jīvasyatattva-jijnasa.Vedāntasays,athātobrahmajijñāsā.The same thing.Bhāgavatais nothing but explanation ofVedānta. SoVedāntasays that this human form of life is meant for inquiring aboutBrahman.Athaataḥ.Now.Athameans now.Atha,hereafter. That means after passing through all animalistic way of life, when a man comes to the stage of civilized life, perfect civilized life, at that time his business is to inquire about the Absolute Truth, what is the Absolute Truth. That is the wholeVedāntaphilosophy, ""What is that Absolute Truth?"" The same thing is explained inBhāgavata,jīvasyatattva-jijñāsa.Jīvasyameans all living entities. The main business is to inquire about the Absolute Truth. So people, by education they are misled. Instead of getting them to the highest topmost stage, to the platform of inquiring about the Absolute, they are giving facilities how you can satisfy your senses nicely."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:O.K., but now in America there is a bankruptcy of sense satisfaction. Everybody agrees.",Prabhupāda,Must be there. Must be there.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Everybody agrees that our civilization has come to the end of its possibilities materially. So everybody understands that. It's in New York Times editorials as well as in the editorials of ISKCON journals. Both. And there is a population explosion as you've noted and as the middle class has noted. So everybody then is looking for an alternative to material extension.,Prabhupāda,They should inquire about the Absolute Truth.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Okay. So my original question was: is the complicated ritual and the Sanskrit language...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. Now we are placing so many things in English language. Our all books are being published in English. Our magazine is in English."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:But the question is, is the mode of life that you are proposing adaptable to many, many, many people?",Prabhupāda,"That I say that is not for many, many people."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yeah. But there are, there is a thirstbymany, many people for an alternative answer. For a better alternative system.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So if they are actually thirsty, if they are actually thirsty, then they can adopt this. What is the difficulty there? There is no difficulty. So many American boys they have already adopted. They are not feeling any difficulty. They are feeling relief. What is difficulty? In what point it is difficult?HareKṛṣṇachanting you are chanting."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes.,Prabhupāda,It is all in Sanskrit. What difficulty you are feeling?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:I don't feel too much difficulty, except aesthetically I do feel a difficulty. Yes, there is. The difficulty I feel is that there should be some flower of the American language to communicate in rather than...",Prabhupāda,Therefore we are seeking your help.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yeah. Well I haven't found a way, I still just stay chantingHareKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore why I have come to you? That is also my view. I have come to America with this view, that America is on the summit of material civilization. They are not poverty-stricken. You see? And they are seeking after something. Therefore I have come, that ""You take this, you'll be happy."" That is my mission. And if the Americans take, then all other countries will take because America is leading at the present moment. So persons, exalted persons like you, you try to understand. What is the difficulty? There is no difficulty. ChantingHareKṛṣṇa, anyone can chant. Even the child is trying. There is no difficulty. And so far what is our modes of living?"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Mere chanting without the practice of a philosophy and a daily ritual...,Prabhupāda,"Philosophy is there. We are teachingBhagavad-gītā.We are talking onBhāgavataphilosophy, we are talking on Caitanya's philosophy."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:And you have a daily ritual.,Prabhupāda,We are distributing papers. And... Everything is there.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Okay. So my question then, as it was originally when you first asked me, what do I think...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Is theCaitanya-Kṛṣṇaritual, as you have it here in this house and in the otherāśramas,is that something that a large mass of people can enter into?",Prabhupāda,Yes. Why not?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:In America?,Prabhupāda,Yes. Because we have seen. All my students are Americans. So it has to be... And it is spreading.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yes, but what it requires is an adaptation of Indian dress and an adaptation...",Prabhupāda,That is not very important.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:And an adaptation to Indian food.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. Indian food... It is not Indian food. Are you not eating fruits?"
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,Then that is Indian food? Do you mean to say it is Indian food?
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, the curries.",Prabhupāda,"Curries you may boil only. That doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that you have to take our taste. No. That is not the program, that to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious you have to change your taste. No. We say from theBhagavad-gītā...Kṛṣṇasays,patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyaṁyo mebhaktyāprayacchati[Bg.9.26].""Anyone who is offering Me with devotion these vegetables, fruits, flowers, milk, I accept that."" But we are going to satisfyKṛṣṇa. Therefore we are selecting foodstuff from this group. That you are all already accepting. Don't you take vegetables? Don't you take fruits? Don't you take grains? So where is the new item? Now, so far cooking, you can cook in your own taste. But the group must be this. Not meat. BecauseKṛṣṇadoes not say. That is our program. So you are already taking grains, you are eating fruits, you are drinking milk. So where is the difference? I don't find any difference."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, I suppose not. You could say there is no difference because the food is basically the same materially. It's just a question of the style.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now you take... Style may be different. That's all right. Besides that, to maintain your body and soul together, you require eating, you require sleeping, you require mating, you require defense. We don't say that you don't do this.Kṛṣṇawas...Arjunawas defending. Rather, he wanted to be nonviolent. ""Oh, what is the use of fighting?""Kṛṣṇasaid, ""No. It is required. You should."" So where is the difference? There is no difference. Simply we are adjusting things so that you may become happy. Any intelligent man will take it. We are not prohibiting, but we are adjusting. So there is no difficulty. Simply intelligent persons like you should try to understand and take it and administer because your country is wanting this."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:But there is a limit to how much the pronunciation ofKṛṣṇawill spread I think. There's a limit.,Prabhupāda,Hm? No limit. You can pronounce in any wayKṛṣṇa. K-r-i-s-h-n-a. That's all. Any way.Niyamitaḥsmaraṇenakālaḥ.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:The limit is people's prejudice...,Prabhupāda,"So we don't say that why you are chantingKṛṣṇalike this? We never say that. We simply say, please try to chantKṛṣṇa."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Or let us say there would be a limit until the wordKṛṣṇabecame as common in English as any other English word.,Prabhupāda,It is already in the dictionary. It is already in the dictionary. All dictionaries you will findKṛṣṇa. What do you want more?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:That is true... True. But they don't say Christ. (laughs),Prabhupāda,"Now Krist... I have read one book, Aquarian..."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:Aquarian Gospel?,Prabhupāda,"Gospel, yes. In there it is explained that Krist means love. Christ means love. AndKṛṣṇaalso means love. So there fromKṛṣṇathis word Krist has come. And in India somebody says Kristha. Instead ofKṛṣṇa, they say Kristha."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Where?,Prabhupāda,"And inapa-bhraṁśa,has come Kestha. Generally they talk, instead of pronouncing very nicelyKṛṣṇa... Somebody's name is Kṛṣṇachandra. ""Hey, Kesthara."""
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Where is this?,Prabhupāda,"In India everywhere. Kestha. So Kestha, Kristha orKṛṣṇa, they're on the same group, aiming the same group. It is not difficult."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Of course, Catholicism in the West operated in Latin.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Catholicism in the West operated in Latin for centuries.,Prabhupāda,"Latin is from Sanskrit. Yes. Latin is from Sanskrit. Professor Rowe and Webb of Presidency College in Calcutta, they have got a grammar. They have said the Sanskrit language is mother of all languages. They were big English scholar, professor, Mr. Rowe and Webb. We had to read their grammar in our childhood. They have said that Sanskrit language is the mother of all languages. And in the dictionary you'll find Indo-European language practically all from Sanskrit. The original wordmātṛ-śabda—the ""mater,"" no?"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:But the question I'm posing still is this. You accept the possibility of a series ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness centers in the United States.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Provided a man is not adversely inclined. Otherwise it is very simple.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:But what I'm wondering is how far beyond exclusive centers, how far beyond that can it go in the United States? How far beyond a special study cult centers can aKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement or any religious movement grow? 'Cause the need is for a large single unifying religious movement in America.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So here isKṛṣṇa. All-attractive. You now find out... You can say, ""Why I shall acceptKṛṣṇa?"" You can say like that. Your first question is the unifying agent. I say here isKṛṣṇa. Now we can analyze, ""Why you shall acceptKṛṣṇa?"" Then I shall reply, ""Why you shall not?"" What do you want, expect from the Supreme or the unifying, what do you expect? Everything is there inKṛṣṇa. Opulence-Kṛṣṇa. Beauty-Kṛṣṇa. Wisdom-Kṛṣṇa. Renunciation-Kṛṣṇa. Strength-Kṛṣṇa. Everything inKṛṣṇa. Whatever you want you'll find inKṛṣṇa. That is the unifying center. That I will convince you. He is the unifying center actually. AndBhagavad-gītāit is said,mamavartmānuvartantemanuṣyāḥparthasarvaśaḥ.""Everyone is trying to come to Me. Everyone is trying to come to Me.""Yeyathāmāṁprapadyante[Bg.4.11].""But he's realizing Me in My different phases. But everyone is trying."" So so far unifying religion is concerned there are three groups: impersonalists, personalists, and localized. Some are trying to understand the Absolute Truth in impersonal way. Some are... The yogis, the mental speculators, they are trying to understand the Absolute in impersonal, without any personal form. And the yogis, they are trying to find outKṛṣṇawithin their heart, meditation. And some are trying to find out the Absolute Truth in person by reciprocating love. So all these things are inKṛṣṇa. AndBhāgavatasays after explanation of that verse that it is the only business of human being to find out the Absolute Truth. Now, the next verse, the Absolute Truth is explained, analyzed,vadantitattattva-vidastattvaṁyajjñānamadvayam[SB1.2.11].Now, Absolute Truth is always one. There is no... Absolute Truth cannot be two. Then it is relative truth. Absolute Truth means one. So the knowledge of the Absolute Truth is one.Vadantitattattva-vidas[SB1.2.11].Tattva-vidasmeans those who are in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, they say that Absolute Truth is one. But He's realized in three phases.Brahmeti paramātmetibhagavānitiśabdyate.Brahmanmeans impersonal, andParamātmāis localized, andBhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So these are different stages. Just like the sun. The first experience of sun is this impersonal effulgence all over the sky. But that is not very important than the sun globe. Because it is from the sun globe the effulgence is coming. So anyone will understand that this sunshine is not so important as the sun globe. And if you approach the sun globe and if you penetrate into the sun, if you have got strength to go into the... Just like you are trying go to the moon planet. If you have got really scientific strength to go within the sun planet, then you'll find there is sun-god. That information we get fromBhagavad-gītā.Imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam[Bg.4.1].""I told the sun-godVivasvānfirst."" So therefore there is a person. And why not a person? Your imagination is not ultimate truth. We get information fromKṛṣṇa, there is a person,Vivasvān. So there is a person, he's sitting there. Person, globe, sun, sunshine. Which is important? Which is important?"
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:The person, the globe or the sunshine?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:(laughs) I don't know.,Prabhupāda,"Why you don't know? You cannot say them? Which of them? These three things are presenting. The sunshine, the sun globe, and within the sun globe, the sun-god. Who is important?"
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:If we could apprehend it in terms of person, the person.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:But if we could apprehend it only in terms of the globe, then the globe.",Prabhupāda,"So that means your approach may be up to globe, but that is not finished."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"That is not finished. You have to go... That is...Upaniṣadsays that, he's praying that ""Please wind up Your effulgence so that I can see Your true face."" TheUpaniṣadsays. You see in theUpaniṣad.And he's praying that ""Please wind up Your this glaring effulgence so that I can see Your real face."" So real face is there. AndBhagavad-gītāsays,brahmaṇo 'hampratiṣṭhā.""This impersonalBrahmanis standing on My existence."" AndBrahma-saṁhitāsays that"
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yes, but I'm not even convinced.",Prabhupāda,No.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:I mean, everything you say is beautiful, but...",Prabhupāda,"No. You are very intelligent boy. Why not you are intelligent? You are recognized poet, you are popular poet. Why you... I take you are intelligent. You are first-class intelligent. You are chanting."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:But that's almost a physical body movement, the chanting rather than a...",Prabhupāda,"Maybe, but your intelligence is sufficient. That is... If that standard of intelligent men I get, that is my fortune. You see. Now, at least I request you, you try to understand thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness philosophy. It is not sentiment. It is not bluffing. It is not a money-making business that I give you some..."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:No. Obviously not.,Prabhupāda,You see? You know from the very beginning. I came here single-handed. I chanted. That's all. I never asked anybody money.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:That was never in question.,Prabhupāda,"So I never said that ""I'll give youKṛṣṇaconsciousness or this..."" No, I mean to say... So it is not bluff. It is purely scientific, transcendental science. So I want some American gentlemen to understand this."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, Howard does.",Prabhupāda,Yes. So we want many Howards. (laughs) Your country is so big.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Actually, what I got into, you were saying so everything stands on ""My,"" Kṛṣṇa's personality. And then there was a twist there: ""But I am empty."" Is that what you said before? Do you remember? Just about eight minutes ago you concluded the description of the sun and the...",Prabhupāda,"Sun globe, sun, and the sunshine."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Oh, oh. I guess that's where I... ""Everything is depending on Me, yet I am not in them.""",Prabhupāda,"""Everything is resting on Me. But I am not there."" Just like this isKṛṣṇa. WithoutKṛṣṇait has no existence. But it is notKṛṣṇa. The pantheist will say ""I... Everything isKṛṣṇa, then I worship this."""
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:So who isKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,KṛṣṇaisKṛṣṇa.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:If He's not apprehensible by senses...,Prabhupāda,"No. Why not senses? This isKṛṣṇa. This isKṛṣṇa. But at the same time... This is the philosophy of LordCaitanya.Acintya-bhedābheda,simultaneously one and different. That is very easy... Suppose this is gold. But this gold is not the gold mine. There is a difference. It is gold. Similarly, everything isKṛṣṇa, but still is different fromKṛṣṇa. That is explained inViṣṇuPurāṇa.Parasyabrahmaṇaḥśaktiḥsarvedamakhilaṁjagat.Eka-sthānīsthitasyaj&#241erjyotsnāvistāriṇīyathā,parasyabrahmaṇaḥśaktiḥsarvedamakhilaṁjagat.The same example, that the sun. The sun is, sun-god is situated one place, but it is fiery. Blazing fire. Its heat and light is expanded. You see practically, the heat and light. So whatever this material existence is the sunlight, sunshine. Everything existing on sunshine. It is scientific. Your electricity, your this, that, whatever you take it is all sunshine. All these planets are moving, rotating on the sunshine. Heat. If heat is taken away immediately whole thing spoiled. Therefore everything is resting on the energy of the sunshine, but if you say that ""Then let me find out the sun-god in the sunshine,"" that you will have to go there."
Hayagrīva,"The Christians, I think they say, God is more than His creation.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Certainly. This creation is only a part of manifestation of His energy. Insignificant. That is explained inBhagavad-gītā.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, the chanting is easy. The chanting is easy. That's true.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Let them do that. Don't come to the ritualistic performances. Let them chant as far as possible and see the result. This is the easiest method of transcendental realization. But if you recommend, oh, that will be accepted by many. And if we..."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:No. You see, I recommend it quite a bit but it isn't accepted by very many.",Prabhupāda,"(laughs) No, no. Then I say, you are American. You are popular leader. You have got some voice. I am a foreigner. I have come new, and who cares for me? That is a different thing."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, that's why I'm asking you very specifically cause I've been chanting for five years, six years. Since 1963, '64. Since the fall of 1963, I've been chantingHareKṛṣṇaon this continent, beginning in Vancouver in July, 1963. And I am finding there is a limitation to how many people will join that chant. Or I have found a limitation. Part of the limitation is the fact that it is strange and new to people here.",Prabhupāda,But there is no loss.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:As it becomes familiar, it might spread a little. Part of the limitation is just a natural resentment or resistance, people wanting a prayer in their own tongue, in their own language. I don't know... So that is, for the same reason an American Indian chant would not take hold or even a Latin chant would not take universal hold.",Prabhupāda,"Mantra,mantrameans..."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:So that many of us will say, ""Is it possible to find an Americanmantra?""",Prabhupāda,Mantrameans the transcendental sound. You see. Just likeoṁkāra.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:So you think the very nature of the sound... Okay, but now,oṁis an absolutely natural sound from the throat to the mouth. And yet evenoṁ,natural as it is, sounds foreign.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Therefore it is apraṇāma.It is accepted.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:That also sounds foreign here. It's hard to get people to sayauṁeven. 'Cause I tried in Chicago withauṁand withHareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,But there is no other alternative.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, we haven't been able to think of one yet, I'll tell you that.",Prabhupāda,That is his misfortune if they...
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yes, that's not English. (laughter) But it's known in English. And maybeKṛṣṇacould become as well known as God and Amen, or something like that.",Prabhupāda,"No,Kṛṣṇais in English dictionary."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes. Now in the dictionary?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,Although as an incarnation ofViṣṇu.,Prabhupāda,English dictionary.
Lady:,Lady:(Bengali),Prabhupāda,Just see. Here is an intelligent statement. Yes. You can explain in English.
Lady:,Lady:Yes. But the only difference is that thatKṛṣṇaconsciousness is unlimited. It glorifies the Lord and it makes unlimited. But this education is just limited. See? Limited education other people can come and learn and take their language of their own mother tongue.,Prabhupāda,Takes so much trouble. Simply for uttering oneKṛṣṇathey are not prepared to take little trouble?
Lady:,"Lady:Liberation. The whole life, whole human life liberation. They don't take, they don't like to take because it is started in Indian language. Or it is not Indian language.Kṛṣṇais not Indian language.Oṁisn't Indian language. It's the ultimate God's name.",Prabhupāda,NeitherKṛṣṇasays that He is Indian.
Lady:,"Lady:He didn't say, ""I am Indian."" It's universal. It's not Indian.Oṁis not Indian. Anybody who wants to knowoṁ,how to sayoṁ.See?",Prabhupāda,So you have to accept little trouble to utterKṛṣṇa. That's all.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I'm willing.,Prabhupāda,We have taken so much trouble for understanding English language. And simply for our transcendental understanding...
Lady:,"Lady:Yes,KṛṣṇaisSantaClaus. He is everything. He gives everything.",Prabhupāda,Very good.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Have you seen that? Kṛṣṇa's next to Kris Kringle.,Prabhupāda,"What is the, what is theKṛṣṇa? What does he say?"
Lady:,Lady:Only the Indian people are lucky that still they are holding it tight. That's all. Now other people have forgotten. But it's all universal.,Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇasaid in theBhagavad-gītāthat ""I am the father of everyone.""Sarva-yoniṣukaunteya[Bg.14.4].Not only human being. All animals, trees, plants. SoKṛṣṇais universal."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Now, for instance, in America many of the black people are tending toward Allah and toward Muhammadanism.",Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. Somebody is inclined to some thing, somebody is inclined to some thing. That is going on, and it will go on till the end of the creation. (laughing)"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yuga.,Prabhupāda,"But our process is that, you are searching after the center, here is the center. That is our proposal."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:But what do you do when different religious groups claim to be the center? What do you do when different religious groups...,Prabhupāda,"No, we welcome every religion. We don't decry any religion. Our point is the love of Godhead. OrKṛṣṇais love, all-attractive. So we want to be attracted byKṛṣṇa. Just like a magnetic force and iron. Unless iron is rusty, it is automatically attracted by the magnetic force. Similarly, we are contaminated by material coverings. So we are trying to make it rustless so that immediately we shall be attracted. This is the program.Kṛṣṇais all-attractive. That is a fact. And we are attracted. But being covered with this rust, we are, instead of being attracted byKṛṣṇa, we are being attracted bymāyā.This is our whole program. So our central program is how to loveKṛṣṇa, or how to love God. So we want to see... That is theBhāgavatadefinition, that how much you have enhanced your love of God. You callKṛṣṇaor something else, that doesn't matter.Phalenaparicīyate.The result. Your religious principle, what is the result? Are you enhancing your love for God or dog? That we want to see. If you are enhancing your love for God, it is all right. We don't say anything. But if... People should learn how to love. That is the perfection of life. That we are teaching."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:If you're identifying love, however, with thesabdaKṛṣṇa, what of those people who identify love with thesabdaAllah?",Prabhupāda,"If thatśabda,of course, identifies with God, we have no objection. ThatCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid thatnāmnāmakāribahudhānija-sarva-śaktis.God has many names. God is attractive, His name is also attractive, because He's not different from His name. If you have got exactly the same attractive name, we have no objection. We simply say, ""You chant God's name, holy name."" Then you become purified. That is our program. We don't say that you change your Christianity. No. We don't say. If you have got a nice name, all-attractive name, in your scripture-don't manufacture but authorized—then you chant that. We simply request, ""You chant."""
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, then how would you adapt theKṛṣṇachanting to Christianity? By seeingKṛṣṇaas Christ or Christ asKṛṣṇaand sounding Christ's image in Kṛṣṇa's name?",Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇa, Christ... Of course, this question was several times put to me. Christ says that ""I am son of God."" AndKṛṣṇasays ""I am God."" So there is no difference. Son of God and God, we respect everyone. If I respect your father, I respect you also. Do you mean to say if I disrespect your father, you'll be pleased upon me? No. That is our philosophy. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusays that I am servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant ofKṛṣṇa[Cc.Madhya13.80]. So if anyone lovesKṛṣṇa, he must love Lord Jesus Christ also. And if one perfectly loves Jesus Christ he must loveKṛṣṇa. If he says, ""Why shall I loveKṛṣṇa? I shall love Jesus Christ,"" then he has no knowledge. And if one says, ""Why shall I love Jesus Christ? I shall love..."", then he has also no knowledge. If one understandsKṛṣṇa, then he will understand Jesus Christ. If one understands Jesus Christ, you'll understandKṛṣṇa."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, then do you think that theHareKṛṣṇachant could serve as an intermediary to link the religious tendencies of, both of Christianity and Muslim religions?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. Any religion. Any religion. If he's serious about religion. If he takes the religion as a scapegoat, that is different thing. If he wants to understand religion and if he takes seriously to religion, then he will understand. We want serious persons. Now, according toŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,religion means creation of the laws of God.Dharmaṁtusakṣādbhagavat-praṇītam[SB6.3.19].Laws of God. Who will deny it? Who will deny it? Any religion, Christian, Muhammadan or any. Who can deny that religion is the laws of God? Simple explanation. If you ask what is meant by religion, religion is laws of God. That's all. And if you want to know what is God, that is also replied. ""The original source of everything."" So one should try to understand in this way. But if one wants to remain in his compact ideas and does not want to go further, then it is very difficult. He should be open-minded and appreciating. Then everything is all right. We say,CaitanyaMahāprabhusays, it is not that you are necessarily to chantKṛṣṇa, but if you have no suitable name, then chantKṛṣṇa. Why do you make differentiate. Every name is the same."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:So if you have no other suitable name, chantKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,Yes. ChantKṛṣṇa.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:That's Caitanya's...?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Did He feel there were other suitable names? Did He feel or did He think that...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He said many thousand millions names there are. But if you are serious about God, then... You may have many names by your friends, but any name will do."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Okay. So the problem I was posing before is, which I leave open, I don't know. What is the most attractive and suitable name here in this material country?",Prabhupāda,"Now, take for example the Muhammadan name Allah. Allah means the greatest. So God is greatest. So that greatest conception is thisBrahmanconception. And so far Christian, I don't think they have got any particular name. They say God."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yes. Lord, God. That is the basic one.",Prabhupāda,Controller. God means controller. Is it not?
Hayagrīva,I don't know.,Prabhupāda,God is the equivalent ofīśvara. Īśvarameans controller.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Then the Jews, which were my background, had a prohibition...",Prabhupāda,Jehovah.
Lady:,Lady:Impersonalists. They believe in just the Absolute. That's all.,Prabhupāda,That was the difference in Jesus Christ. He was a personalist.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Yes. They put their devotion into the rabbi or theguru. The ancient Hebrew... I guess you must know about that. The ancient Hebrew teaching was that the name of God should never be pronounced.,Prabhupāda,Now we come to know...
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:J-H-V-H.,Prabhupāda,Anyway why God's name...
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Pictures should not be made. Pictures should not be made. Because it would limit God to human conception.,Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. That is in Muhammadan. That means God is not material. That is the idea. Because here the idea is when I make something image or picture, that is material. So there is a prohibition of accepting God as material. But if you go to a higher stage, then you'll understand that if God is everything then there is no material. That isVaiṣṇavaphilosophy. If God is everything, then where is material? He is spiritual. Material means when you cannot understand God. That is material. Everything is sky. When it is covered by cloud we call it is cloudy. Similarly, cloud has no existence. It comes only to cover sometimes, but the sky is eternal. Similarly, God is eternal. When you are covered by somemāyā,you cannot see, you cannot understand God, that is material. So any philosophy which does not help understanding God, that is material. That is material. Otherwise, there is no material. Where is material if God is everything?Sarvamkhalvidambrahma.You see?"
Hayagrīva,All spirits.,Prabhupāda,"All spirit. All the sky. Everywhere is sky, but when it's covered it is called cloud. Similarly when God is covered by some nonsense ideas, then it is material. Otherwise, there is no material. Therefore those who are too much absorbed in materialistic way, there is a restriction but don't attempt. Because he will be to think that God's name is just like my son's name my daughter's name. Therefore that restriction."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Yes, we have to work on the music boxes. We have to start material preparations for the evening.",Prabhupāda,"That is not material. (laughter) We have no,..."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Aśabdapreparation.,Prabhupāda,"Yes,śabdais originally spi...,śabda-brahman."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:We have to find out if all the...,Prabhupāda,"Simply you have to understand that there is nothing material, everything is spiritual. That is required. So long you do not understand that everything is spiritual only, that is our defect."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Well, then even sexuality is spiritual?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is said in theBhagavad-gītā:if you use sexuality for giving birth to nice child, not cats and dogs, that is spiritual. But people are using sexuality for other purposes. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,śāstra-viruddho(?), according to religious ritualistic way, if one, when one uses sex life that is (indistinct). That is, therefore in the, according to Vedic system, therefore, having sex life with wife, there is a great ceremony which is calledgarbhādhānaceremony, and all the highercaste,brāhmaṇa, kṣatriyas,śūdra,ervaiśyasespecially, they are to observe ten kinds of reformative process. The first process is while giving birth to a child there is a great ceremony,garbhādhāna.So it is not a secret. To beget nice child, then there will be nice population, then there will be peace and prosperity. If you beget cats and dogs, how can you expect peace and prosperity? Living in the same dog society, cat society then there will be peace? No."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I would rather dogs and cats being Kṛṣṇa's though.,Prabhupāda,Hum?
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:But if all matter isKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,"That's all right, but whenKṛṣṇais covered, whenKṛṣṇais covered,nāhaṁprakāśaḥsarvasyayoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ[Bg.7.25].The same example: cloud is sunshine, but it covers. What is the cloud? This is creation of the sunshine as these trees and everything is creation of sunshine. Cloud is also. Mind is also Kṛṣṇa's. In that sense Mind is alsoKṛṣṇa, but it has a covering spirit."
Hayagrīva,It's a whole spirit but in certain circumstances we tend to forget this...,Prabhupāda,"Material energy that's said byKṛṣṇaaparā,inferior energy.Bhūmir āpo, bhūmir āpo analo, prakṛtir mebhinnāaṣṭadhā. Apareyam itastuviddhimeprakṛtiṁparā[Bg.7.5].So material energy is the covering energy, is alsoKṛṣṇa. Just like police department is also government, but it is not very convenient because putting under police department. (laughter) That is also government department. For government the university department and the police are equally important. They are spending equally, are taking care of both the, but for us, ""Oh, police department horrible."" This man is under police department, police custody, and that man is in education."
Lady:,Lady:That's much better.,Prabhupāda,"But when you go to the government state, they are equally important. They are distributing the finance everywhere. So similarly either you take material energy or spiritual energy or marginal energy, all energy of God's, Kṛṣṇa's, but they are acting differently. So, so far I am marginal energy, if I am under the control of the material energy, that is my misfortune. But if I am controlled by the spiritual energy, that is my fortune. Therefore in theBhagavad-gītāit is said,mahātmānastumāṁpārthadaivīṁprakṛtimāśritāḥ[Bg.9.13].They take shelter of the spiritual energy. They aremahātmā,and what is their symptom:bhajantyananyamanaso,simply engaged in devotional service. That, that is required."
Devotees:,Devotees:Haribol!,Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇa. (end) What is called? Lunatic, compact in thought. (chuckles) SoKṛṣṇalover is also another kind of lunatic effect."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Except that it would mean concentrating all my consciousness on the one single image ofKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,Not image.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Or the one single thought or name or feeling or awareness.,Prabhupāda,"That we have got varieties of duties. Just like we are. You have seen all these boys. They are always engaged. Always engaged. Similarly, everywhere they are always engaged inKṛṣṇa. We want extra time to work forKṛṣṇa. The twenty-four hours is not sufficient for us. Yes. Then we shall see that we are sleeping, wasting time. Gosvāmīs, they used to sleep for one half-hour only. That also sometimes forgot."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:To dream?,Prabhupāda,"No. They were always engaged. Volumes of books they have written. When there is no writing, chanting, dancing, talking, and like that—engaged inKṛṣṇaalways. That we have been taught by ourGuruMahārāja, twenty-four hours engagement withKṛṣṇa. Somāyāhas no scope to enter in our mind. She always remains aloof: ""Oh, here is fire. I cannot touch.""Bhaktimukulitāñ... Bhaktistvayisthiratarāyadibhagavansyāddaivenaphalatidivya-kiśora-mūrtiḥ, muktir mukulitāñjaliḥsevate'smān.BilvamaṅgalaṬhākura, a great devotee, he executed devotional service for seven hundred years. He lived for seven hundred years inVṛndāvana. That picture you have seen, Sūradāsa? Yes."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Sūradāsa, the poet.",Prabhupāda,Yes. He is known as Sūradāsa.
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:Teacher ofTulasīDāsa, or student ofTulasīDāsa.",Prabhupāda,"He may be different, butBilvamaṅgalaṬhākura, he was also blind. He made himself blind. You know the story ofBilvamaṅgala?"
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:No.,Prabhupāda,"BilvamaṅgalaṬhākura, in his previous life, he elevated himself to the loving stage ofKṛṣṇa. Not exactly, just previous,bhāva.It is calledbhāva,ecstasy. But some way or other, he could not finish, so according to the instruction of Bhagavad-gītā, he was given birth to a nicebrāhmaṇafamily. (aside:) You can call that Bengali lady. She can hear. So very rich.Śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgehe[Bg.6.41],in that way. Rich family, at the same time,brāhmaṇafamily. But richness, generally, sometimes glide down to wine, women, and intoxication. So by bad company he became woman-hunter, prostitute-hunter. So he was too much addicted to one woman,Cintāmaṇi. So his father died, and he was... He did not marry. In your country it is called girlfriend, and in our country it is called prostitute. So he was that about that prostitute,Cintāmaṇi. So he was performing the rituals, but he was thinking of his girlfriend, thatCintāmaṇi, ""When I shall go there?""BilvamaṅgalaṬhākura? Yes. So he asked his servants, ""Give me some food. I shall go toCintāmaṇi."" So anyway, he performed... Did not perform. His mind was there. He took some nice foodstuff, and when he went, there was a big river, and it was raining heavily, and the river was flooded. So he thought, ""How shall I go the other side?"" So one dead body was floating. So he thought, ""It is a log,"" and he took the help of the log and went the other side. And it was heavy raining. And then, when he reached that Cintāmaṇi's home, he saw the door is locked already. Blocked. So he jumped over the wall, taking the tail of a serpent, and when he reached inside, he knocked the door, andCintāmaṇiwas astonished. ""How did you come? So heavy rain. You had to cross the river."" He said everything, that ""Oh, I cannot stay without you."" So she was much inquisitive: ""How did you come? How did you jump over this wall?"" And so he showed everything, that there was a big snake, and so he thought it as rope and jumped it. And then, when he went to the riverside, he saw that was a dead body. So at that timeCintāmaṇithought, ""Oh, this man is so much addicted to me."" So she told, ""Oh, this much attraction if you would have withKṛṣṇa, oh, how nice your life would have been."" So immediately he came to his senses because he was lifted to that position in his previous life. So immediately he left and was going alone toVṛndāvana. And on the way he saw another beautiful woman. So his business was to be attracted by woman. So he again became attracted. So he was following. So this woman, after entering, she told her husband, ""Just see, this man is following from a distant place."" So he asked him, ""Oh, come on."" He saw he is nice gentleman. He was a rich man,brāhmaṇa.""What is this?"" He said plainly, ""Oh, I have been attracted by your wife, by the beauty of your wife."" ""All right, come on. What is that?"" You enjoy my wife. You arebrāhmaṇa.You are..."" So he was received well. And at night, when he was given place, then he asked that woman, ""Mother, will you give me your hair pin?"" He took the hair pin and pushed in the eyes: ""Oh, these eyes are my enemy."" Since then he became blind. And in that blindness he was worshipingKṛṣṇa, andKṛṣṇawas coming to him. And he would not touch. He'll sing, dance, and He'll supply milk and go away. So thisBilvamaṅgalaṬhākura wrote one book,Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta.It is very valuable book. That is very highly estimated, LordCaitanya."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:What century is that?,Prabhupāda,It is since seven hundred years...
Guest (1) (Indian Woman):,Guest (1) (Indian Woman):Fourteenth...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, fourteenth century."

Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:I'm slowly developing all qualities except sanity. (laughter),Prabhupāda,"Insanity for seekingKṛṣṇa, that is required. Yes. Unless you become insane afterKṛṣṇajust like LordCaitanyabecame... Yes. His worship is to become insane afterKṛṣṇa."
Allen Ginsberg:,"Allen Ginsberg:So what tradition is he in, actually?",Prabhupāda,"He is impersonalist on the whole. He is impersonalist, whole, and he has got someVaiṣṇavathought. That's all, perverted thoughts. Perverted thoughts."

Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Did they meet?,Prabhupāda,"No. She appreciated that LordCaitanyaisKṛṣṇa, and she has written one poetry, song, that ""Now You have left aside Your flute, and You have taken thesannyāsīrod."" In that way she has written nice poetry. ""And where is Your hair and peacock feather? Now You are bald-headed."" In this way. So Mīrā appreciated. Her life is also very excellent. Her father gave her a smallKṛṣṇadoll to play, and she developed love forKṛṣṇaas husband. So when she was married... She was princess, daughter of king, and she was married with another prince."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:What position does AnandamayiMahave now?,Prabhupāda,She is also impersonalist.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:She is impersonalist,Prabhupāda,"She is not a devotee. There are many impersonalists. They take advantage of... They say, ""Caitanya'spatha,Śaṅkara'smaṭha,""that ""Follow the principle ofCaitanyabut ultimately take the conclusion of Śaṅkara."" That means..."
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Śiva.,Prabhupāda,No. Śaṅkarācārya.
Allen Ginsberg:,Allen Ginsberg:Aha. What was the conclusion of Śaṅkarācārya?,Prabhupāda,"Śaṅkarācārya's conclusion was to defeat Buddhism. They do not know it, but actually, when there was too much animal-killing and people became almost atheist under the shadow of Vedic rituals, LordBuddhaappeared. He wanted to stop men from the sinful activities of killing unnecessarily under the plea ofVedas.So he invented thatahiṁsa,nonviolence. And... Because people will give evidence, ""Oh, in theVedasthere is..."" They are not following, actually, the Vedic rituals, but just like crooked lawyers take advantage of law books, similarly... Therefore, LordBuddhasaid that ""I do not follow Vedic rituals. I have nothing to do withVedas.It is my own formula.""

""So you are so... I have to talk with you. You are very learned."" Ordinary formalities. Then he went away. And he was also great worshiper of mother <a href=""/d/sarasvati"" class=""d"">Sarasvat&#299;</a>. Then he began to pray to <a href=""/d/sarasvati"" class=""d"">Sarasvat&#299;</a>, ""Mother <a href=""/d/sarasvati"" class=""d"">Sarasvat&#299;</a>, by your grace I have become victorious in so many places. And what is this, that I am defeated by a boy who is a grammar student?"" So he began to pray, and mother <a href=""/d/sarasvati"" class=""d"">Sarasvat&#299;</a> informed her (him) that ""He is God, my husband. So you speak means I speak. So how can I defeat my husband? That is not..."" (knock at door) Come on. Come on. (someone enters) Yes, come. Yes. You can put there. (someone offers obeisances) Put there. All right. Put there. That's all. Very good. So then he further did not attempt to talk with Him. He went away, and the mother <a href=""/d/sarasvati"" class=""d"">Sarasvat&#299;</a> advised him that ""You surrender unto Him.
