Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:Swamiji? Didn'tKarṇarequestArjunanot to fight when he was lifting the chariot? Didn'tKarṇarequestArjunanot to kill him?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Request. ButKṛṣṇasaid, ""No. You kill him. I say.""Arjunasaid, ""That's all right. (laughter) When You order me, 'Fight,' I don't care for any morality or discipline. Your order is 'Fight.' """
Devotee:,Devotee:Can you chant for us loudly? Can you chant from theBhāgavata?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, I'll chant.HareKṛṣṇa. Oh, thank you very much. All should be offered there,Jagannātha. The etiquette is nice. Everything should be offered to the, through the spiritual master. That is the etiquette. No direct. (Prabhupāda chants the second chapter of First Canto.) One chapter. Just play it. [break] ...have the sound only. (Laughs) The explanation... I shall give you little explanation."
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:Isn't the sound, though, as good as the explanation?",Prabhupāda,Yes. Hearing is always good.
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:Although we don't know what it means, but just the sound.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. Sound will act. Just like ""Kṛṣṇa,HareKṛṣṇa,"" is acting, similarly."
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:What chapter is this, Swamiji?",Prabhupāda,"This is second chapter, First Canto.SūtaGosvāmī, before speaking to the audience, he is offering his respect to the spiritual master. To offer respect to anyone means to remember his qualification. Just like we sing... Just like you offer respect to your spiritual master. What is the meaning?"
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Through.Nārāyaṇaṁnamaskṛtyanaraṁcaiva narottamam[SB1.2.4].Yes.
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:Oh, that's his master.",Prabhupāda,"Thank you very much.Naraṁcaiva narottamamdevīṁsarasvatīṁ.Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning. AndVyāsam,and then Vyāsadeva, who is the master of Vedic literature. One after another. This is...Vyāsaṁtatojayaṁudīrayet.Then he is... He was questioned by the audience that what is the most important religion in this age? That was their question. There are many types of religious principles. So what is the best one for this age? So he is replying that question.Munayaḥsādhupṛṣṭo 'haṁ bhavadbhirloka-maṇgalam[SB1.2.5].""You have put very nice question, because you have put the question that 'What is the best religion for the people of this age?' ""Yat-kṛtaḥkṛṣṇa-sampraśno yenātmāsuprasīdati.""And you have, you are very much anxious to understand the activities of LordKṛṣṇa. It is very nice. By this discussion everyone will become actually peaceful and satisfied."" So the answer, ""What is the best religious principle?"" He is answering.Savaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo yato bhaktiradhokṣaje[SB1.2.6].""My dearbrāhmaṇas...""in that meeting all the audience were great learned sages andbrāhmaṇas.So he is addressing them. That is the best form of religion which performing one becomes elevated to devotional service of the Lord. Not religious formalities. One has to test by the result.Phalenaparicīyate.You are Christian, I amHindu, or he is Mohammedan. That's all right. You are very good, I am very good, he is very good. But what is the result of your following religion? Have you attained love of God? Simply I go the church, I go to temple, and I do all kinds of nonsense, I have no love for God, I have love for mymāyāand I go simply..., that is useless. Religious principle means... It doesn't matter whether you areHinduor Christian or Muslim or anything. It doesn't matter. Just seeBhāgavata.Savaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo[SB1.2.6].That sort of religion is nice, best, by which you can develop love of Godhead. It doesn't mention that ""This religion is best, that religion is best."" That religion is best which helps someone, the religionist, to develop love of God, Godhead. If you put to test all kinds of religion in this formula ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,you'll understand which religion is best. You haven't got to ask anybody. Simply by testing how much one has developed love of Godhead. How much one has learned to loveKṛṣṇaor God. If, following any type of religion, if you get this result, then you have performed your religious principle very nicely. This is the answer. And what kind of love?Ahaitukī,without any cause. ""Oh, I love God because I want something from Him."" Generally, as they love God, distress, they want something. ""My dear Lord, I am very unhappy. Please help me."" That is also good. That is not bad. That is accepted inBhagavad-gītā.But that is not pure love. Pure love means there is no reason. ""Why I am lovingKṛṣṇa? Oh, there is no reason. I loveKṛṣṇa. I wantKṛṣṇa."" This is love. Just likeCaitanyaMahāprabhusays... You have got this translation in my first book, that, thatAdvaitahas quoted thatślokain his sermon.(?) ""Whatever you do, You are my Lord. I don't mind whether You put me into distress or You put me into happiness. Or if You don't help me in realizing You. It doesn't matter. Still, I love You. Whether I am going to hell or heaven, it doesn't matter. But I love You."" Just like Cowper said, ""England, with all thy fault, I love you."" This is love. This is material, crude.Ahaitukīapratihatā.Apratihatāmeans that business, ""I loveKṛṣṇa,"" cannot be stopped. ""I could not loveKṛṣṇabecause I was busy in doing this thing or that thing, or because..."" So many reason we can put forward. No. Love ofKṛṣṇacannot be stopped by any material reason. That is love. Nobody can say that ""For this reason I could not loveKṛṣṇa."" There is no reason. There is no impediment for anyone. Any circumstances. So any religious principle which helps a person to loveKṛṣṇaand God, in that way, without any reason, without any impediment... Just like flow of the river. There is no impediment in this world which can stop the flow of the river. Or the waves of the Pacific Ocean. There is no power in the material world which can stop the waves going on, going on, going on. You see? Similarly, that is the best type of religion. Now just see howBhāgavatais liberal in the description of religion. Religion... You are religious, you are very pious man—how it will be tested? How much you have developed love of God. That's all. Without any reason, without any impediment. This is test of best religion.Vāsudeve...(aside:)Gurudāsa, you can hear? Yes."
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:Thank you for chantingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.,Prabhupāda,Śrīmad-bhāgavatamamalaṁpurāṇam.You have gotŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Read very carefully. All these things are already explained there. Cut it into pieces and distribute.
Devotee:,Devotee:Swamiji? Should we read just one chapter a day or...,Prabhupāda,It is very nice if you read one chapterBhāgavatamdaily. It is very nice. You make it a point to read one chapter daily. That is very nice.
Devotee:,Devotee:No more?,Prabhupāda,"No, if you can do more, that's all right. Just like I ask everybody to chant 16 rounds. But if you can chant 1600 rounds, then who prohibits you? You can do that. But we should make a regulation of our life, that ""So many times I chant. One chapter I shall read. I shall go to the temple at this time."" In this way we must have routine work. Then we'll get practiced automatically. Yes. And Gosvāmīs, the Six Gosvāmīs, they were following routine work. Even they...Sāṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.They were doing regularly counting. Just like you are counting sixteen rounds. Not only chanting in that counting, but they were offering obeisances also by counting, that ""Hundred times I shall offer my obeisances."" You see? This is regular routine. Yes."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Swamiji, can you tell me about what you said, going through the spiritual master, not directly toKṛṣṇa, through the spiritual master.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Can you just tell me something about it?,Prabhupāda,"Spiritual master is the representative of God, orKṛṣṇa. Just like if you work in some office, so there is one head man, representative of the proprietor of the company. You have to work under him. If you satisfy that person who is in charge of that department, that means you are satisfying the proprietor of the company. Is it clear? And he can give you direction how to work nicely because he's experienced. The boss. So spiritual master is external manifestation of God. God is within and without. Within, He is Supersoul. He will give you... If you are sincere, He will give you good counsel, ""You do like this."" You'll get dictation from within. That requires advancement of spiritual life. Then you get from within dictation. So God is helping from within and without. Within, asParamātmā, and without as spiritual master. Both ways. As soon as you are sincere, then God will send you to somebody who is Hisbona fidespiritual representative. And if you take help from him, and help within and without... Just like a person going, or a boy going to a school, he's getting training in the school as well as home, both sides. Then his chance is very good. So we have to take both wise: from inside, from outside. You are doing some things in the service of the Lord. How you'll know that you are doing it properly or improperly? This you will know from the spiritual master. If he says, ""It is all right,"" then it is all right. If he says, ""It is not good,"" then it is not good. Just like the same way. The officer in charge, if he is satisfied (with) your work, that means you have satisfied the government or the supreme company, arranger, with whom you have no direct connection.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādo **.Therefore it is said that if you satisfy your spiritual master, that means you have satisfiedKṛṣṇa. Andyasyaprasādādnagatiḥkuto 'pi.And if you have not satisfied your spiritual master, then you must know that you are, what is called, there is no certainty about your whereabouts, what you are doing.Nagatiḥkuto 'pi.Therefore,dhyāyanstuvaṁstasyayaśastri-sandhyaṁvandeguroḥśrī-caraṇāravindam.So spiritual master is necessary and his direction is necessary. That is the system of disciple succession. In theBhagavad-gītāalso,Arjunais surrendering. He was Kṛṣṇa's friend. Why he surrendered himself, ""I am your disciple."" You see in theBhagavad-gītā.He had no necessity. He was personal friend, talking, sitting, eating together. Still, he acceptedKṛṣṇaas spiritual master. So that is the way. There is a system to understand. It is specifically mentioned,śiṣyaste'ham.""I am your disciple now.""Śiṣyaste'haṁśādhimāṁprapannam[Bg.2.7].""You kindly instruct me."" And then He began teachingBhagavad-gītā.Unless one becomes aśiṣya,or disciple, it is prohibited, not to instruct. Not to inst... That instruction is useless. That is the system. We are instructing in the class because there are few disciples who have taken vow to learn from me. Otherwise, I have no business to teach the public. The public may come. But actual interest is to teach my disciples. But that is secondary. For the public, secondary. But real business is to teach the disciples. Just likeŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamwas meant forParīkṣitMahārāja, Śukadeva Gosvāmī's disciple. But there were many others present. They also heard. Yes?"
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:Well, how can we begin to serve you so that you'll be pleased?",Prabhupāda,(laughs) That I shall tell you later on. (laughter) Do you think I am not pleased?
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:I don't know.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, you must know it. How can you say that I am not pleased? How you know it that I am not pleased?"
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:Well, we cause you so much anxiety and everything.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:We cause you so much anxiety due to our faults.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore I am pleased with you. Why I have given up all my anxieties of the sons and daughters who is born from my body, and why I am taking and transferring... (end)"
Girl:,Girl:I didn't check. I just poured it in.,Prabhupāda,You check after giving it? This is not...
Girl:,Girl:How can I distin...?,Prabhupāda,How is that? Eh?
Girl:,Girl:I didn't know.,Prabhupāda,Yes?
Girl:,Girl:It's my fault because I wasn't conscious of what I was doing.,Prabhupāda,It is your fault but is it grievous fault that you put something instead of something?
Girl:,Girl:What can I do?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Girl:,Girl:What can I do now?,Prabhupāda,How it was done? What is that thing you put?
Girl:,Girl:Salt.,Prabhupāda,Salt?
Girl:,Girl:Yes. It tastes like it.,Prabhupāda,"Tastes like. You know that it is..., that was salt?"
Girl:,"Girl:Well, I didn't know.",Prabhupāda,"So somebody responsible should be in charge. That way instead of salt something may be put. So many people cooking is going on. All right.HareKṛṣṇa. (end) Oh, Mr.Murti, I'm very glad to see you. Come here in front. How do you like this movement?Huh?"
Murti,Mr.(inaudible),Prabhupāda,Thank you. (chuckling) So any particular question?
Rukmiṇī,On the picture today that you gave Jadurani a picture of ŚrīViṣṇu. There is a foot on His chest. We didn't know what that was... there was a little footprint.,Prabhupāda,"There are some special marks on the chest ofViṣṇuby which inVaikuṇṭhaHe is known that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise, inVaikuṇṭha, everyone has got the same feature likeViṣṇu. Just like if President Johnson comes here as a gentleman, you'll not, nobody will recognize him whether he's president or not unless he shows his special mark. Is it not? All government officers, big officers, they have got within the coat one, some mark. So far I know. So similarly, inVaikuṇṭhathe inhabitants, they gotsvarūpa.Their form is exactly likeViṣṇu. There is no difference. When the Viṣṇudūta came to takeAjamilafrom the hands ofYamadūta. They were four-handed withśankha-cakra-gadā-padmaasViṣṇu, the lotus flower, this disc, and the club, and the conchshell. There is no difference in the body. Simply by that special mark, some special hair on the chest and there isBhṛgu, I mean to say, sole, sole, a mark of the feet ofBhṛguMuni. So by some special marks one can recognize He isViṣṇu. Otherwise, from bodily features and from dress and from ornaments, there is no distinction betweenViṣṇuand His devotees inVaikuṇṭha. They're all four-handed.Svarūpasāyujyasālokyasārṣṭi.They have got equal, I mean to say, situation of prosperity, wealthy, equally, almost equally powerful. So practically there is no difference betweenViṣṇuandViṣṇu-bhakta. In Kṛṣṇaloka also. OnlyKṛṣṇais little blackish. Otherwise there is no... In the Kṛṣṇaloka they are two-handed, and Viṣṇuloka they are four-handed. All the Vaikuṇṭhas, the residents, they are four-handed. You want four-hand or two-hand? (laughter) Mr.Murti? What do you want? Four hands?"
Murti,Mr.Two hands more thanKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. In this universe onlyBrahmāhas got four hands. Nobody within this universe. AndViṣṇualso. In thisbrahmāṇḍa,in this universe, there is a planet where the ocean is of milk. Here, just like salted water. There are many oceans. Ocean of oil, ocean of ghee, ocean of milk. The ocean of oil, you have got experience in this planet. Within the earth you are getting some... Your civilization depending, your motor car civilization is depending on that ocean of oil. You are getting oil and lavishly spending it. Stock is supplied by God. Your material advancement will be finished if the stock is not supplied by the Lord. So these foolish men, they do not know. They think that ""Without God we can live."" Who has created the ocean of petroleum within the earth? Is it possible for human being? (laughter)"
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:Someone has said that thedhotī,thedhotīthat thebrahmacārīswear, is the dress that's worn inVaikuṇṭha. Is that correct?",Prabhupāda,"Just seeViṣṇu. He has no coat-pant. Here isViṣṇu. OrKṛṣṇa, He has no dress. He is alsobarebody. Only Rādhārāṇī is covered. In India also, still, the covering of the body is only for woman, but men, this, practically onedhotīis sufficient. Sometimeslaṅgota,the underwear.Laṅgota,underwear. What is that?"
Nanda,Nanda-kiśora:Swami? What doesNanda-kiśoramean?,Prabhupāda,"Nanda-kiśora,kiśorameans a boy."
Nanda,Nanda-kiśora:Boy?,Prabhupāda,The transcendental boy ofNandaMahārāja.
Devotees:,Devotees:Oh!,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Madhusudana,"How is the lotus a weapon? They're all weapons. All the symbols in Viṣṇu's hand, are, all the symbols in Viṣṇu's hand are weapons. How is the lotus a weapon?",Prabhupāda,"Lotus is blessing. And that disc and club is for punishing.Viṣṇuhas to see two ways because He's the Lord. So, as it is said in theBhagavad-gītā,paritrāṇāyasādhūnāṁvināśāyacaduṣkṛtām[Bg.4.8].Just like the state. State is meant for punishing the criminals and giving protection to the law-abiding citizen. Wherefrom this idea is taken? It is taken fromViṣṇu. Everything. Because He is the supreme maintainer. So everything is required for maintaining. So thisgada,the club, and the disc is for punishing the disobedient, the demons, or those who are harassing devotees. To punish them theViṣṇu-cakrais there. Just likeMahārājaAmbarīṣa, he was harassed by DurvāsāMuni, andViṣṇu-cakrapunished him sufficiently.MahārājaDurvāsā...MahārājaAmbarīṣawas a great king, but a great devotee at the same time. Because he waskṣatriyaand householder, DurvāsāMuni, he was envious. DurvāsāMuniwasbrāhmaṇaand a greatyogi. So he could not tolerate that a householder king... King is supposed to be dealing in politics, economics. Therefore, according to social position, he is lesser than thebrāhmaṇabecause they are simply engaged in the matter of transcendental advancement of life. But a devotee is above thebrāhmaṇas.That is the position of devotee. Here, the highest qualitative position is to be situated in the modes of goodness or to acquire the qualities ofbrāhmaṇa,in this material world. Truthfulness, controlling the senses, controlling the mind, simplicity and knowledge, faith in God, there are so many qualifications which makes a person as recognizedbrāhmaṇa.But a devotee, never mind whether he'sbrāhmaṇaor acaṇḍāla,he automatically develop all these qualities.Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavatyaki&#241canā[SB5.18.12].Anyone who has unflinching devotional faith in God, he has all the good qualities. I've several times narrated the story of that hunter. He was animal killer and he used to enjoy by killing the animal half. But when he became a devotee, he was not prepared to kill even an ant. Who taught him? Nobody taught him but he was simply chantingHareKṛṣṇa. That's all. So if you actually making progress in devotional service, you are constantly in touch with the purest.Kṛṣṇais the purest.Bhagavad-gītā,it is said,paraṁbrahmaparaṁdhamapavitraṁparamaṁbhavān[Bg.10.12].""You are theparaṁbrahma,SupremeBrahman.""Brahman, every living entity isBrahmanbut He isparaṁbrahma,the leader of theBrahman. Just like the president is the first citizen of the state. Similarly,Kṛṣṇais also a living entity, but supreme living entity. Just like the first citizen. So similarly, every living entity isBrahman, butparaṁbrahmais one. That isKṛṣṇa. And therefore in theBrahma-saṁhitāit is confirmed,īśvaraḥparamaḥkrsnaḥ[Bs.5.1].Kṛṣṇais... Everyoneīśvara,more or less controller. Lord Śiva, LordBrahmā,Indra,Varuṇa,Vāyu,Candra,Sūrya. There are so many. They're all demigods. Say, almost God. But they are not Supreme God. Supreme God is one. Sometimes people who do not know the purpose ofVedas,they say, ""The Hindus are worshiper of many gods."" That is nonsense. Actually those who are followers ofVedas,they worshipKṛṣṇa, onlyKṛṣṇaorViṣṇu.Tadviṣṇoḥparamaṁpadaṁ. Ṛgmantra.Tadviṣṇoḥparamaṁpadaṁsadāpaśyantisūrayaḥ.And in theBhagavad-gītāit is said,vedaiścasarvairahamevavedyam[Bg.15.15].What is the purpose ofVedas?To understandKṛṣṇa. One who does not understandKṛṣṇa, hisVedāntaphilosophy is nonsense. However you may advertise that ""I am Vedāntist,"" is apakkanonsense. Because he has not attained the perfection of Vedic knowledge. The perfection of Vedic knowledge is to knowKṛṣṇa, and that is also confirmed in theBhagavad-gītā:Bahūnāṁjanmanāmante[Bg.7.19].After many, many births.Jñānavān.Jñānavānmeans Vedāntist. Not... They have made it, that Vedāntist... Vedāntist, Vaiṣṇavas, they are also Vedāntist, but it has become a common sense, a common affair that the impersonalists, they are called Vedāntists. Because, due to Śaṅkarācārya's propaganda, they have made their position as Vedāntists. But common men, they do not know that the Vaiṣṇavas are the best Vedāntists. We shall discussVedāntahere also.Vedānta... InRāmānuja-bhāṣyathere is... Perhaps you know, in your country. There isRāmānuja-bhāṣyaVedānta. Madhvācārya, he has also writtenVedānta-bhāṣya.Not only Śaṅkarācārya. But because the Vaiṣṇavas, they knowbhāṣyambrahma-sūtrāṇām**. TheŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamis the actual explanation ofVedānta. So therefore they take more interest inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatambecause that is the actual explanation ofVedānta. Just like in theVedānta-sūtra,the, what isBrahman, Absolute Truth.Athātobrahmajijñāsā.The inquiry is, ""What isBrahman, Absolute Truth?"" TheVedānta-sūtraanswers... TheVedānta-sūtrais made like that, questions and answers like that. So answer isjanmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].""The Absolute Truth is that from whom everything is emanating."" He is the ultimate fountainhead of everything. Just now we tried to explain that the state functions protecting the good citizens and punishing the criminals. That should be the state business. Wherefrom this idea came? The law and... What is called? The law and order department or what is that?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Law and order.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Wherefrom the idea came to the human society unless it is there in the Absolute? How the idea comes? Therefore that law and order isViṣṇu.Janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].The idea of law and order came fromViṣṇu. How nicely explained.Janmādyasya.In two words,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].Janmameans creation, andādi,ādimeans firstjanma,thensthiti.Sthitimeans staying, maintenance. And then dissolution. So three things.Yataḥ,from where these three things are happening. That means this world is being created from that source, it is being maintained by that source, and when it is annihilated it rests in that energy, the whole energy.Pralayaṁyāntimāmikam, Bhagavad-gītā.When everything is dissolved, the energy is absorbed by the energetic. So that is Absolute Truth. SoŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamexplains that Absolute Truth.Janmādyasyayataanvayād itarataścaartheṣuabhij&#241a&#7717;</a> <a href=""/d/svarat"" class=""d"">svar&#257;&#7789;</a></I> [SB </I><a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1"">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> In the <a href=""/d/vedanta"" class=""d"">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href=""/d/sutra"" class=""d"">s&#363;tra</a> it is simply said that ""The Absolute Truth is that which is the fountainhead of everything."" Now if fountainhead of everything, then what the Absolute Truth's nature shall be like? That is explained in the <span class=""Italic"">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href=""/d/bhagavatam"" class=""d"">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span> The first thing is that <span class=""Italic"">janm&#257;dy <a href=""/d/asya"" class=""d"">asya</a> <a href=""/d/yatah"" class=""d"">yata&#7717;</a></I> [SB </I><a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1"">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> The factor, the Absolute Truth from which everything is emanating, so that emanation includes indirect and direct manifestation. What is that indirect and direct manifestation? The direct manifestation is the spiritual world and the indirect manifestation is this material world. Indirect manifestation means it is simply a shadow of the spiritual world. Just like in the Bible also it is said the man is made after God. So you have got two hands, one head, two leg. So the mental speculation is said that these devotees, they create God according to their own feature. Because I am two-handed, and therefore I create God with two hands, <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. But actually, the fact is not that. Actually, because <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has got two hands and we have got an imitation body of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, therefore we have got two hands. Because this is imitation. That we know everything, everyone. This body will not stay. Therefore it has got <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/janma"" class=""d"">janma</a>. <a href=""/d/janma"" class=""d"">Janma</a></span> means birth or creation at a certain period, and it stays, say, for fifty years or hundred years. Then dissolved, dissolution. Therefore it is imitation. Just like if you create a doll, clay doll, very nice beautiful girl. But it will... It is imitation. It is shadow of the real beautiful girl. It is created at some time and... So reality is there in the spiritual world. Therefore it is called <span class=""Italic"">janm&#257;dy <a href=""/d/asya"" class=""d"">asya</a> <a href=""/d/yatah"" class=""d"">yata&#7717;</a></I> [SB </I><a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1"">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> The idea comes from there, but the impersonalists, due to their intelligence being very meager, they think that the Absolute Truth is without any variety, impersonal or void. They think that varieties are only in the material world, but actually, real varieties are there in the spiritual world. It is only reflection, as it is described in the <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a>, <a href=""/d/urdhva"" class=""d"">&#363;rdhva</a> <a href=""/d/mulam"" class=""d"">m&#363;lam</a> <a href=""/d/adhah"" class=""d"">adhah</a>-<a href=""/d/sakha"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;kha</a>. <a href=""/d/adhah"" class=""d"">Adhah</a>-<a href=""/d/sakham"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;kham</a>. <a href=""/d/asvattham"" class=""d"">A&#347;vattha&#7745;</a> pr&#257;hur <a href=""/d/avyayam"" class=""d"">avyayam</a>. <a href=""/d/asvattha"" class=""d"">A&#347;vattha</a>...</span> This material creation, material manifestation is compared with a banyan tree whose root is upward. And that I have explained several times how the tree can be upwards root. That means it is reflection. Just like you stand on the riverside, the tree will be reflected on the river, on the water, as obverted. That means that is reflection. As soon as we say that this is a tree, the root of which is up, that means it is reflection. The <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mayavadi"" class=""d"">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a></span> philosopher, they do not take account of the mathematical calculation, 380 degree. They are taking account of... 360 degree, the whole circle. They are taking account only 180 degree. And other 180 degree they're making void. But actually, the whole point is 360 degree. That is geomatrical calculation. If you simply know 180 degree, then the other 180 degree is unknown to you.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> But that frustration has no disappointment. (laughter) That is the beauty. Just like Lord <a href=""/d/caitanya"" class=""d"">Caitanya</a> is manifesting that spiritual frustration. ""Oh <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, I could not see You."" He's jumping on the sea in frustration. But that frustration is the highest perfection of love. Yes. Everything is there. But without inebriety. You are very intelligent boy. I thank you. Yes. Yes. There is frustration, but not this frustration. Yes. That frustration, I mean to say, enriches one's eagerness of love for <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Everything is there, but without inebriety. Everything is there. Yes. Now see, <a href=""/d/visnu"" class=""d"">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>? Of course, in <a href=""/d/vaikuntha"" class=""d"">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>-<a href=""/d/jagat"" class=""d"">jagat</a> there is no violence. But <a href=""/d/visnu"" class=""d"">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> is taking the symbol of violence. Otherwise what is the meaning of this disc and club? So when He wants to be violent, He comes here as <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/nrsimha"" class=""d"">N&#7771;si&#7745;ha</a>-<a href=""/d/murti"" class=""d"">m&#363;rti</a>.</span> (laughter) And He sends some of His devotees to play violence. That is Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Because there the devotees are so much in accord with <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href=""/d/visnu"" class=""d"">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> that there is no question of disagreement. But violence is when this disagree-ment, atheist. Therefore sometimes a devotee is deputed in this world to play as atheist, and <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> comes to kill him. To teach these people that ""If you become atheist, then here is disc and club for you."" But it is not possible to be displayed in the <a href=""/d/vaikuntha"" class=""d"">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>. Otherwise, if there is no the propensity of violence... Just like there is sometimes mock fight. A father is fighting in mock with a small child, and he has become defeated. But there is pleasure. So <span class=""Italic"">&#257;nandamayo 'bhy&#257;s&#257;t</span> (<span class=""Ref_Italic""></B><a href=""/d/vedanta"" class=""d"">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href=""/d/sutra"" class=""d"">s&#363;tra</a></span></B> <a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1"">1.1.1</a>2)<span class=""Italic"">.</span> The Lord is joyful. So there is joy in fighting also sometimes. So your question that everything is there, that is a fact. Everything is there. Otherwise if everything is not there, they cannot be manifested here because it is reflection. Just like in... Of course, this discovery is by the <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, <a href=""/d/gaudiya"" class=""d"">Gau&#7693;&#299;ya</a> <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>. Just like the love between <a href=""/d/radha"" class=""d"">R&#257;dh&#257;</a> and <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, it is called <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/parakiya"" class=""d"">parakiya</a>.</span> They are not married husband and wife. But R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; appears to be wife of some other gentleman. But <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, from childhood, They were friends. So Radh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; could not forget <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. She used to come to <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and stand like that. That's all. And He was playing. <a href=""/d/kisora"" class=""d"">Ki&#347;ora</a>-<a href=""/d/kisori"" class=""d"">Ki&#347;or&#299;</a>, They were boy and girl. But there is no inebriety. Just like here the boy and girls mix and there are so many abominable things. Distressful, which is binding their material bondage. So that friendship between boy and girl is there, but without inebriety. <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> had so many <span class=""Italic"">gop&#299;s,</span> girlfriend, but there was no contraceptive pills. (laughter) That is the beauty. Here, the so-called love is lust. And there, that is the highest. The same thing, obverted, perverted reflection. Just like in the original tree the topmost part has come down to the down. Similarly, in the spiritual world the highest, topmost level of love, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/parakiya"" class=""d"">parakiya</a>... <a href=""/d/parakiya"" class=""d"">Parakiya</a></span> means love not by marriage life, by friendship. That is there. But there is no such inebriety. It is pure. So perverted means the topmost thing has come down to the lowest. Here, this <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/parakiya"" class=""d"">parakiya</a>,</span> loving other's wife or other's husband, is most abominable, adultery. Not allowed by society, not allowed by the state. But tendency is there. Even one is married, he wants to love another's wife. Or if the girl married (s)he wants to love another husband. Why? That is there. But without inebriety. That is the beauty. So everything is there, but here, that thing is reflected, pervertedly. Therefore misunderstood. There is so many other corollaries. You see? But you must know everything, that without being in the Absolute Truth there cannot be relative manifestation. This world is relative manifestation. So these things are not to be understood in the beginning, but as the questions came we discussed something. But you must know, as the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/vedanta"" class=""d"">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href=""/d/sutra"" class=""d"">s&#363;tra</a></span> says, <span class=""Italic"">janm&#257;dy <a href=""/d/asya"" class=""d"">asya</a> <a href=""/d/yatah"" class=""d"">yata&#7717;</a></I> [SB </I><a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1"">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> Everything is emanated from that Absolute Truth. That is the fountainhead of everything. We cannot manufacture anything. It is not possible. But this is shadow and that is reality. And in the shadow... Just like photograph. You find that everything in detail of your beautiful face in the photograph, but that is not reality. That's all. So you'll find everything in details, all... Or you can understand actual photograph, actual idea, actual notion of the spiritual world by scrutinizingly studying this material world. The impersonalists, they think that in the material varieties there are so many abominable inebrieties, therefore in the spiritual world all these things should be minus, void. That is their material calculation. They cannot think that in the spiritual world also there is love. Because here, in this world, the so-called love or lust is frustrated and followed by so many calamities that therefore they cannot conceive that in the spiritual world also there is love. Their idea, in one sense, is right, that how these nonsensical things can exist in the spiritual world? Therefore they make it altogether minus. No variety. Impersonal. That is less intelligence. They cannot understand that photograph is the reflection of the actual person. There is everything in detail. A movie. Actually, the same man is laughing, walking, dress, everything, but it is all false. That they cannot understand. Therefore the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas say they are less intelligent. The real understanding should be that if in the real person all these features are not present, how they can be reflected in the photograph? The <a href=""/d/mayavadi"" class=""d"">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> says, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahma"" class=""d"">brahma</a> <a href=""/d/satyam"" class=""d"">satya&#7745;</a> jagan <a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a>.</span> <a href=""/d/brahman"" class=""d"">Brahman</a>, the Absolute Truth, is real truth, and this world is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a>.</span> Then <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a></span> means it is a reflection or shadow. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">Mithy&#257;</a></span> does not mean that it has no existence. The shadow is also existence. Therefore <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> philosophers say that <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a></span> means temporary. Now you have got this body. This is temporary. That's the real understanding. And if I say it is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a>,</span> then if I kill you, then why I am punished? I can say, ""Oh, it is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a>,</span> it is false. So what is their fault?"" No. It is not <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a>.</span> It is temporary. Not <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a>. <a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">Mithy&#257;</a></span> how can it be? Because it is reflection of the reality, therefore it cannot be <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a>.</span> Then the reality becomes <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">mithy&#257;</a>. <a href=""/d/mithya"" class=""d"">Mithy&#257;</a></span> means not fact. The real explanation is that this is shadow. Shadow, but the reality is in the spiritual world, and that is indicated in the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/vedanta"" class=""d"">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href=""/d/sutra"" class=""d"">s&#363;tra</a>, janm&#257;dy <a href=""/d/asya"" class=""d"">asya</a> <a href=""/d/yatah"" class=""d"">yata&#7717;</a></I> [SB </I><a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1"">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> The fountainhead of all emanation.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes, you can... Because... Have you seen how the... You have no experience here in your country. Have you got any experience? But in India we have got experience how in the morning the cowboy takes some food from the mother and with the cows he goes to the field. The cows are let loose on the grazing ground. They are enjoying, and this cowboy is sometimes singing. The flute, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's flute is because He is cowboy. The cowboys still play in that flute. In India you'll find. Because the cows are let... They are doing their own work, and what this boy will do? They are playing. There are many cowherds boys, they are playing. Sometimes playing on flutes, sometimes sporting, sometimes eating. So <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was exactly doing like that. All the cowboy friend went with Him. <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was, of course, a very rich man's son. His father was very rich. So He used to take with Him very nice foodstuff, <span class=""Italic"">lugdoo, kacaur&#299;.</span> And other, His poor friends, they were taking <span class=""Italic"">cap&#257;t&#299;s,</span> dry <span class=""Italic"">cap&#257;t&#299;s.</span> (laughs) So they were enjoying, dividing, ""Your food, my food, his food."" And sometimes there was some trouble in the forest because <a href=""/d/kamsa"" class=""d"">Kamsa</a> was after <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> to kill Him.

Very..."" (laughter) The mother will, ""Oh, yes, our <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is very wonderful!"" (laughter) So <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was their enjoyment. That's all.

Yes. <a href=""/d/brahma"" class=""d"">Brahm&#257;</a> also became astonished, and therefore he came to check ""Whether He is my Lord or not?"" (laughter) Yes.

And after a few seconds he came, he said <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is playing in the same way. And although the, I mean, stolen cowherd boys and cows they, by the, I mean to say, energy of <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> by influence of <a href=""/d/brahma"" class=""d"">Brahm&#257;</a>, they were kept in a secret cave. They were sleeping. But <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is playing. That means He has manifested again with the cowherd boys and cows. Then he was convinced, ""Yes, He is my Lord."" Then <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahma"" class=""d"">Brahma</a>-<a href=""/d/stava"" class=""d"">stava</a></span> is there. <span class=""Italic"">&#256;nanda cinmaya <a href=""/d/rasa"" class=""d"">rasa</a> pratibh&#257;vit&#257;bhis t&#257;bhirya <a href=""/d/eva"" class=""d"">eva</a> <a href=""/d/nija"" class=""d"">nija</a>-<a href=""/d/rupataya"" class=""d"">r&#363;patay&#257;</a> <a href=""/d/kalabhih"" class=""d"">kal&#257;bhi&#7717;</a> </I>[Bs.</I> </span>5.37</I>]<span class=""Italic""></I>.</span> So <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> can expand in many, many thousand times. What <a href=""/d/brahma"" class=""d"">Brahm&#257;</a> will do by stealing His... No, that is not possible. So <a href=""/d/brahma"" class=""d"">Brahm&#257;</a> was also convinced.

In this way, going and coming. But when she is elderly she can remain continually with her ...but in the beginning... Because after all, she is girl, so she cannot tolerate the separation from father and mother. So six months here, six months...

That is a fact. We say, ""The child is growing."" Growing or changing-practically the same thing. Actually, it is changing because the former body is no longer to be found. It has accepted, the soul has accepted, another body. This is going on from babyhood to childhood, from childhood to boyhood, boyhood to youth-hood, then old age. So, just like I am old man. I can remember my childhood body, my babyhood body, my boyhood body, my youth-hood body. So the body is no longer, but I am there. I am thinking that ""I did do like this. I was playing like this with my body."" But that body is gone, but still I am there. Therefore it is naturally surmised that when this body will not be existent, I will be existent. I will accept another body. This is very logical conclusion. As I am changing so many bodies, still I am there. I can understand that I changed my body. I was so little. Now I have grown up. I am old. But I am there. Similarly, it is concluded, when this body will not be there, but I will accept another body. This is very easy to understand, that that ""I"" is... Now, we can perceive that when you are spiritually emancipated, you will see yourself, God also, and everything spiritual. That requires time. That requires practice. And we are teaching our students that practice, this <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, to change the consciousness.

Just like <a href=""/d/arjuna"" class=""d"">Arjuna</a>. <a href=""/d/arjuna"" class=""d"">Arjuna</a> was asking <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> that ""How I can believe that you told this philosophy of <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> to <a href=""/d/vivasvan"" class=""d"">Vivasv&#257;n</a>?""

So in reply to that question, <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> said that ""Both you and I had many, many births before, but you have forgotten; I remember."" That is the difference between the Supreme Lord and ourself. He does not forget. He remembers everything, past, present, future, all, but we forget. That is the difference between God and living entity. We are subjected to forgetfulness. So we forget; again, if it is reminded, we remind. That is our nature. So at the present moment we are forgetful of our eternal relationship with <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. And then, by good association, by constant chanting, hearing, remembering, we again revoke our old consciousness. That is called <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. So forgetfulness is not wonderful. It is natural. We forget.

Our mission is to elevate persons from down state of life to the highest state of life. So everyone is in down state. Lord Jesus Christ also said that ""You do not <a href=""/d/hate"" class=""d"">hate</a> the sinners, but <a href=""/d/hate"" class=""d"">hate</a> sin."" Is not that, Lord Jesus Christ said? So hippies may be sinners. We raise them to the pious life. But we say, ""Don't do this. Don't do this sinful act. Don't take intoxication. Don't do this. Don't do this."" We <a href=""/d/hate"" class=""d"">hate</a> sin, not the sinners. Actually. If we <a href=""/d/hate"" class=""d"">hate</a> sinners, then where is the possibility of preaching?</div>

""Gypsies! I haven't seen any gypsies."" Well, I put my shoes. I went downstairs. I went to the door and I start reading. I says, ""This is spiritual. This is beautiful. This is spiritual."" I forgot right away. So she came to the door, Jadurani. She came to the door and she said, ""Hare <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>,"" and she said, ""Come in."" I came in and she started talking to me and that's... I got started. So when I seen her, I said, ""That's not gypsies. That's not gypsies."" And I explained it to her. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I seen the curtains in the window,"" she said, ""and I thought they were gypsies."" ""Oh, well,"" I explained it to her. ""Oh,"" I says. I let her have it, there was no gypsies there. So she used to see me coming down to got to the temple. So nice, yeah? Do you like that place, Swamiji?</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> These four things, namely birth, death, old age, and disease will accompany you. Therefore in the <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> it is said that <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mad"" class=""d"">mad</a>-<a href=""/d/dhama"" class=""d"">dh&#257;ma</a> <a href=""/d/gatva"" class=""d"">gatv&#257;</a> <a href=""/d/punar"" class=""d"">punar</a> <a href=""/d/janma"" class=""d"">janma</a> <a href=""/d/na"" class=""d"">na</a> <a href=""/d/vidyate"" class=""d"">vidyate</a>.</span> ""If you reach My abode in the spiritual sky, then you'll have no more birth."" So this male-female question is everywhere. The only difference is that in spiritual world there is no need of sex life, or there is no impelling sex life, although there is attraction between man and woman. That is... Just like <a href=""/d/radha"" class=""d"">R&#257;dh&#257;</a> and <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. There is attraction, of <a href=""/d/radha"" class=""d"">R&#257;dh&#257;</a> for <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> for <a href=""/d/radha"" class=""d"">R&#257;dh&#257;</a>, but there is no sex life. So male-female, conception of male-female, as we have got here, there is concomitant factor of sex life, but that should not be exported to the spiritual world, that idea. There is also male-female, but there is no sex life attraction. That's all right. Yes?</div>
