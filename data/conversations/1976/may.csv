Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:""The living entities in this conditional world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.""",Prabhupāda,"So with this instrument he's manipulating this machine, as exactly the pilot, with so many electronics, machine, he's working the flying of the plane. Where is the difficulty to understand? And this is, body is a machine.Bhrāmayansarva-bhū....Bhrāmayan,wandering. The aeroplane is wandering. This machine is wandering. It is also going.Ūrdhvaṁgacchantisattva-sthāḥ.Sometimes up, sometimes down.Huh? Find out this. (devotees look for verse) Same aeroplane, going up and down. Two wings, this hand, like this. Guru-kṛpā: ""Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds."" So same thing: if the pilot is not expert, then goes down to the lowest, finished.Adhogacchantitāmasāḥ.If the pilot is third class, instead of going up, he goes down, and everything is spoiled. So everything on the pilot. The machine is not important. The machine can go up if the pilot knows how to do it. And the machine can go down. Actually, it is happening. This landing point is very dangerous. If the pilot cannot handle very nicely, immediately smashed. The crash takes place while going up and coming down, generally. That is due to mismanagement of the pilot. When in the sky it is regular speed and balance, it is going nicely. There is no crisis. All crises take place while coming down and going up. Leaving the land and coming the land. I have seen sometimes, they clap as soon as they.... (Prabhupāda claps his hands. Devotees laugh) ""The danger is over."" Soūrdhvamandadhaḥ.Madhyetiṣṭhantirājasāḥ.So in this way, you have to place the subject matter, that the living entity, the soul, is the important thing within this body. Because he's struggling. On account of his ignorance, he's struggling.Manaḥṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇiprakṛti-sthānikarṣati[Bg.15.7].This is his position."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:You mentioned earlier that not only we have to find out who is the speaker, but who is the proper person to hear the subject matter.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. If somebody is interested to know what is the important thing, then he can understand this. And if he's animal, simply eating, sleeping, mating, what he will understand? Animal is not interested to know how the world is going on. He gets his food and sex. That's all. That is animal propensity. And as soon as he comes to the human platform, then inquisitive.""Keāmi,keneāmāyajāretāpa-traya.""SanātanaGosvāmī.... He's not interested, ""How I shall develop my economic position?"" He has left already a very high-grade economic position. He's not interested. He's interested ""Keāmi,keneāmāyajāretāpa-traya.Actually what is my position? Why I am suffering in this material atmosphere?"" That is human life."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Arjunaasks also many questions.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes.Kārpaṇya-doṣopahata.Kārpaṇya-doṣa[Bg.2.7].""It was my duty to understand myself, and I am thinking of my these nonsense relatives—my grandfather, my son. What is this? I know that. What I can do by thinking about them? It may be they have come to war. But suppose they would have died naturally—what could I do? So why I am perplexed with these things? I know the defect. I cannot cause their death or birth or existence. It is beyond my jurisdiction. And still, I am anxious: If I kill them, then what would happen? What would happen?"" You kill or not kill, they'll be killed, today or tomorrow.Gatāsūn agatāsūṁścanānuśocantipaṇḍitāḥ[Bg.2.11].A learned man knows that the body will be finished, the bodily action, today or tomorrow. So what is to lament after this body? Lamentation is that the person within the body, whether he's going to hell or heaven.Ūrdhvaṁgacchantiortamogacchanti.That is real concern. Body will be finished, today or tomorrow or after a hundred years. Who can protect it? But one should be interested with the owner of the body, where he is going, what is his next position. And that is clearly stated:adhogacchantitāmasāḥ,ūrdhvaṁgacchantisattva-sthāḥ[Bg.14.18].So you are interested to go up or down or remain in the same status. There are three status: up, down, and the same."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:General mass of people think that life is finished with this body. They're unaware of up or down...,Prabhupāda,"Therefore.... Therefore, they're rascals. And for the rascals, theBhagavad-gītāteaching is there. Learn! They are giving the stress on the body, that ""The body is finished, everything finished."" They do not know beyond the body. But the real knowledge begins, ""No, you are beyond this body."" That is real knowledge. That is the beginning of knowledge. Any other knowledge except this, that is ignorance. That is not knowledge. They are accepting ignorance as knowledge."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"That is the defect. ThereforeKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is so essential. They are accepting ignorance as knowledge. Darwin's theory. It is simply speculation on ignorance, and it has been taken as knowledge. Freud's philosophy is the business of the hogs and dogs, and it has been taken as philosophy. Even the hogs and dogs know how to enjoy sex life. And they are.... On account of sex life, they have written a philosophy. Is that philosophy?Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam.Find out. The Thirteenth Chapter. Hmm? (devotees look for verse)"
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Another line?,Prabhupāda,"Find outamānitvamadambhitvamahiṁsākṣāntiḥ[Bg.13.8],Thirteenth Chapter."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam.,Prabhupāda,"Anyathā.These rascals, they're inajñānam,dealing with sex life, dealing with the body as their philosophy, science. Dealing with the body and dealing with sex life is the animal business, and they are passing on as philosopher, scientist. This is their position, the whole world. So how muchKṛṣṇaconsciousness is important, just imagine."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:The goal of knowledge is not there.,Prabhupāda,"They do not know. And animals.... Therefore they are animals. What the dogs will understand? When there is one lady dog, one dozen dog will come. Smelling the best part of the body. (laughter) This is their philosophy. So Freud is that: best part of the body, he's writing philosophy."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Books and books. (laughs),Prabhupāda,"Just see. This is the position. How low taste: hogs' and pigs' business, and write philosophy. His books are selling like anything. (pause)"
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:You mentioned, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that if someone can understand that they're not this body, then immediately he should be able to understand that there's a Supersoul.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that I have already told you just now. Therefore it is very essential to understand."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:So the approach used byKṛṣṇais essential for any person who wants to understand the Supersoul?,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Someone in material consciousness cannot understand God? So then what of all these religions, for example, Muslim and Christian religion? Generally speaking, they don't even accept the existence of soul.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore they're not religion. They're cheating. This is not religion, this is cheating."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:So simply they're talking about God?,Prabhupāda,Yes. What is this?
Hari,"Hari-śauri:This isdobjuice, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no, you can keep that. Actually, there is no religion. In the name of religion, some farce is going on."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:That's a fact. You've said in the past, ""Devil citing scripture.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. They're eating meat. They have no even human sense. What is that religion? They have no even sense that ""I am cutting throat of one poor animal under my protection. If somebody cuts my throat, how much I am unhappy. And I'm doing the same business and I'm human being? How can I call myself a human being? I have no sense even of compassion."" Cats and dogs are passing on as religionists. Some hogs and pigs are going on as philosopher. And other animals is going as scientist, Darwin. They're animals only, cats and dogs. They are the leaders of the society. How you can expect any benefit from them? The leaders themselves are cats and dogs, pigs.Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥsaṁstutaḥpuruṣaḥpaśuḥ[SB2.3.19].These leaders, they aresaṁstutaḥ,they are very much worshiped. By whom?Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ.By the dogs, by the pigs, by the....śva-viḍ-varāha...,camel, and by the ass. Because these particular names, I have explained in theBhāgavata...So suppose one man has become lion, and he's praised by dogs, camels, asses, and pigs. Naturally, they will praise, ""Oh, sir, you are the king."" Does it mean he's king? He's animal. So it is going on. They are electing a big animal as president. And when he begins to eat, animal, big animal, then they protest, ""Oh, now he's not proper president. Get him down, get him down."" But why you sent him? ""Because we are pigs; we have no other knowledge. We another, appoint another big pig as our president."" Everything is explained in the Vedic literature. If you can present them properly, it will act. The voters areśva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-khara. And the president is another big animal. That's all. This is transaction of animal kingdom. A lion is the king of some asses, pigs, dogs, and hogs. What business you can expect there? This is their real picture. One who is a human being, he's seeing that how the animals are enjoying by voting and electing president. But they are thinking, ""We are busy in a very great business. We are electing president."" (laughter) This is going on. [break] ...you say that these rascal pigs, hogs, they elected president, and this president will eat them, and they will understand what kind of president they have elected. This thing is happening in the most advanced country ofUSA. And what to speak of other animal kingdom. Even the topmost state at the present moment, there also is happening the same thing. And what to speak of other small states."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Ifbhakti-yogais the..., one can only understandKṛṣṇathroughbhakti-yoga,why didKṛṣṇabother to explainkarma-yogaandjñāna-yogathrough so many...",Prabhupāda,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa: ""Because you are My very dear friend, I am speaking to you..."" It is to be spoken to the most confidential person. ""You are My dear friend; I am talking."" Other rascals will not understand. It is especially forArjuna, not for the common man."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:""...I am speaking to you this most confidential part of knowledge. Hear this from Me, for it is for your benefit.""",Prabhupāda,"""That is especial friendship and especial love; so I give you this. Keep it confidential."" This is real. Other rascals will not value this. They will protest, ""Huh? Why shall I surrender toKṛṣṇa?"""
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65].,Prabhupāda,"Sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].""So we have spoken so many other things for other rascals. But you are My friend, very intimate. I tell you, this is real fact."" So fact is fact. If you take earlier or later, that is different thing. You have to come.Bahūnāṁjanmanāmante[Bg.7.19].One has to take many births before coming to this understanding.Samahātmāsudurlabhaḥ.So everyone is notmahātmāeven, what to speak ofsudurlabhaḥ.(laughs) (end) That is the difficulty. Everyone sees that ""Some way or other, I becomeguru. Then so many persons will offer me respect. Somehow or other, create some situation. Then I becomeguru."" This is going on. Not bona fideguru. Bona fideguruis indicated byCaitanya,āmāraājñāyaguruhañā:""Becomeguru."" Why ambition? Actually becomeguru. But how to becomeguru?Yāredekha,tārekaha'kṛṣṇa-upadeśa'[Cc.Madhya7.128].That's it, otherwisegoru.So they will not take this simple method. They will drink, they will hunt after woman and have some attractive singing or dancing and becomeguru. What is meaning ofguru, they do not know. Somehow or other become popular and becomeguru. This is going on. So withmāyāyou can attract these foolish rascals very easily. If you can manufacture.... You cannot, but if you can show some jugglery, then you becomeguru. People are after all these things, material things. They are not afterKṛṣṇa. They are after money and women. So if you give somemantra,then gold will be manufactured, and all women will be attracted, very first class."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:You know, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they say that if anyone has power to induce anybody to chantHareKṛṣṇa, therefore they must have some special power. Therefore that's their qualification.",Prabhupāda,"That special power, that is said in theśāstras.But people do not want that."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Just like, for example, in Bengal before, there was that Charan das Babaji. He induced them to chant the wrongmantra,but where is.... He's not specificallyparamparā.",Prabhupāda,"No. He chanted for some time and, of course, there was chanting of ""Nitāi-Gaura."" He introduced new system of chanting:nitāi-gaurarādhe-śyāma.So theNitāi-Gaurachanting will have some effect,Kali-yuga. Although he was presenting pervertedly, the beginning wasNitāi-Gaura, so it would have some effect. He did not know actuallyNitāi-Gaura. From his words it appears. He used to preach thatNitāiis Rādhārāṇī, andGauraisKṛṣṇa. That issiddhānta-viruddha.But some way or other, he was chantingNitāi-Gaura. So some effect were there. Just like sandalwood. You do not know which way better pulp comes out, but if you rub any way, some pulp will come because it is sandalwood. So he had some effect of chantingNitāi-Gaura, but later on they deteriorated because they did not know actually, neither they were taught.Siddhānta-viruddha.Thesiddhānta-viruddhameans it will deteriorate. It will not endure."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about, say, many of your Godbrothers? They also have disciples, and they also are properly initiated by a proper spiritual master, and they give theHareKṛṣṇamantra.",Prabhupāda,"The thing is the spirit, real service of preaching, stopped. Formality is going on, but the real business....CaitanyaMahāprabhu's movement meansāmāraājñāyaguruhañātāraeideśa[Cc.Madhya7.128].That is stopped. Do you follow? The formalities is there, but the real life ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu's movement is preaching. Otherwise whyCaitanyaMahāprabhusays,āmāraājñāyaguruhañātāraeideśa.Tārameans preaching.Yāredekha,tārekaha'kṛṣṇa-upadeśa'[Cc.Madhya7.128].And that is stopped. They are satisfied if they could construct one temple and beg some rice from the neighborhood: ""Sir, we have got some temple,"" that's all. They are satisfied. The spirit of preaching forward-pāpītāpījatachilo,hari-nāme uddhārilo—that is stopped. So byhari-nāma,by chanting, by this way, to live little peacefully in the temple and eat and sleep, that much they have got. If that is the success, that success they have got. And this was condemned by myGuruMahārāja, that ""To earn some money by showing Deity in the temple and eat and sleep—better you become a sweeper in the street and earn your honest livelihood and live."" This is cheating. This was condemned. To construct a temple.... Just like theVṛndāvanaGosvāmīs are doing. They thought that ""This is our business. Some innocent people will come here and offer some....Bas,that's our good income."" According to the temple's popularity, they think, ""This is our success."" Therefore they are deteriorating. So that is not success. Success is his who is pushing forward the preaching method. That is his success. And if we think that ""By showing a temple Deity we get some money and rice and cloth and just peacefully live here. Don't bother about going to Fiji and all over..."" (laughs) That much success they have got. But that is notCaitanyaMahāprabhu.Pṛthivīteācheyatanagarādigrāma,sarvatrapracāra.What they are doing for that? That is point."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:What if sometimes disciple, he may go to preach, but he's not preaching in the exact same spirit of his spiritual master?",Prabhupāda,"Therefore he is not to be preached.CaitanyaMahāprabhusays,janmasārthakakari'karapara-upakāra:[Cc.Ādi9.41]""Go to do good to others. First of all you do good to yourself."" First of all you become really preacher. Then go to preach.CaitanyaMahāprabhunever sent neophyte to go to preach. For neophyte the preaching is not their business. For neophyte, one should stick to the worship of Deity in the temple. And those who have understood the philosophy, applied the philosophy in his life, he should go for preaching. Otherwise he'll preach wrongly, like.... What is that? Charan das Babaji. And it will stop. He wanted to preach, but he did not know how to preach, and therefore, after his life, it is finished. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhudoes not say like that, that ""You remain a rascal and go to preach."" No.Janmasārthakakari.""Your first business is that you make your life perfect. Then go to preach. Perfect means you learn how to obey My orders."" That is perfection.Āmāraājñāya.So if you are actually, perfectly carrying out the orders ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu, then you are preaching. Otherwise you will do wrongly, mislead. Don't do that.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31].If you remain blind, don't try to lead other blind men. That is misleading. First of all open your eyes. Everything is there. Nobody can do anything whimsically. If you do whimsically, concoctedly, that will be failure. It will not be effective."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Even though one may get many followers, that is not...",Prabhupāda,"Many? What you...? Many followers.... The philosophy you present, it must be followed by everyone. That is wanted. You have got, say, ten thousand followers. That does not mean success. Everyone has got some followers. This.... What is that? GurujiMaharaja. He has got also so-called followers. The T.M., he has got also some followers. Everyone has got some followers. But what kind of followers they have? That is quality. Everything has quality. Simply quantity is not. There are many Christians. Even up to date, some Christian fair or.... Many millions will come. What is the quality? Quality is all meat-eater. But Christian means he should not kill. Where is the Christian? So we have to test by the quality, followers. Not many followers, the quality of the followers. MyGuruMahārājaused to say like that, that ""If I get at least one quality disciple, then all my labor will be success."" He was saying like that: quality, not the quantity. By quantity if one is amazed, then he is alsogoru.By quality—what kind of followers? That is the.... From the very beginning my strictures are there, that ""You have to follow this""—quality. If I were..., ""No, you can do like Vivekananda. Yes, what you can, whatever you like,"" then I think quantity would have been very, very big. But I don't say. I make him promise before the fire, before the Deity, beforeguru. [break] That one moon is taken into account. Who takes account of the millions of stars?Ekaś candras tamohantinacatārāsahasraśaḥ.Quality. So we should be quality devotee, not quantity devotee. I have taken two glasses. Just see how nice water is, tap water. Here so manydobsare available, and this rascal is manufacturing RC and he is going as to be..., business. And for hearingBhagavad-gītāthey have no time, and they are trying to go toVṛndāvana. Quantity, not quality. So civilization should be quality civilization, not quantity civilization. Do that.Bheḍyadāsana. Bheḍyadāsana (indistinct).Bheḍī,lamb, they are going, hundreds and thousands. They flock. So, and if onebheḍī,lamb, is somehow or other pushed into slaughterhouse stockroom, so all the.... All of them. You haven't got to take many. Some way or other, you induce one of them to go into the, what is called, shed, where stocks are kept for taking out daily and killing. So they do not mind that ""We are being pushed into this room for future killing. Never mind. One has gone. Go."" They'll go. So this is called in Hindi,bheḍyadāsana,that without any consideration, ""One has entered. Let us all enter."" That isbheḍī,means animal, their disciple like this. They liked the ceremony?"
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:I think we should tell....Vāsudevadāsais getting hisbrāhmaṇathread this afternoon?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Are you giving him hisbrāhmaṇainitiation this afternoon?,Prabhupāda,He has come?
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:No.,Prabhupāda,We can do that tomorrow. So it has been settled where we are going?
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Well, I have to go to the airport this evening.",Prabhupāda,"No, withVāsudeva."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Yes. He is.... He thought it was best.,Prabhupāda,Don't do anything...
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:No, it was his suggestion because he doesn't want it to be another small program. He feels...",Prabhupāda,This is also cold water?
Hari,Hari-śauri:It was. It's still cold.,Prabhupāda,"Darwin's theory is body is changing, but why it is changing, he does not explain."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:It's because of nature. You can't explain nature. That's his only answer.,Prabhupāda,"Nature.... But we also say,prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāni[Bg.3.27].So it is to be understood that it is being done under superior control. If nature is doing, so nature is superior control. He cannot explain. So if he does not know how nature is working, then what is the value of his theory? If he says that he cannot explain how nature is doing, that means he is not expert. He may be mistaken. So why his opinion or decision should be taken final? He does not know how nature is working. That is not perfect knowledge. Does he say like that, ""Nature is working""?"
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Nature.,Prabhupāda,"So how nature is working, he does not know. Then his knowledge is imperfect. Nature is working how, that we know. That is very sober understanding. We say that nature is working under the superintendence ofKṛṣṇa.Mayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsūyatesa-carācaram[Bg.9.10].Nature.... We see nature. Generally we have got idea of the material nature, that the sun is one of the part and parcel of nature's working. The moon is also, the seasonal changes. So many things, nature is working very systematically. The summer season will appear exactly in the month of June and July. The fall begins in September every year. One can foretell that ""Next September this will happen,"" because nature's routine is very fixed up. So this systematic work of nature, how it is possible if there is no supervision?"
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:What they do is they just take it for granted because it's happening so regularly.,Prabhupāda,"So that means you have to accept it—there is superior administration. You may not know what is that administration, but you have to accept it. That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā.Kṛṣṇasays, ""Under My supervision."" Here those who are in the gross ignorance, not intelligent, they can suggest that there is some brain, just like Professor Einstein used to say. But he has no knowledge who is that brain, and we have that knowledge, who is that brain. That brain isKṛṣṇa. Therefore our knowledge is perfect. They can simply suggest that ""There is a brain,"" but we can say, ""Here is the brain."" Then it is.... If one knows whose brain it is, that is perfect knowledge."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:But they have no faith. That's the only difficulty.,Prabhupāda,"That is foolishness. You accept some brain. But if somebody comes who is accepted as the brain, they have no faith. That means rascal.Nāradasays, ""Here is the brain.""Brahmāsays, ""Here is the brain."" Śiva says, ""Here is the brain."" Thenācāryas,Vyāsadeva, says, ""Here is the brain."" Then modernācāryas,they say, ""Here is the brain."" Then why don't you accept? You are so rascal? Just like a person is going to London. So if he says, ""I have no faith that this Quantas will carry me to London,"" then how he will be convinced? How he'll be? If he says that ""I have no faith in this Quantas company, that it will carry me to London,"" and if he does not purchase the ticket—he has no faith—then who will be loser? The Quantas company will be loser and he will be loser. The rascal who says.... You can say that, that Quantas will carry him to London. You can say that. But if on account of this wrong faith if he does not purchase the ticket, then who will be loser? The Quantas will be loser or he will be loser? If you have no faith, then you are loser. You remain. Rot in this place. Do not try to go to London. What do you think? Eh?"
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):The traveler is the loser.,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:The traveler is the loser.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, traveler is the loser. If you have no faith, then loser, you are loser. You will never understand. Thereforeśāstrasays,Mahājanoyenagataḥsapanthāḥ[Cc.Madhya17.186].Big, big stalwartācāryas, mahājanas,they are accepting. Therefore we accept. That is sense. And if you sit down, ""No, no, I have no faith,"" you'll sit down and remain a rascal, that's all.Ādauśraddhā.Therefore faith is the first thing.Ādauśraddhā.If he has got intelligence, he'll see: ""So many big, big.... LordBrahmāaccepts. Lord Śiva accepts. Vyāsadeva accepts.Nāradaaccepts. Theācāryasaccept. So am I more than them? No. I will accept."" And that is perfection of....Mahājanoyenagataḥsapanthāḥ[Cc.Madhya17.186].And if still you remain faithless, then you are rascal. Same example can be.... Quantas. So many hundreds are purchasing ticket. They have also never seen London, but on faith they're purchasing ticket. So you have no faith, you don't purchase; therefore remain here. Without faith you cannot begin to work. The same example: You have gone to a barber shop. He is shaving, and people blindly, closing eyes, and he has got a razor. He can immediately cut. But why do you do this? Because you have faith that ""These people are professional barbers. They are shaving so many other people. They will not kill me. All right. Go on."" This is faith. And if you have no faith, then you will never have clean shaven. You go away. So beginning is faith, but faith should not be blind.Mahājanoyenagataḥsapanthāḥ[Cc.Madhya17.186].You have to take faith from great personalities. That is faith. Just like you American boys and girls. You began with faith. Without faith nothing can be....Ādauśraddhā.Just like people come, and they get some faith that ""So many people are following Swamiji."" So he associates for some time. Then he offers himself for initiation. This is the way.Ādauśraddhātataḥsādhu-saṅgo 'thabhajana-kriyā[Cc.Madhya23.14-15].Andbhajana-kriyā,if he agrees with spiritual master and takes his word, thenanartha-nivṛttiḥsyāt.Spiritual master says, ""You should not do this,"" and if he follows, then automatically his unnecessary burden is cleansed. This is the way. But faith is the beginning. And that is quite natural. Faith means by seeing others, respectable persons following, ""And why not I shall follow?"" That is faith. Faith is not also blind. You can see that so many others are doing, ""So why I myself?"""
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:This faith in the mundane religions, that cannot be called real faith.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is faith, but because one is not intelligent, he takes irreligion as religion. He does not.... He should be also very intelligent, faithful and intelligent. Not blind faith. He must be faithful, and intelligence.... He must know what is actually religion. So thereforesādhu-saṅga[Cc.Madhya22.83].Associate withsādhusmeans those who are actually on the platform. So if he associates with thesādhu—thesādhusacceptKṛṣṇaas the Supreme Personality of Godhead—he will get the understanding thatKṛṣṇais the Supreme Lord. Then his faith becomes fixed up inKṛṣṇa. This is the way."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:So what is the exact meaning of that verse,śraddhā-śabde.That verse...",Prabhupāda,"Yes,śraddhā.That faith increase, and when it is increased so much that he fully understands, ""By worshipingKṛṣṇa, everything is done,"" that is first-class faith.Śraddhā-śabdeviśvāsakahesudṛḍhaniścaya[Cc.Madhya22.62].If he becomes fixed up, ""Yes,Kṛṣṇais the Supreme Personality,"" that is first-class, means fulfillment of faith. In the beginning it might be doubtful, neophyte. But when that is, that faith is fixed up, ""Yes,Kṛṣṇais the Supreme Personality,"" that is the fulfillment of faith. Faith also there are different stages, improvement. Devotional service means different grades of faith. Today I am in one stage of faith, next day another stage, next day another stage, next day another stage. And when you come to the stage thatvāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19],oh, that is final.Samahātmāsudurlabhaḥ.That takes time. And quickly also, if one is fortunate. If one is intelligent—""Theśāstrasays, 'Vāsudeva is everything,' so why not takeVāsudevaeverything?""—then he gains the result immediately. And if he thinks, ""All right, let me see for some time,"" so he may waste his time, but the point is the same. Point is the same, but he has not developed his faith to such extent. You have to wait. And intelligent person, he says, ""Why shall I wait? Let me take finallyvāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19].That business is finished.""Samahātmā.Therefore it is said,samahātmāsudurlabhaḥ.That kind of staunch faith is not very easy.

That means rascal, overintelligent. Overintelligent means rascal. Intelligence means you must have reason. And if he is going beyond reason, only depending on himself, then he is overintelligent rascal. You understand overintelligent rascal? Don't be overintelligent. That is very risky. Be intelligent. Overintelligent means rascal. Spoiling. Just like milk. You are heating, and if you give overheat, spoil so many. That kind of heating is not required. You just push on heat as much required.

Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Approach. Approach. One must become perfect to start with. One must approach a perfect spiritual master and he must become perfect disciple. Could you explain that?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He should follow spiritual master. Then he is perfect disciple. Bring water with ice. (end) Never mind he's very nicely dressed. But because he is not surrendered soul toKṛṣṇa, he is a miscreant. That's all Beware of him."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Can anyone be said to be innocent in this world?,Prabhupāda,"There are three classes: one devotee, one innocent, and one envious. So we have nothing to do with the envious. With devotee, we shall make friendship, and to the innocent, we shall preach."

Devotee:,"Devotee:Śrīla Prabhupāda, once you told a man, ""What is your definition of God?"" And he could not answer. And you answered him that ""God means the Supreme Being.""

Sinful means that is the cause of their becoming envious. [break] ...law. Religion means the order of God. Simple definition.Dharmaṁtusākṣādbhagavat-praṇītam[SB6.3.19].Just like law, we keep to the right or left, order of the government. One who obeys this law, he's good citizen. One who disobeys, he's rascal. Similarly,dharmameans the order of God. So one who obeys the order of God, he is really religious. One who does not, he's rogue,duṣkṛtina.This is simple. [break]....

""God is this, and sometimes God is this""—that is no understanding of God. You must have clear understanding of God."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:What is the quality of a person who is actually faithful?,Prabhupāda,"He's accepting eagerlyBhagavad-gītāif he's really follower of God. Because there is nothing extraordinary in theBhagavad-gītā.It is the words actually for God to speak. You may callKṛṣṇaor otherwise, but....

If I can subsist by taking onecāpāṭi,I'll simply ask for onecāpāṭi,not for twocāpāṭis.That isśāstra.If you can without anycāpāṭi,that is very good. But you can ask as much as you require. Not to eat sumptuously and sleep twenty-four hours, no."
Devotee:,Devotee:And what about householders?,Prabhupāda,"Householder can eat the whole world and sleep. (laughter) Because he is householder, he has got the concession. Everyone should do that. Householders are unable; that is their incapability. ""Because I am householder, I have got the facility to have sex as many times and eat as much..."" That is not householder.

Hari,"Hari-śauri:Oh, yeah. During the war.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Hari,Hari-śauri:Yes. So sinful means punishment. (indistinct),Prabhupāda,"Our point is that we are going to live in the future. So if, becoming modern, we forget our future, then what is the use of becoming modernized? Better remain primitive. The business is that in future also we shall exist. If we do not know how we shall exist—either I shall exist as a cat, as a dog, or a tree, or a demigod, or as associate ofKṛṣṇa.... If I do not know.... On account of being modernized, if I remain in darkness about my future, so it is better to remain primitive. What is the use of becoming modernized and forget myself and my future? Becoming modernized, if I become dog in future, so what is the use of modernized? The real business is that I shall take care of my future. Especially in the human form of body. Cats and dogs, they do not know about future. If I know there is future, I have a future.... This is also said byKṛṣṇa.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ:[Bg.2.13]""In future."" Not this body, another body. So is it not my first business, to prepare what is my future body? That is my first business? Or to drink R.C. (Royal Crown?) my first business? Just see. By drinking R.C. if I, next life I become a dog, then what is the use of modernized life? And if we, by remaining in primitive state, we can produce Vyāsadeva, oh, it is better. But the fools have no sense. Suppose if I go to some place for some business, and going there, to select my hotel, which hotel I shall enter, I remain busy to find out the hotel, and I forget the business for which I have gone there, then am I not madman? A human life is meant for deciding his future. If we do not care for the future, and if I want to become modernized from primitive life, is that very good inclination? Real business forgotten, but I am busy with modernized life. That example I give sometimes, (Bengali). That one has to go to see a fair on account of (Bengali). So women, they generally dress themself very nicely. So the woman say to his friend that ""You dress."" So dressing, dressing, dressing.... In the meantime, the fair finished. So the modern civilization is like that. (Bengali) I have to go to see the fair, but I became so much attentive in dressing that in the meantime news came, ""The fair is finished."" That is our civilization. A human life is meant for preparing for the next life. That is sensible. But I am so much busy in manufacturing things for modernized life, R.C., T.C., P.C., and so on, so on. In future, at the time of death, I begin to bark and I think, ""Oh..."" And nature will say, ""All right, come on."" ""No, no, I'm not going to..."" No, why not? You have become modernized, barking like dog. So you bark. Who will check that?Daivīhyeṣāguṇa-mayīmamamāyā...[Bg.7.14].māyāwill take consideration, ""What you have made yourself, a dog or god?"" That she will take account. If you have made yourself a dog, ""Just come on, become a dog."" If you have made yourself as god, then ""Come on, you'll be demigod."" That is for everything. Otherwise why there are varieties? There is dog life and there is demigod life,Indralife. It is not one-sided.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13],it is not one-sided. You have to change your body. And there are varieties of life, so it is up to you what kind of body you have got. You can change your body up to the point of becoming associate ofKṛṣṇa.Mad-yājino 'piyāntimām[Bg.9.25].Yadgatvānanivartantetaddhāma...[Bg.15.6].These informations are there. So if you have to prepare for the next life, why not go back to home, back to Godhead?Yadgatvānanivartante.This is intelligent? Or to become modernized and become a dog next life? Which is intelligent? Theśāstrasays, ""No, this is intelligent."" What?Tapodivyaṁputrakāyenaśuddhyedsattvam[SB5.5.1].This life should be utilized fortapasya,to purify your existence. That is theśāstra. Śāstradoes not say you become modernized. What is this modernized? Simply waste of time."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Polished.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Polished dogs.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Actual modernized means how far you have advanced in spiritual consciousness. That is wanted. (drinks or eats) It does not taste exactlydahl,I think, due to the new (indistinct) water in it. So is there any engagement? Somebody was to come."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Was to come, but...",Prabhupāda,He is not coming. Who is not modernized? They will go to the dancing party for their salvation. (laughter) Dog dancing.
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Today is Sunday. Everyone is busy with their family, family, society.",Prabhupāda,You know thisRaviShankar?
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Umm hmm.,Prabhupāda,"His elder brother, Udar Shankar, he became very famous man as a dancer, all over the world. Udar Shankar. And by imitating his brother, theRaviShankar also tried to become first-class sitarist. So family.... [break] ...was a little famous for artistic.... So that Udar Shankar was dancing in the Indian way, and there are many sculpture of dancing. Like that. That was his art. So he became famous."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:He's not living? He's dead?,Prabhupāda,"No, he's dead means now he's old man. He's about my age or little older than me. Now his skin has become slackened and body is not so strong to dance. It requires exercise. Therefore he's retired, I think, maybe dead. But I don't hear his name. He was more or less known in Europe as Shankar. But he was so popular that one my doctor friend.... He was educated in London, a medical officer of Allahabad. So he told me that ""I saw that in Paris, Udar Shankar's dancing was advertised, and hundreds and thousands of people from England going to Paris, crossing the Channel to see him dance."" He showed me. He's so popular. And now nobody asks for him. (laughs)"
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Another bubble.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Another bubble. I remember whenRaviShankar and George Harrison came to see you inVṛndāvana.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:The first thing you asked them was ""You are very famous, but what will you be next life? What is your guarantee for the next life?""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:And I don't think any otherguruwould have asked that.,Prabhupāda,"Where isguru?Goru,you saygoru.When it is pronouncedguru, I say, you say, don't sayguru, but you saygoru."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Goru.,Prabhupāda,"Goru,no, do you knowgoru?Gorumeans cow."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Cow. (laughs),Prabhupāda,"(laughing) Otherwise they're going to find out, then don't saygoru.Guru."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Guru.,Prabhupāda,"Gorumeans cow.Śrī-guru-caraṇa-padma. Śrī-guru.(laughs) So they're allgorus,nobodyguru."
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"All rascals. Now thatRaviShankar has become Georgeguru. Somebody.... You were telling me? That this boy has been taught to take the dust of the feet ofRaviShankar in the stage, and people did not like it. So he has become unpopular accepting agoru.(end) ...by taking birth of any, whether the tree is taking birth or the ant is taking birth and the fish is taking birth. Everywhere, living entities, they are taking birth, that's all. And they are dying also. And between birth and death there is disease and old age. So during birth one cannot understand, because there is unconscious stage. So even the fetus is killed, it cannot under..., because fully unconscious stage. And there is life undoubtedly; otherwise how the fetus all of a sudden gets life? But thesemūḍhascannot see it. Here in this matter there is no life; therefore many thousands of years, if you kill, it will never show any symptom of life. But if there is life, at a time it will come to consciousness. Just like fainted man is lying like a dead man, but he is not dead. There is life. It is fainted, unconscious state. So because there is life, he may lie down in that unconscious state for two, three hours; again he'll come. It is common sense. And if a log, wood log, is lying flat, will it come to life, anything? But because thesemūḍhas,they are taking that ""Fetus has no life. Kill it, finish it and eat it."" It is going on. You know that?"
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:I imagined that it would soon go on, on a mass scale, that...",Prabhupāda,"No, it will go, because they are becoming moremūḍhas.There is no intelligence. Therefore I say that we are giving this intelligence. This is the only movement to make thesemūḍhasintelligent. This is the only movement. Otherwise they are becoming more and more and more and moremūḍhas.So under the circumstances, if we also becomemūḍhas,then who will make the othermūḍhasintelligent? That is my point. There are so many things. I'll begin this, I mean to say, recitation of Sixth Canto. There are so many nice instructions. So this... [break]...even they are kept to remain asmūḍhas,all other so-called attempts... There are many other attempts for awakening the human society to right platform, but their basic principle is wrong. They cannot do it. It is not possible. (pause) So there is nokīrtana?"
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Yeah. At seven. Theāratikais at seven. Ten minutes. Now it'stulasīworship.,Prabhupāda,"So this movement should be pushed very vigorously. And so far, we have become successful. And enemies will be always, as soon as there is something good. That is the way of material world. EvenKṛṣṇahad enemies, what to speak of us. Eh? So many enemies, but He was powerful; He killed all them. Nobody could kill Him, but there was attempt to kill Him from the very beginning of His birth. He had so many enemies. As soon asKaṁsaheard that his sister is now newly married, but as soon as there was some foretelling, ""Ah, you are taking care of your sister so nicely. The eighth child of this sister will kill you."" ""Oh, where is your child? Where is pregnancy?"" Nothing. He became angry. ""So why wait for eighth child? Kill my sister."" Long, long before taking birth ofKṛṣṇa, the mother was to be killed. This is the position of this material world. So he became so bad that ""My sister..."" He did not consider that ""She is my sister, and she is just newly married. Where is pregnancy? Where is child? And that is the eighth child, and what will happen after that?"" No consideration. Immediately, ""Kill him, kill her."" This is the position. So we are instructing: no intoxication. So those who are flourishing by selling cigarettes and wine and liquor, they do not... ""Immediately kill him."" Oh, yes, in this way. ""If they, the movement goes and becomes very strong, then our business will be lost. Kill him."" So naturally they will be enemies. The same thing, theKaṁsasaw that ""This my sister, now she is married. So although it will take some long time, but here is the cause."" So they are thinking like that. No meat-eating, then all slaughterhouses will be closed: ""They're enemy."" Although there is no such symptom that slaughterhouse is going to be closed, but they'll think like that. They'll think like that, the same way. There is no ex... [break] ...pregnancy, first, second, third, then eighth, and the child will go, take birth and... They are thinking like that. So the modern civilization, we are everyone saying. Because you have forbidden: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling. The whole Western world living on these four pillars. Just see our position. And the same conscious way, everyone is thinking, ""If this movement goes on, then how all these nightclubs will go on? How all breweries will go on? How all slaughterhouse will go on, cigarette factories will go on?"" This is all foolish. So you cannot expect that we will get more, many friends. That is not possible, because the world is full of Kaṁsas, demons. So we have to struggle and... In the face of so many obstacles we have come to this standard that there is oneHareKṛṣṇamovement; it is very dangerous to the modern way of life. That much is great, advance. They're feeling the pulse. Now when they are meeting, state obstacles. Everywhere we are meeting obstacles. In Singapore."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:We went to the airport.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:And practically they didn't even want to let us stay in the airport. We had to stay there only for four hours to catch the next flight. They are so much...,Prabhupāda,"This is our position. Gradually they will showHareKṛṣṇamovement. In India also, although India's... They will want to crush down this movement. So this will be up to Him.Kṛṣṇaor Kṛṣṇa's movement, the same thing. AndKṛṣṇawas attempted to be killed byKaṁsaclass of men and his company, the demons. So it will be there; it is already there. Don't be disappointed, because that is the meaning that it is successful. Kṛṣṇa's favor is there, becauseKṛṣṇaand Kṛṣṇa's movement is not different, identical. So asKṛṣṇawas attempted to be killed, many, many years before He appeared... At eighth child, if the mother produces child yearly, still ten years, eight years before His birth, the mother was to be attempted to be killed. So there may be attempt like that. And Lord Jesus Christ was killed. So they may kill me also."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:I don't think that is possible.,Prabhupāda,"No, I mean to say, I am not so important man. But it is the, this is the way of the law. If we become weak by factioning, then that is not good. We must be strong and... But you do not expect that this movement will be accepted. In India the so-called yogis,RamaKrishna Mission—they are also being afraid of. There are so many... But if we remain sincere, even we are feeble, new-born, nobody can kill us. That is a fact. Just likeKṛṣṇawhen He was three months old, attempt was made byPutanāto kill Him, but thePutanāwas killed. A big demon, gigantic, six miles long, and what is killed by a small child playing on the..., sucking breast and sucking life. That isKṛṣṇa. So the other day I have explained that byguru, he is accepted as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You have typed it?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Go on. Yes,arcyeviṣṇauśilā-dhīrguruṣunara-matiḥ. Narakī,if anyone thinksarca-vigraha,the Deities as made of stone, made of earth, or made of something material, andguru, the spiritual master, ""He is an ordinary man""—these are forbidden. So whyguruis to be consideredsākṣād dharitvenasamasta-śāstrair **,exactly (like) the Supreme Personality of Godhead? That reason is given there. That reason is that he is giving theKṛṣṇaknowledge; therefore he is as good asKṛṣṇa. Even though his family members or his friend thinking, ""Oh, he has now becomeguru,"" still he should be considered the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That reason also given there, that evenKṛṣṇawas taken as ordinary man, but does it mean that He has become ordinary? Similarly any..., our movement, it may appear just like other movement, but because the movement is givingKṛṣṇa, that means it is as good asKṛṣṇa. This is the example.Ajñāyaha&#241a(follow the order). It may appear to others... And there are so many movements, and the hippies have taken another say(?), but it is not that. It is actuallyKṛṣṇa. So long it adheres to the principle, ""I'll enjoy, I'll be unaccepted(?)."" Otherwise it is ordinary movement. This same man, he'sguru, so long he gives the real knowledge ofKṛṣṇa. And the same man, he's ordinary man, as soon as he cannot give. Same thing, just like a stone doll, when it is worshiped according to the regulative principles—Kṛṣṇa. And the same doll, kept in the sculptor's showroom, it is stone. So if we keep our movement pure, then you are as strong asKṛṣṇa. And as soon as you deviate from it, immediately, ordinary. This is the secret. Now it is up to us, how to keep it pure. Then no enemy can kill us. Nobody can kill you. That purity is wanted, then it will... So what is there difficulty? Their purity to kill him(?). Follow the rules and regulations, worship the Deity, and chantHareKṛṣṇamantra,as you have given, then you will remain as strong asKṛṣṇa. And if we manufacture some idea also, that is no good.Kṛṣṇacannot be manufactured;KṛṣṇaisKṛṣṇa. You cannot manufacture another form competitor ofKṛṣṇa. That is no good. Then failure. Just like the, your one competitor came to, even in the lifetime ofKṛṣṇa,Pauṇḍraka."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"With artificial four hands. You know that? (laughs) That is no (indistinct). This movement is actually the real movement to raise the human society. And if we create factions, then the movement will be less strong and will not act very (indistinct). (pause) Australian dollar question is solved with you? And this check can be deposited."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:I think it will turn out OK.,Prabhupāda,But this dealing of the bank is very...
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Not good. I know. I complained to the bank manager also.,Prabhupāda,So this is right.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:They said their hands were tied because the specimen signature on the check...,Prabhupāda,They give me writing check.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Why you are talking? Give me writing, that this is not bona fide. Then we take this step, ""Your check nonpayment: we will have to take steps."" ""We wanted this money; we have deposited the money there, and you are not paying. What is this?"""
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:We are being inconvenienced by...,Prabhupāda,"""So now you have to pay the balance. We did not carry the money, took a check, and immediately pay, now you have detained it. So you give me in writing why you are not paying. Then we shall take steps. We should not be punished."" Sometimes they take advantage, ""Oh, he is servant(?) class, he must be fool number one."" (chuckles) They think it. [break] ...no loss or commission."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Not on the check.,Prabhupāda,"Check, there is no question. They can deposit immediately in our account. It is cashier's check; it has to be cashed immediately. So did you ask about the dollars, despatching to India?"
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:No, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:They said they would...,Prabhupāda,"No, no difficult, but what is rate?"
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:The rate, ah, 11.34 American cents equals one rupee.",Prabhupāda,11.34.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yes. I haven't converted into how many... I can do that.,Prabhupāda,"11.34, that is good rate. So I wish that... We should combine the work very vigorously when this (indistinct). They are just like women, equal in preaching (indistinct). You keep some women together, and they fight. The children together, they will fight. Dogs together, they will fight. Sane man, why they will fight? Where is the cause of fight? Then you are (indistinct) to become woman. Worse. This material world is such that even you keep some utensil together, when dealing,tung, tung, tung, tung, tung,what to speak of individuals souls. But our cause is the common, how to push on. That soberness must be there. I can give you points, instructions, you will have to put it into shape; otherwise how it will go on?"
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:We can understand that Your Divine Grace does not want factions.,Prabhupāda,That will better the movement.

If one becomes initiated and he still keeps the hippie form, that does not look nice. Do you think that is all right? No, that is not good.

The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.""",Prabhupāda,"You have to submit. You cannot remain independent. That is the first condition.Śiṣyaste'haṁ,śiṣya. Śiṣyameans voluntarily accepting the rules offered by the spiritual master. That isśiṣya:""Ah, yes, I agree to abide by your order."" Then he becomesśiṣya.Otherwise where is the question... ""I am thinking like this, I am thinking..."" So long you are thinking otherwise, you don't try to become aśiṣya.You remain outside and you are welcome: chant, dance, takeprasādam,and remain independent. There is no objection. But when you becomeśiṣya,then you cannot remain independent. These things convince him. Then you don't becomeśiṣya.Remain as friend, there is no harm. Just like so many people, they come. So if these things (indistinct). One thousand twenty, checks (indistinct). This way. What is the wrong there?"
Hari,Hari-śauri:So then part of initiation means that you're prepared to do something more than simply chant and eatprasādam?,Prabhupāda,"Initiation means to follow instructions of the spiritual master. That is the first (indistinct) And if there is still hesitation to surrender to the rules and regulations, then all other (indistinct)."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:I think it is pretty clear, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's just for clarification, that they're working, they have a store on..., a very nice store, they're distributing foodstuffs to all the other stores on the island, and they're working a lot within the society with thekarmīs,I guess. So their thinking is that ""If we shave our heads and wear robes, like that, then they'll look at us...",Prabhupāda,"That is not... Because imitating. Officially don't chant. Who is prohibiting to chant? You can chant, you can dance, you can takeprasādam."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Can they actually say that ""His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda is my spiritual master"" if they haven't accepted all of the instructions?",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Can one actually say that my spiritual master is such-and-such person if I am not following all of the...,Prabhupāda,"What is the use of following (indistinct). We have got that simple thing, you can follow. What is the use? False propaganda. Because you think that we could not accept... (indistinct) ...we are trying to follow the (indistinct)."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:One of the differences that first sprung up between the two groups was that one group was going out when you were saying ""Go out and distribute books profusely,"" so they were going and distributing. And they had various means of doing it. Some were not so good, but still the books were going out. Then the group that split away, they were saying, ""Ah, you're disturbing the public by these methods of book distribution. We don't want..."" This is what happened in Australia, the one temple in Brisbane. They became very much against thesaṅkīrtanamethods, and as a result they gave up thesaṅkīrtanaprogram altogether and then went to live on farms like this, and they left the temple and the temple was finished. So like this, they were saying that ""We're still following Prabhupāda's instructions, but we..."" But they were saying that the devotees who were distributing the books, they were not following instructions. Like that.",Prabhupāda,"His Divine Grace has said that ""You distribute book,"" and why do you say that?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Well, their idea was that because sometimes the public is becoming disturbed by the book distribution, then therefore it's not being done correctly. So it should be stopped.",Prabhupāda,"Public may disturb, but we are following our own course of action. It is not obligatory. We are requesting you, ""Take this book."" That is not obligatory. ""If you like, you can take. If you don't like, don't take."""
Hari,"Hari-śauri:So what their idea was that we shall build some public relations, like you said with this store. They prefer to try to spreadKṛṣṇaconsciousness by public relations, give good impression, and then people will come.",Prabhupāda,"Then you are dictated by the public, not by the dictation of your spiritual master. Spiritual master has ordered to distribute books; you shall do that. That is obedience. Now the public may take or not take, that is public's option. But my duty is—because spiritual master has said—I must try my best. Spiritual master has not said that ""You must sell so many books daily, otherwise I will reject you."" He has not said that. So everyone may try his best, that's all. The public may take or not take, it doesn't matter. And if you are, want to please the public, public says that ""You dance naked, I will be very happy with you, I'll give you (indistinct)."" So I'll have to do that. Then what is the use of making a spiritual master? Public, they have got their whims, how to become pleased. So we are to follow all these things? We have to follow our instruction of the spiritual master. That is... (indistinct) Why to manufacture ""The public will be pleased like this""? Public may or may not give you, what you can do?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Our success is in the spiritual master's pleasure, not the public's pleasure.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that isbhakti.Otherwise whyKṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66]? ""You haven't got to please so many religious instructions. You simply please Me."" That is Kṛṣṇa's..."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:I don't think the devotees who factioned out were against book distribution. I think that a little bit was that some of the devotees were using very, very forceful tactics and trying to give people books and take their money, and people were becoming very offended...",Prabhupāda,That is not (indistinct).
Hari,"Hari-śauri:This is what happened. The temples fell down, the devotees went away. The ones who were distributing the books went on and distributed more books, became more expert, so that the public were not so much disturbed, and still they're distributing books. But these people who factioned off are not distributing books even now, two or three years later. So it was simply actually a question of faultfinding more than earnest desire to please the spiritual master.",Prabhupāda,Yes. (pause) Discuss.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:...come Sunday easily. Charge them.... You know like in Los Angeles, we used to charge a dollar a...",Prabhupāda,The loan will be clear very soon.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Oh, yes. They have a.... They are very expert at financing now, these, the men who are in charge now. They're claiming that within two or three months all of the debt will be completely cleared. They have a plan, very easy.",Prabhupāda,(chuckles) He is the right person.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. And the restaurant is very successful. Also they have not advertised that, but every day about fifty people come for the lunch, and at least another seventy, eighty people come in the evening for dinner. For a full meal each person pays an average about $2.50.",Prabhupāda,That's cheap.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:All you can eat for two dollars...,Prabhupāda,And for public it is very cheap.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Very inexpensive. And if they advertise it, they won't be able to handle all the people who come. It's such a central location.",Prabhupāda,"It will be automatically advertised. When people will say, ""Oh, there is a nice ISKCON restaurant, and it is so cheap and so nice,"" people will come. Just like in ourVṛndāvanatemple, we don't advertise. Of course, that's.... People are coming by thousands. I thought that so long distance from the city, nobody will come. ButBalarāmais so powerful, He's bringing: ""Come out here."" (laughter) Otherwise, I was.... What is that? Plowing?Yamunāwas threatened."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Oh,Balarāma.",Prabhupāda,And the wholeKurudynasty was threatened.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Very good class of people are coming to the restaurant, businessmen, like that.",Prabhupāda,And there is book display?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Oh, yes. Oh, yes, there's a book display.",Prabhupāda,They are purchasing book also?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. They give them aBack to Godhead,complimentary copy...",Prabhupāda,Ācchā.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:...with the meal. And then they also purchase books. The buses are going on nicely. All the buses are out. Two more buses are being made now.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, you are adding two more."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. Well, we had almost finished two. They'll be added in June, so that will make eight, a total of eight. And they're having a normal program going on nicely. And MadhudviṣaMahārājaalso went to visit the other temples. He said in Boston they've gotten.... I think they've already gotten it, right? That restaurant?AmbarīṣaPrabhuhas gotten the most wonderful restaurant there, just around the corner from the temple. So it will be very, very high class restaurant with waiters, and...",Prabhupāda,"Now, this New York restaurant being organized, other restaurant will follow."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:This restaurant down here, I just was there.Gaura-govinda, he's the one who decorated it. First class. People really like it.",Prabhupāda,"From the very beginning I was asking to open restaurant and farm. Producegheein the farm and send to the restaurant, and make nicesamosā, kachoripreparation, and there will be no scarcity of money. And if you organize in this way, your whole country will be transferred intoKṛṣṇaconscious country. Whole country. So, what about your China program?"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Well, we went to New York to meet withDhṛṣṭadyumnaMahārāja's father, and he was very helpful. We approached him in a frank way, and he immediately got the help of his office. He's the president of this Far East American Council.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. And not only China, this is for all of Asia. It includes as.... Some of the persons belonging to it are the chairman of Coca-Cola, the Bankers Trust Company first vice president, all of the big banks, Bank of America senior vice president, First National City Bank vice president, all of these men.",Prabhupāda,"So you can contract with all big, big men."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. And he's the president of the council.,Prabhupāda,His father?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Then he is very influential man.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Very. So he immediately got...,Prabhupāda,So you should be like father like son.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:He has the same name. It's just ""Junior"" at the end, so they know him.",Prabhupāda,"No, intelligence also. Father's intelligence he must inherit. There is an Indian proverb,bāpakā beṭā sepāikāghoḍā, kucha nehi tothoḍāthoḍā (indistinct),mean ""The father's son and the soldier's horse, they acquire the quality, if not all, some, must."" If one is good soldier, his horse is also trained up. There is a history in India. The horse has played heroic. The Queen of Jhansi's horse and this, our, what is called, Shivaji's horse, they have played unique part in the history.Sepāikāghoḍā.It is animal, but because it is the horse of a famous hero, it has played. Similarly, the son of father must be as good as father. If not, to some extent. Yes. So you are the.... Your father is the leader of so many big, big businessmen. You also become leader."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,ForKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,ForKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And you have got the intelligence. I have seen. I have studied you. Now you combine. Both of you, you are intelligent. You turn the whole AmericaKṛṣṇaconscious.Bas.Then success all over the world. America is the leader of the nations. Now, if the America becomesKṛṣṇaconscious, then our movement is perfectly successful. And you have got the potency in America."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:These men are all in Asia, though. His father's biggest concern.... See, his father.... The company is divided into two: the American branch of Seagrams, and the overseas, which incorporates the whole world outside of America. His father is the president of overseas. So his father has all connections with all of the embassies overseas, all of the big corporations overseas.",Prabhupāda,"So all these big, big men, let them have one set of books and study. It is not any expenditure for them, but if at their leisure hour they read some of the line—they are all intelligent men-they'll get ideas, what is thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So through the influence of father, just try to introduce our books to these big men. It is not.... They may keep them in library, and at leisure hour, if they simply glance over the line, oh, it will be great success."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,And their sons will also read it.,Prabhupāda,Their sons also will read.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Already my father has noticed in his travels that some of his friends, their sons have joined our movement now too.",Prabhupāda,"Yadyadācaratiśreṣṭhaḥ, lokastadanuvartate[Bg.3.21].If these big men of the world, they take it, ""Oh, yes.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is genuine,"" then naturally it will be followed by the others. So here is a good opportunity to contact big men of the world. So utilize it properly. You.... Both of you are intelligent. Very cautiously deal with them. They will understand that ""Oh, these people are very honest men of character and high knowledge and God conscious."" That will make our movement success."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:His father has been giving us.... Of course, it was.... We have been approaching him through the aspect of doing business in China. His father is encouraging us in the sense that he is seeingDhṛṣṭadyumna.... Like whenever we visit him, we come in our suits, and his father is seeing that.... He is encouraging him also because he's taking some, what he calls a very, what would you say, a responsible position, attempting to do some business. So he's been giving us letters on his company's letterhead. Just like this is a letter to the director of the Department of Commerce of the United States. We've seen a number of people. We've been visiting different directors. First thing we did when we went back is after meeting him, we got many books on China. Some of the examples are, just like this.... We read about twenty-five books. We've studied up very thoroughly and researched everything about China. Here is a book,The Religious Policy and Practice in Communist China.It describes everything about religion there. So we thoroughly read this book. Then there's other books, books on education, we read books on history...",Prabhupāda,"Chinese people, they are trying to raise their standard of civilization. Do they?"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:First we got a lot of information ourselves, so we'd be knowledgeable. We read for one month. We got.... We wrote away to all the councils, we got hundreds of books like this, special reports about China, we read them, and then we went to meet this man, because he is the most knowledgeable expert person on China in the United States. And we made up a report which we wanted to read to you, because it gives everything very nicely. It tells what China is doing now, and what our program can be for book distribution.",Prabhupāda,"No, what is their aim? After studying all these books, what do you think? What is the aim of China? What is the objective they are making progress towards?"
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Their aim is that everyone should be materially comfortable. There should be no...,Prabhupāda,"In that case, they should, if they have got sense.... Just like in the whole world, these American people are materially comfortable. But why they are producing hippies now?"
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"They see this as a fault of the system, capitalism. They say that capitalism means the enjoyment of the few at the...",Prabhupāda,Materialism means capitalism.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Well, they want communistic materialism. In other words, by creating, forming communes, everyone will get equal portion of food and bedding and clothing and medicine.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is not the fact. A man's tendency is that everyone wants to get more. So how they will check it? This is already proved in Russia."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They condemn Russia. They say Russia is a failure.,Prabhupāda,"And similarly, they will have to condemn. If they follow the wrong path, they will have the wrong result. This is not..."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Artificial, though.",Prabhupāda,"So that is artificial way of.... Unless one is prepared to.... Just like why they are inducing persons to sacrifice their accumulated wealth for the state? Why? Communistic idea that everyone should be equal. So if somebody has more than others, they want to take it away. Just like in India this policy is now growing. So everyone should give away, but now it is being done by law, by force. But that will not stay."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:We also agree it's a failure.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:It is bound to fail.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Unless you voluntarily give, it will be failure. You will try to find out ways how you can take everything.... Just like income tax. The government is trying to take more money from the public, and public is hiding them in black market. This is going on. Nobody is.... Even your Nixon, he also hidden some money from the income tax. Why? He is the head of the government. So one side, he is head of the government, try to take money from the public, but he personally himself, he is hiding. Why this defect?"
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"They will say that the system encourages man's greed, whereas their system...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, system.... If the.... You cannot change the mind. If you have got mind to enjoy more, by force if I try to force you not to enjoy more, give to the state, this is a struggle. This is not perfect process."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They say that will be corrected by education.,Prabhupāda,Education.... That means what is that education?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:They say that the.... They don't.... Of course, we say education meansKṛṣṇaconsciousness.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Education means they must learn to sacrifice everything for the topmost.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:They say the topmost is the general mass of everyone, the proletariat, all people combined.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right, general. But you know how to make general mass of people happy. That example we give, that the whole body.... You can make the whole body happy simply by supplying food to the stomach. That is the best way. And if you want to make happy every part of the body, individual, that will never be successful. You must know where to touch. Just like the huge machine is going on by the expert manipulation of the pilot. He is pushing one.... Works. Immediately the plane becomes.... It is.... So you must know where to touch. If.... I am layman, I am put into that, then, instead of putting here, I shall put my here, and then it will go down. ""Ohhh."" So finished. So this is nature's way, that you supply food to the stomach, and the energy will be distributed every part. You supply water to the root of the tree, it will be supplied everywhere. That you must know. Otherwise, if you.... Just like if you do not know, a expert, not expert, so he's advised, ""Give to, the food to the stomach."" ""And in where?"" ""No, in the hole of the body."" If he does not, which hole, then he will put somewhere, sometimes here, sometimes here, sometimes here, sometimes here. It will never act. Then you must know the science how to make everyone happy. If you do not know that, then your imperfect imagination will never be done, and that has become everywhere. Why there is difference of opinion even both of the communistic countries? Why there is difference of opinion between Russia and China? Because both of you do not know how to make everyone happy. That is the point."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"China has achieved great material strides in the last twenty years. There is no prostitution. They have wiped out flies, no more flies causing disease. There is.... And they look to a very bitter past of exploitation at the hand of foreigners and internal civil war and great suffering and starvation. So when they look back over twenty years they see, ""Oh, we have advanced greatly."" So they are very satisfied.",Prabhupāda,"No, if they actually progressing, they will have to come to that point—that is natural—where, placing your service, you can serve everyone. That is the right conclusion. But we have got that right conclusion. If you take from us you can make immediately. But if you want to wait by your research work, then you can waste your time. But you have to come to this point. That is a fact. Just like you have to give food to the mouth. If you do not know, out of rascaldom you experiment here, you experiment here, you experiment here, you experiment.... There are so many holes. You go on experimenting, and waste your time. But unless you come to this point, that ""Food has to be supplied here,"" your all attempt will be failure. That you have to tell them. And because you cannot supersede nature's way. Nature's way is ""The food must go through here."" You cannot change it. You are not above nature."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,They say that you can become above nature.,Prabhupāda,That is foolishness. That will make them failure.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Oh, yes, they will fail.",Prabhupāda,"That will make them failure. Tell them, then this will make them failure. ""If you are so foolish that you want to go above nature, then you are fool number one.""Daivīhyeṣāguṇa-mayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14].It is not possible. That is not possible. Then you are following wrong path. If you are imagining like that, that ""We have surpassed the laws of nature,"" then you are fool number one."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:In that respect they are like the Americans and Russians. They think that we can overcome the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They are just like the Americans and Russians in the same way. They are thinking we can overcome the stringent laws of nature.,Prabhupāda,"No, that is the foolishness.Mūḍha.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥ[Bg.7.15].So long they will have this impression that they can overcome the laws of nature they will continue to becomemūḍha."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, another problem...",Prabhupāda,"In which way you have surpassed nature? First of all, if you are thinking like that, in which way you have surpassed the nature?"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:They say, ""For example, before we began our agricultural development, there was very poor agricultural produce all over the country due to lack of proper water. Now we have laid huge irrigation systems, and there is no more drought.""",Prabhupāda,"Therefore that is nature's way. Nature supplies you water. That is nature's way. That means you are making perfect according to the nature's way. But nature give you water; you produce profusely. But if you want to go above the nature, you produce without water."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:(laughs) It can't be done.,Prabhupāda,"Then we shall see that you have surpassed the laws of.... The laws of nature is there must be water. Nature is supplying. And you are trying to imitate. But if you say that ""We can overpass the nature's law,"" then you produce without water. Then you'll be able. Then we shall see that you have gone above.... This, you are following the nature's. That is not surpassed. That is following little properly. Now you have arranged for water. That's very good. But if nature pours water, then you save so much labor. Do you know that, how nature will supply water profusely? You haven't got to make artificial arrangement for water. Do you know that? Ask them. We know that."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Formerly their society was very much like the Vedic culture. There was the emperor and the...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, it was.... The Chinese people were coming, taking knowledge from.... Everyone was coming. So now argument that ""If you are.... You are following the nature's way. Nature supply water. That is a fact. Here is cloud. Nature will supply. Now, if you want to surpass nature, then you produce in the factory, without water, food grains. Then we shall understand that you can surpass. As you are producing instruments and so many other motorcars and this, that, so many, in the factory, that's all right. In the factory you produce food grains without water. Then you have surpassed nature."""
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They can't do that.,Prabhupāda,"Then where is the question of surpassing nature? Make them fool in every point, these rascals, by argument."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Unfortunately, they do not teach any philosophy anymore. They have done away with all...",Prabhupāda,This is not philosophy.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Yes. This is science.,Prabhupāda,"This philosophy, it is science. Without water you cannot produce. This is science. This is not imagination. So if you want to surpass nature, then you do practically. Why should you try to bring canal water or well water? Don't bring. You cannot surpass the laws of nature. That has to be accepted."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Their main point is that they want to manipulate expertly the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda,That means let them waste their time. Therefore it requires many births to understand this law.Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁprapadyate[Bg.7.19].
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:They're going away from this kind of understanding. They had a heritage of philosophical understanding, correct philosophical.... They were very.... For instance, their whole system during the time of Confucius.... Up until two or three hundred years ago their system was they had a monarchy, a king, an emperor, and the emperor was believed to be the representative of God.",Prabhupāda,That is good.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:And it was Vedic. They had abrāhmaṇacommunity. They called them scholars who were advising. And they had administrators, and they had workers. Now the current Communists, they are against that system. They say this system was the worst system of all because it made some big and some small. Because naturally it became...",Prabhupāda,"But you are doing the same thing. Otherwise why you are reforming? Who is reforming unless the one class is very intelligent? The same situation. You.... Your, what is that rascal's name?"
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Mao. Mao.,Prabhupāda,So he is supposed to be intelligent. He is supposed to be intelligent. So the two classes already there.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Well, he says everyone can be equally intelligent.",Prabhupāda,"That is another thing, but these classes must remain, the teacher class and the student class."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Here's what they do. They take the teachers.... This is one of their program. Actually we have written a report which explains. They take the teachers, and they send the teachers out into the factory and into the farms for years.",Prabhupāda,"So anywhere you send, the student and teacher class is there. You change the name, you change the process, it doesn't matter, but the student class and teacher class will always remain. That is your foolishness. You are simply changing different names. But originally, as planned by nature, that is always there."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,They say let the factory worker teach the teacher.,Prabhupāda,"Anyway, teacher class, rascal, it is teacher class. You make a teacher class."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They say everyone should be teachers.,Prabhupāda,"That ""should be"" means not."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:No, they are making everyone teachers.",Prabhupāda,"And this ""making"" means not."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,They are trying to make.,Prabhupāda,"That is all right. The classes, two classes, are there. You cannot change that. ""Trying,"" ""making,"" means two."
Hari,Hari-śauri:It's artificial.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Just like they let the students teach the teachers.,Prabhupāda,That's right. So the teachers.... Sometimes you become teacher; sometimes I become teacher. What is this?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They're trying to create a society where there are no superior-inferior.,Prabhupāda,That is not possible.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Classless society.,Prabhupāda,They are taking themselves the superior position to make it one.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:(laughs) Yes. That's a fact.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like some of the rascal swamis come here that ""There is no teacher of.... No require teacher, no need of books."""
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Then why do we needthem?,Prabhupāda,"And these rascals are writing books, that ""There is no need of book."""
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:That happened. One swami said, ""Now you.... Meditation means don't think of anything."" So then one of our men at the meeting raised his hand and said, ""Then why do we need you?"" So he got very angry. He said, ""If the mind should do nothing, what do we need you for?""",Prabhupāda,So what was his reply?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:He told his men to usher our man out. His men got very agitated because there was no reply. He couldn't give a reply, so they asked our man to leave for disturbing the sleeping of the public.",Prabhupāda,"Anyway, the whole world is rascal. They will manufacture and spoil time, their own time and others' time."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Prabhupāda, we did a report telling.... We wanted to read this to you. It gives you an idea of what are the possibilities of spreading your books orKṛṣṇaconsciousness in China. We made up a report for you. Do you want to hear it?",Prabhupāda,Hm.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Okay, you want to read it,Dhṛṣṭadyumna? 'Cause it is actually very useful, if not now, in the future, because this report is based on a lot of research. Read. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...that if they are rascals, then don't try. You see? Reject them. But there is good potency in your country. You do peacefully here. If they are rascals, means stubborn rascals..."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:You cannot imagine how rascal they are. That's why we wrote this report.,Prabhupāda,Then don't try. Don't waste time.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Balloons. That's how hard it is to preach there.,Prabhupāda,That is also nonsense.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:No, it's nonsense, but the point is how difficult it is. We have...",Prabhupāda,"Then don't try. Don't waste time. Don't try. Better try in your country. You have got enough field, and they are intelligent and they are favorable. So why should we waste our time? There is no need. If you make your country, America, God conscious,Kṛṣṇaconscious—they are already—that will be example to the whole world. These men, rascals' program, will be failure, finished, this, today or tomorrow. They'll never be successful. It is not.... That is not possible. If they have so foolishly declared that ""We are going above the laws of nature,"" they're first-class rascals. Which is impossible. What they have conquered over the nature? These rascals will not die?"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:No, they'll still die.",Prabhupāda,"Then? Then what is this? The rascals will not become old men? So what they have surpassed, laws of nature? What way? Simply making the teachers student and student teacher. Simply wasting time. Better you utilize your father's position, but for introducing our books to these high class men. Just you are trying to introduce books in the university libraries, similarly, you try to introduce these books to the high class. And that is not difficult. These men, they have got enough money. If they spend one thousand dollar for our books, that is nothing for them."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:One of your disciples,Praghoṣa, he's the biggest book distributor, practically. Tripurāri trained him up. He is now starting a program of meeting with these executives and doing just this. He is working in New York, and he's developing a program like this.",Prabhupāda,Now in India also they are trying. Yaśomatī.... Yaśodānandana's report is that he approached one head librarian inAndhraPradesh and...
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Karnataka.,Prabhupāda,"Karnataka. Karnataka province, educated province, Karnataka, South India, Karnataka, very educated. So he has immediately ordered thirty sets of books in different libraries. He has appreciated so much."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:The professors in Bombay, some of them are already reviewing Prabhupāda's books very favorably.",Prabhupāda,"So you just touch the topmost men. But if, somehow or other, if you see some of the topmost men of the China, ""You kindly read our books at your leisure."""
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:You can't approach those men.,Prabhupāda,"Then give it up. If it is too difficult, don't waste time."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:It's not only difficult, it's impossible.",Prabhupāda,Then don't waste time.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Completely impossible.,Prabhupāda,Give up this idea.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:It may be possible fifty years from now.,Prabhupāda,That's all right. Our descendants will try for that. But let us try where it is favorable. Don't waste time.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:We were really, you know, just looking for any loophole, but there is no loophole.",Prabhupāda,No hole. That's all right. We don't care for it.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:The man we spoke to, when he heard what we wanted to do, he said, ""Boys, you're up against the wall."" He said, ""You're up against the Great Wall."" China has a wall called the Great Wall. He said, ""You've come up against the Great Wall. You'll never cross it.""",Prabhupāda,"No, they'll be.... Nature's law is so strong that they are also trying to knock their head in the wall. They will themselves break their head. The laws of nature is the same. If you try to break the walls from this side and if they try to break the walls from that side, both of them will lose their head. So if they are so foolish.... They are foolish. Everywhere such foolish men are there. They are trying to overcome the laws of nature. That is the greatest foolishness. That is the greatest foolishness. Just like government has got police force, military force, and if somebody tries to become, violate the laws of government by defying police force and military force—that is futile. Is it possible, that ""I shall defy the government laws""? No, there is police force. There is military. ""I don't care for that."" It is foolishness. It is simply foolishness. Similarly, these laws of nature means the force of the Supreme. So if you want to defy, you may waste your time. It is not possible. And practically,Kṛṣṇasays, ""Here I have enforced this miserable condition of material life.""Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānu[Bg.13.9].First of all surpass this,janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.Then talk of surpassing the laws of nature. Can the Communists overcome, stopping old age? No Communist will be old man? Then what way you have surpassed the laws of nature? No Communist will die? Then where is your surpassing laws of nature? Ultimately you are under the grip of laws of nature. So what is the meaning of this foolish talking, that ""I am going to surpass the laws of nature""? Show us first of all."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Their goal is not so broad. They just want to control the...,Prabhupāda,"That means the little children's policy. Children, just like imagining so many things, ""I shall do that. I shall do."" The potter's imagination. You know that? Potter's imagination? You do not know the story? One potter is selling earthen pots, and he is saying that ""Now, these twopaisā,it has cost me onepaisā.I shall make onepaisāprofit. Then I can make such profit. I shall invest again. I shall make another profit, another profit. In this way I shall become millionaire. Then I shall marry, and my wife shall be very obedient. And if (s)he does not become obedient, I shall give him a kick like this."" And he, what was.... One pot was there. He kicked that pot and broke. (laughter) It broke. ""Oh, again I am poor man."" So this is going on, imagination. Imagination.... ""I shall become so great that I shall kick Kṛṣṇa's law,"" and whatever pot he had-broken. That's all. Rascals, simply rascals. If anyone thinks like that, that ""I shall surpass the laws of nature,"" then he's madman. He's madman. So what is the use of dealing with madmen? And as soon as you challenge them that ""Show us that you have surpassed the laws of nature,"" ""Yes, we are trying. In future we shall do."" That's all. This is their reply. So it is better to avoid such men. But if you peacefully you can introduce, ""All right, you will do. You are wonderful men, so kindly if you read some pages of this, it is not very costly. You can keep. At leisure hour you can read,"" in this way, imploring, then they will be benefited. That much we can do to any rascal.Hesādhavaḥsakalamevavihāyadūrātcaitanya-candra-caraṇe:""Oh, you are so nice. Therefore I am flattering you. I humbly obeisance. Kindly hear one thing. Keep some books. It is not very costly.""Bas.This much you can do. And let them become puffed up by their false notions. But if they keep some books, sometimes they will read or their sons will read. That's all. Therefore I am stressing so much on books, that if the puffed-up rascals take some book and sometimes, if they read, he'll be benefited, perfectly benefited. So distribute these books anywhere possible. It doesn't matter where it is. The same process.Dantenidhāyatṛṇakaṁ padayornipatya.The books will sell, that ""You rascal number one, you set aside whatever learned.

But for the benefit of the rascal child sometimes he has to say like that. That ""If you take the medicine I'll give you cake.""

Our purpose is why we are pushing so much this sales of books. Because our missionary activities will be very widely known. That we want. Somehow or other let him purchase a book. That is our mission. There is no question of transgressing moral principles. <a href=""/d/arjuna"" class=""d"">Arjuna</a>. <a href=""/d/arjuna"" class=""d"">Arjuna</a> was arguing with <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> that this killing of my relatives, it is horrible, abominable.
