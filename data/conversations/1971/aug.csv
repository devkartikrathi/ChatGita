Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:Yes, Your Grace, it seems to many people that there is probably more. There are probably more people in the world now who are seeking some kind of spiritual new light than probably ever before, or at least, there's more evidence of it. And I wonder if you agreed with that, and if so can you tell me why it is?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, That should be the natural hankering with us. Because we are spirit soul we cannot be happy in material atmosphere. Just like you take out the fish from the water, it cannot be happy on the land, similarly, if we are without spiritual consciousness we can never be happy. So people after advancement of scientific knowledge and economic development, they are not happy. They are becoming hippies. So the cause is that they're in search of spiritual life and this is the proper delivery,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, or God consciousness."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:Thank you. So presumably you would encourage this movement of more people to find a spiritual life. You...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, unless you take to this movement, you cannot be happy. That's a fact. Therefore we invite everyone to study, to understand this great movement."
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:What worries me slightly is that since the arrival in Britain some while ago of the Maharishi MaheshYogi, a lot of... He was the firstguruthat most people ever heard of, and since then there have been a lot of people and a lot of gurus that have suddenly appeared out of nowhere. And one gets the feeling that sometimes they're not all as genuine as they ought to be, and I wondered whether you feel that it's right that you could perhaps issue a warning to people who are seeking some new spiritual life that they should take care to make sure they have a genuineguruto teach them.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:Do you feel there's a danger?,Prabhupāda,"Of course, to search outguruis very nice. But if you want a cheapguruor if you want to be cheated, then there will be many cheater gurus. But if you are sincere, then you'll have sincereguru. People want to be cheated because they want everything very cheap. But just like we are asking people no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxication. So people think it is very difficult, it is botheration. And if somebody says, ""No, you do. Whatever nonsense you like do. You simply take mymantra,"" they will like it. So the thing is that they want to be cheated; therefore cheaters come. They don't want to undergo some austerity. Human life is meant for austerity. But they are not prepared to undergo austerity. Suppose some cheaters come. They say, ""Oh, no austerity. Whatever you like you do. You simply pay me and I'll give you some particularmantra,and you become God within six months."" (Laughter) And that is going on. So you want to be, if people want to be cheated like that, the cheaters will come."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:So do you think people should beware?,Prabhupāda,They should be serious.
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:I mean if someone in all seriousness wishes to find the spiritual life and happens to finish up with the wrongguru, I mean should they beware?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. But... When ordinary education, to take ordinary education one has to devote so much time, labor, and understand, and if one is going to take spiritual life they must be serious. And how is that, they think that simply by some wonderfulmantrawithin six months they become God? Why they want like that? That is... That means they want to be cheated."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:And how would one tell that one had a genuinegurubecause one would be told to give up certain parts of...?,Prabhupāda,"That of course depends on the person who is really anxious forguru. Just like when you go to the market to purchase some thing, you test it whether it is genuine or not. Similarly, you have to test who is genuine."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:How can you tell if you don't...?,Prabhupāda,"That requires little education, a little knowledge. Therefore we are opening so many centers, giving people opportunity to know what is genuine, what is not genuine."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:How many followers have you got now throughout the world or can you not count...?,Prabhupāda,"Well, for any genuine thing the followers may be very little, and any rubbish thing, the followers may be many."
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:How many... I meant for the initiated followers, people who have...",Prabhupāda,About three thousand we have got.
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:And is it growing all the time?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is growing very slowly. Because we have got so many restrictions. People do not like any restriction."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:Yes. Where is the following the greatest? It is in America?,Prabhupāda,"In America, in Europe, and Canada, inJapan, Australia. And India there is millions, there is millions of this cult. Apart from India, in other countries they are small quantity. But in India there are millions and millions."
Male Interviewer:,Male Interviewer:Do you think your movement is the only way to come to know God?,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Devotee:,Devotee:Do you think this movement is the only way to know God?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Male Interviewer:,Male Interviewer:So how do you have that assurance?,Prabhupāda,"From the authorities, from God,Kṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66]."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:It's not that we don't accept other religious processes.,Prabhupāda,"No, we believe other process. Just like there are steps. If you want to go to the topmost story, so you go by steps. So some of them have gone fifty steps, some of them have gone hundred steps, but to complete the required steps is 1,000 steps."
Male Interviewer:,Male Interviewer:And you've gone up the thousand have you?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:If any of us here this morning wish to become followers what would we have to give or give up?,Prabhupāda,First of all one has to give up illicit sex life.
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:Does that include all sex life or...?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:What is illicit?,Prabhupāda,"Illicit sex (is) without marriage, without any relation, sex life, that is illicit sex life."
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:So sex is allowed in marriage, but not outside.",Prabhupāda,"That is animal sex life. Just as animals, they have no relationship and have sex life. But human society there is restriction. In every country, in every religion there is a system of marriage. So without marriage, sex life is illicit sex life."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:But sex is allowed within marriage.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is..."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:And what else would one have to give up for...,Prabhupāda,One has to give up all kinds of intoxicants.
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:Is that drugs and spirits?,Prabhupāda,Any kind of drug that intoxicates.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Even tea and...,Prabhupāda,"Even tea, cigarette. They are also intoxicants."
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:So that includes alcohol, marijuana, tea. Anything else?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. One has to give up animal food. All kinds of animal food. Meat, eggs, fish, like that. And one has to give up gambling."
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:Does one have to leave one's family? I think everybody lives in the temple, don't they?",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Unless one gives up all these sinful activities one cannot be initiated."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:So one should give up one's family as well?,Prabhupāda,Family?
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:To be a for..., yes.",Prabhupāda,"Of course, family. We are not concerned with the family, we are concerned with the individual person. If one wants to be initiated in thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement he has to give up all these sinful activities."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:No.,Prabhupāda,Not necessarily.
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:Oh, I could stay at home?",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:What about work, though? Does one have to give up one's job?",Prabhupāda,"You have to give up these bad habits and chant these beads,HareKṛṣṇamantra.That's all."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:Would I have to give any financial support?,Prabhupāda,"No, that's your voluntary wish. If you give us, that's all right. Otherwise, we don't mind."
Woman Interviewer:,"Woman Interviewer:Sorry, I didn't understand.",Prabhupāda,"We do not want, depend on anyone's financial contributions. We depend on God, orKṛṣṇa."
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:So I wouldn't have to give any money at all.,Prabhupāda,No.
Woman Interviewer:,Woman Interviewer:Is this one of the main things that distinguishes a genuinegurufrom a fakeguru?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. A genuineguruis not a business man. Our... (end) Therefore His teachings, crude, teachings, cannot be now applied to the modern advanced educated people. That was suitable for those people. Now people have advanced in science, in philosophy. Now God consciousness ...and should be presented on the basis of science and philosophy. Otherwise people will not accept."
Guest:,"Guest:There's one philosophical point I would like you to elucidate. I haven't been able to quite understand, certainly the dualistic, incomprehensible... the dualistic-nondualistic philosophy which sees at the same timeKṛṣṇa, as comprehending all of man, all of the world, everything, within the body, we might say, ofKṛṣṇa, And at the same time however, one sees the world as distinct fromKṛṣṇa, in other words, asmāyā,and as illusion. And it is this, the dualistic, I would like to... If you could just explain to me the difference between the... I mean, how this fits in, the monistic or the idea of the unitary view thatKṛṣṇais everything, all and in all. And then at the same time that the world, there is this world of illusion which is somehow distinct fromKṛṣṇa. Could you just explain this point to me?",Prabhupāda,"This is very easy to understand. Just like you are recording my speeches in the tape recorder. When you play back it will speak just like I am speaking, but I am not there. Is it not fact?"
Guest:,Guest:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"It will appear now I am speaking from beyond this world. Somebody's hearing, here somebody's speaking. Again, when the record player will play... (end)"
Guest (1) English lady:,Guest (1) English lady:I've seen a few about the street.,Prabhupāda,Where?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):We live down there, you see, and we've seen them several times in the street singing, and asked them what you're doing, really.",Prabhupāda,You can keep it here. It may fall down. No. So do you know something about our movement?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I've been told something about it, the other day.",Prabhupāda,"We are preaching God consciousness. God is God. God is neither Christian, norHindu, nor Muslim. God is God. So everyone should be God conscious. That is our movement. We are preaching love of Godhead. So it doesn't matter what type of religion one is following. We simply want to see that he has love for God. Ourbhāgavata-dharmadefines: that is first-class religion following which one becomes a lover of God.Savaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo yato bhaktiradhokṣaje[SB1.2.6].That is first-class religion if by following that one becomes a lover of God. It doesn't matter what religion he is following, but the test will be whether he has become a lover of God. That is our..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):So you don't try to convert people from other religions.,Prabhupāda,No.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):One can be Christian and...,Prabhupāda,Anyway. We are teaching how to love God. That's all.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Yes. So we're doing the same thing.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. But the test is there, whether he has become a lover of God or lover of dog. That is the test. If you find that he has become a lover of dog, then his religion is useless."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):How does he know?,Prabhupāda,"You can see whether he's loving God or dog. That's all. That you can see. Everyone can see, whether he has got good love for dog or good love for God. That you can see. Anyone can see. The test is there. Crucial test is there."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Jesus used the expression loving God or loving mammon.,Prabhupāda,"That says, or... Everyone says different way. Mammon or dog is expression in the faith. That is the test.CaitanyaMahāprabhusays:"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):We say Jesus Christ.,Prabhupāda,"But Jesus Christ never said that He is God. He said ""Son of God."" We have no objection to chant the name, holy name of Jesus Christ. We have no objection. But we are preaching that ""Chant the holy name of God."" If you haven't got any name of God, then you chant our conception of name of God,Kṛṣṇa. We don't sayKṛṣṇa."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):We see that.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So what you want more? Therefore let us cooperate. Don't think that it is against Christianism or it is sectarian. Let us cooperate fully. Jointly, let us preach all over the world, ""Chant the holy name of God."" Let us join together. That should be the real purpose of devotees of God. Here is... They are preaching love of God. Why should we be envious about them? It doesn't matter. We don't say that you chantHareKṛṣṇa. If you have got name of God, you chant it. That's all. But we are preaching this cult, that chant the holy name of God. That's all. So what objection there may be from other sects? But they are envious. Because the younger generation are taking to it, so they are envious. Why they are envious? We wanted to purchase one church, and the priest in charge said that ""I shall better burn this church. I shall not give them."" Just see. Why? What we have done wrong? This is the very statement. ""Better I shall burn this church, but I won't give them."" Then? What we have done?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Don't worry about that.,Prabhupāda,"No, I don't worry. That is another thing. But there are so many vacant churches. They are forsale. But as soon as we go, they refuse. ""No."""
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):When you chant, do you have to think what you're saying? How can you do other things?",Prabhupāda,Other things?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, many things require your concentration.",Prabhupāda,"Well, let us first of all chant the holy name. Then we shall think of concentration."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):You see, two, two things... You can't...",Prabhupāda,"No. Concentrate, concentration automatically. If I chantHareKṛṣṇaand I hear, that is concentration. That is concentration. Immediately."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But you can't read or talk to someone.,Prabhupāda,"There is no question of reading. We are simply asking to chant. Reading will come later on. Just like a small child, he's taught... In our educational system they chant... What is that? That...? (Hindi)Pahara pahara.(?)"
Indian man:,Indian man:Pahara.Alphabet. A.I.E.,Prabhupāda,"They chant. By chanting, by hearing they learn. ""A,B,C,"" like that. ""2 plus 2 equal to 4."" We did it in our childhood. One boy will chant like that. ""2 plus 2 equal to 4."" And we shall repeat. ""2 plus 2 equal to 4."" So repeating three times, I understand 2 plus 2 equal to 4."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Do you find that the chant goes on in your heart?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Do you find that the chant goes on in your heart?,Prabhupāda,Why not? Why not?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):It goes deeper and deeper?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Everything we hear, it goes to the heart. If I call you by name, it does not go to my heart? ""You rascal. You stupid."" You hear. Does it not go to my heart? Why I become angry unless it goes to my heart. If ""rascal,"" ""stupid,"" and all these bad names go to my heart, why God's name will not go to my heart? If by calling you by ill names you become angry, that means it goes to your heart. Why not good name? It goes. It enters through the ear and goes to the heart."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I'm doing that, saying sometimes a little prayer...",Prabhupāda,"So if you repeatedly chant, it will remain. It will always remain in your heart."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Always going on.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. There is no chance of escape. Chant constantly,HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare,HareRāmaHareRāmaRāmaRāmaHareHare. It remains in the heart. Not only my heart. Others' heart, they also joke, ""HareKṛṣṇa!"" If it can remain in others' heart, why not my heart? Those who are joking me, imitating me. We... Last time, when I was going in Africa, I stopped for few minutes in Athens. Some of the younger residents chant, ""HareKṛṣṇa!"" You see? As soon as they saw us, they began to chantHareKṛṣṇa. They could understand, ""These areHareKṛṣṇapeople."" Yes. So by their dress, by theirtilaka,they oblige others to chantHareKṛṣṇa, either for imitating or for joking. So they gain. But ifHareKṛṣṇachanting has got any effect, even by joking like that, he'll get gain. If it is actually spiritual, by simply joking he will get gain."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:In Manchester across the street from the temple there's a big park. Sometimes I would go over there to walk and chant rounds, and there's many little children in the park. They'd follow me, ""HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa!"" All day. Hundred times.",Prabhupāda,"Everywhere. Everywhere. In Bombay, everywhere we go, ""HareKṛṣṇa."" In Montreal. They joke, they'll clap, but they'll chant. And that is wanted. I want to see that everyone is chanting. And if chanting has effect, then either he's chanting jokingly or seriously it will have the effect. Fire, if you touch either jokingly or seriously or cautiously, it will act. So our request is that you also preach this cult. Let us cooperate. The whole world is suffering for want of God consciousness. So it is the duty of all religious sects to teach this simple art of chantingHareKṛṣṇaor any other name which you have got. That's all."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):We do it in some, together, in the orthodox church. And we take turns doing two hundred.",Prabhupāda,That's nice.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):And... These are for counting.,Prabhupāda,That is nice. We also do the same thing. We chantHareKṛṣṇa.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):""Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us.""",Prabhupāda,"Oh, what is the wording?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):""Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us.""",Prabhupāda,"""Lord Jesus Christ, son of God..."""
Guest (1):,Guest (1):It's a little prayer.,Prabhupāda,That's nice.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):And they also pray to the mother of God.,Prabhupāda,"Sinful? ""We are sinful?"" You say, ""sinful"" something? ""Forgive some sins"" or something like?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):And you say it in your own language.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. ""Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God, have mercy on us."" That's nice. Very good."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"That is nice. Now, the, by praying, it is expected that one should have mercy of God. So what is the test that he has got the mercy of God?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):The mercy of God is the love of God, isn't it?",Prabhupāda,"That's it. Mercy of... So... That is the test, that he has learned how to love God.Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāyate[Cc.Madhya19.53].CaitanyaMahāprabhuis also worshiped, that ""You can give love of God.""Kṛṣṇaprema-pradāyate.Namomahā-vadānyāya.""You are the most munificent of all incarnations because You are distributing love of God.""Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāyate[Cc.Madhya19.53].Kṛṣṇāyakṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne.""You areKṛṣṇain the form of devotee ofKṛṣṇa. So I offer my respects."" This isRūpaGosvāmī's prayer."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Do you find that you chant, it clarifies you?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, certainly. God and God's name, and God or God's son, they are nondifferent. So either I be in touch with God's son or God's name, I am in touch with God. But they are nondifferent."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What happens to your mind? What do you do with your mind when you chant?,Prabhupāda,"Whatever it may be in my mind, it doesn't matter. My mind may be different."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:What should the mind be doing?,Prabhupāda,"My mind should be absorbed in God consciousness. That is, that is the effect. He can think of God only, nothing else. That is the effect."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):It's very difficult to think of God.,Prabhupāda,"No. It is not difficult. It is difficult for the sinners. Those who are not sinners, it is not difficult. Because in theBhagavad-gītāit is said:"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):There's a lot more ...sins than just those four things.,Prabhupāda,Yes. These are the four principles of sinful activities.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):If you're irritated with somebody.,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:She says if you're irritated with somebody, this is also a sin.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Your mind can be filled with this kind of sin.,Prabhupāda,"Irritated... If your mind is in peace... If you are not indulging in intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, then your mind will not be irritated. How a gambler can be in peaceful mind? That is not possible. How a drunkard can be in peaceful mind? Agitation is for them who are simply engaged in sinful life. Those who are not engaged in sinful life, naturally they are peaceful. Their mind is not agitated. Vegetarians are naturally peaceful. Just see between a dog and a cow. (laughter). Dog unnecessarily will talk: ""Gow! Gow! Gow! Gow!"" (makes barking sound) without any fault. ""Why you are here? Why you are here? Why you are here?"" That is dog's qualification. A cow, so useful animal, it will never agitate. The dog has no use, but still he's the best friend. (laughter) And cow, actually giving us milk, sending to the slaughterhouse. Just see. This is human civilization. A dog is worshiped, and a cow is slaughtered. Do you think it is civilization? Do you think? Can you support this?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, I had a friend who was a vegetarian...",Prabhupāda,"No, apart from this, these two animals. One is dog, and another is cow. So dog is worshiped and cow is sent to the slaughterhouse. What kind of civilization it is?Huh?"
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Animal.,Prabhupāda,"Less than! Cow is supporting the whole society with milk. Every morning, without milk, we cannot live. The child, without milk, cannot live. She should be treated as mother. And they are being sent to the slaughterhouse. And still, they are thinking of becoming free from sinful life. Can anyone kill his own mother? ""Oh, mother is old and useless. Let her be killed. Burden."" Is that very gratitude for the mother by the son?"
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:They do that. As soon as the cow is too old to give milk, immediately slaughterhouse. I was talking to one man, he was a cowherdsman here in England. He said he couldn't stand it. He said a nice cow, she would get old, she couldn't give milk anymore, immediately slaughterhouse. Just like that. The most disgusting thing.",Prabhupāda,"(people coming in) Oh. You come forward. Give him seat. Śivānanda, you come... You can sit there. Yes. So the God consciousness can be awakened if you stop sinful activities. Otherwise, it is impossible. You go on preaching for millions of years; there will be no God consciousness. There will be no God consciousness. That is the... inBhagavad-gītā.(people sitting down) Why? You can come here, this side."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:You can sit here.,Prabhupāda,"Yeṣāṁtvanta-gataṁpāpaṁ[Bg.7.28].One who has finished sinful activities, he can be engaged in God consciousness. One who is engaged in sinful activities, he cannot. Devil citing scripture. A devīl cannotcitescripture. Angel cancitescripture. And according to ourācāryas,SanātanaGosvāmī, he says that ""Don't hear scriptures from the devīl.""Avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁpūtaṁhari-kathāmṛtaṁśravaṇaṁnaivakartavyam."" If a devīl's preaching about God, don't hear."" If you say, ""God is pure, so let me hear about God. It doesn't matter whether he is devīl or angel. It doesn't matter."" No. The argument issarpocchiṣṭaṁ payoyathā.Just like milk is very nourishing food, but if it is touched by the lips, by the tongue of a serpent, it becomes poison.Sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payoyathā.You cannot bring the milk which is touched by the serpent's tongue. So we should receive knowledge of God, message of God, from a person who is not a devīl. Then it will be effective. Otherwise, it will act as poison.CaitanyaMahāprabhu's principle isāpaniācariprabhujīveriśikṣāya.He first of all behaves himself, and then he preaches. So if the preacher is sinful, how he can deliver other sinful men by his so-called preaching. That is not possible. He must be pure, he must be sinless. Then his preaching will be effective. But in all conditions, if we, with faith and love we chant the holy name of God, we shall become gradually purified. There is no, I mean to say, cause of anxiety. Anyone who will chant this holy name, he'll be purified."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:That line,jayasakal vipod bhaktivinod bolen jakhon o nām gāy.",Prabhupāda,"O nām gāy,yes."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:All obstacles will go away if you chant the holy name.,Prabhupāda,"According toBhagavad-gītā,there are four classes of men who deride at God and four classes of men who approaches God."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):People find it very difficult today...,Prabhupāda,"It is not difficult. It is just like this, I gave you this example. Three years or two years before it was difficult. And it is not difficult. It has to be trained."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:People outside, she says, they find it difficult even to believe in God now.",Prabhupāda,"No, therefore propaganda is required. They are rascal fools, but we are not rascal and fools. We must preach."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, you can't preach until you are purified.",Prabhupāda,"Eh? No, purification will go on. Suppose you are... Just like we are holding, what I... I began this propaganda in the Western countries. I was sitting in a park, Thompkinson's? What is that?"
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Thompkins Square.,Prabhupāda,"Thompkins Square in New York. I was simply chantingHareKṛṣṇa, and they used to gather. And gradually, they became my disciples, students. So I began in this way, chantingHareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHare... For three hours, from two to five. That's all. And they are still doing that. They are going on the street. ThisHareKṛṣṇa, the same thing, is going on. They are being arrested sometimes. They are being harassed. But still, they don't give up. They chant. This boy in Germany, I sent in Germany. Hesatdown on the footpath and chantingHareKṛṣṇa. This boy. Practically, he started my European movement, he started first."
Guest (2) Gentlemen:,Guest (2) Gentlemen:Have you been harassed in London at all?,Prabhupāda,"I don't think, but they are Londoners. They know better than me."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes. Which is the worse and which is the better?,Prabhupāda,"America is more tolerant, I think."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Well, we fought this out in the court here and the magistrate allowed that we can chant. There is no law who can stop chanting. But the police, authorities, they say, well, ""You are obstructing the traffic."" And under that we are arrested.",Prabhupāda,They can find out anything.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:So they still have some respect for people who are trying to glorify God.,Prabhupāda,"In American in every court case, we win. (laughter)"
Devotee:,"Devotee:Last, year, when we went to the police authorities for our procession here, and we wanted to make threerathasand the police officer, he was so envious, he said, ""No. There is no law, we can put threerathason the street."" We said, ""What is the harm? Won't you give us protection?"" ""So many people will be dying and killed under theratha.If therathais so big and all that. People will be killed."" I said, ""They are big all over the world. This is for God consciousness.""",Prabhupāda,"So many people are dying by motor accidents, but do they stop motor car?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Can I ask about your rate... about growth? How, can ask how the movement is growing? Can you give me any figures at all? I was speaking to one of your colleagues earlier who mentioned 150, but seventy-five approximately which were in London. Are the figures growing week by week?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. I started this movement alone, and now there are eight thousand."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):And what is the figure likely to be? Five a week, ten a week?",Prabhupāda,"We don't keep any statistics, but actually the fact is that I started alone; now we are eight thousand."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, five years ago.",Prabhupāda,In 1966.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:In 1966.,Prabhupāda,"No, England we started in 1968."
Devotee:,"Devotee:That 150 is those who have fully dedicated their life, but there are thousands who are followers and admirers who have not joined here.",Prabhupāda,They are admirers.
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Everyone is a member of this movement. But some people have forgotten. Our movement is to remind them. Every living being is by nature a servant of God. Now people are forgetting. We want them to remember. We don't care for some difference of technique in worship. We want people to take up the business of chanting the names of God.,Prabhupāda,"Just as in the same family some of the sons have forgotten father and some of them remember, but both of them member of the same family. Because he has forgotten his father does not mean that he is not son. He still remains. So actually, everyone is a member of God's family. That is our vision. Not only human being, but animals also. We therefore consider animals also brothers. We don't support animal killing."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):(indistinct) in your four principles.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Yes. And we can eat it after it's been offered to the Lord with love and devotion. This we callprasādamor Kṛṣṇa's mercy.,Prabhupāda,"Actually, any foodstuff is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Any foodstuff is Kṛṣṇa's, God's mercy. Just like grain. You cannot manufacture grain. It is by God's mercy you get it."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Can I ask...,Prabhupāda,"This is very important point, that we are not negating pleasure, but we are trying to bring them to the highest pleasure."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):When you come into this movement, you come in from on the outside, in the material world and so on. Do you, as some monks do in monasteries, do you give all your wealth, all your possessions, everything, as it were, to the movement?",Prabhupāda,Not necessarily. Why?
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:Not necessarily. But generally yes. Because we're coming here to serveKṛṣṇaand we understand that everything is Kṛṣṇa's. So whatever we come with is automatically Kṛṣṇa's, so we use it in His service.",Prabhupāda,"Actually, we don't possess anything. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's. What we possess, so-called possession, that is illegal. Because I cannot possess your property. I can possess your property by stealing. Not by fair dealings."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):I can possess it if you give it to me.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is nice. So that is our philosophy.Tenatyaktenabhuñjīthā[Īśomantra1].Whatever God has given you, you possess. Don't try to possess other's property.Māgṛdhaḥkasyasviddhanam.Everything belongs to God, so whatever God gives me, you enjoy it. I take it. I don't encroach upon other's property."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):You use your own, responsibly.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. I should feel grateful. ""Oh, God has given me this thing, so whatever utility is there, first of all I must offer to God."" God has given me this grain to eat, so I must cook and first of all offer to God, and then I shall eat."" This is feeling gratitude, grateful."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Would you use, say, cars if it were given you?",Prabhupāda,What is that?
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Things like that.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, why not?"
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Just like this tape recorder.,Prabhupāda,"Because originally, everything is possession of God."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):If you had a big house, a rich house. You would use that?",Prabhupāda,Yes. We shall turn into temple.
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Immediately.,Prabhupāda,"Immediately. (laughter) We are searching after. If you can give, it will be very much..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):To put beautiful things in it?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Wherever we shall go, we cannot go without God. So if we get a palatial house, immediately make a very gorgeous, nice temple, and chantHareKṛṣṇaand dance. That's all. We can utilize anything. Because everything is belonging to God. So as soon as we get something, we utilize it for God. That is our philosophy."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Who controls, if one of the members becomes grasping, wants things for himself...?",Prabhupāda,"No, what... We are therefore teaching. We are therefore teaching. Members are gradually learning how to sacrifice for God. So when he is completely trained up, he knows that nothing belongs to Him. Everything belongs to God. Therefore, whatever he possesses, it must be utilized for God's purposes. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness, or God consciousness. We take it for granted, and that is a fact. Everything belongs to God. God, whatever God has given me for my use, so I must use it, first of all expressing my gratitude to God, ""O God, You are so kind that You have given me this. So first of all you taste it. Then I'll eat."" This is our philosophy."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What about pleasures like listening to music?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, we chant the glories of God."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Could you listen to other peoples' music?,Prabhupāda,"Huh? No. If he's chanting the glories of God, we are very eager to hear him. That is our process. Or somebody's chanting, somebody's hearing.Śravaṇaṁkīrtanaṁviṣṇu.Chanting and hearing about God, that is music."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, a Beethoven symphony, for example, could you listen to that?",Prabhupāda,Which one?
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Beethoven's symphony. He means classical Western music. They make some music.,Prabhupāda,"But if it is glorification of God, we can hear. There is no objection."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:But there may be no reference to God in it.,Prabhupāda,"No, then we don't hear. We reject."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Inspired by God, given by God.",Prabhupāda,"Given by God is everything. That is another thing. Just like everything is government property. But do you like to go to the prisonhouse? We say everything belongs to government. We are not so liberal, that ""Because everything belongs to government, therefore I shall go to the prisonhouse."""
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I take everything is good because it belongs to God, but you do choose, in fact, or you wouldn't choose to waste your time when you should be doing something else.",Prabhupāda,"But for God's cause we can go. Just like these boys are sometimes arrested and put into jail. That is God's cause. But they are not prepared to go to the jail by pickpocketing. That is not their mission. They are executing God's business and if somebody puts him into jail, ""All right. It is God's desire. That's all."""
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:The point is that there must be direct connection with God. If God's name is there, if God's service is there, if God's form is there, then we are interested.",Prabhupāda,Nirbandhekṛṣṇasambandhe.Everything must be related with God.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, if you're relaxing, if you need to relax, and you sit and listen to some music, it doesn't say praise God all the time, but in fact is, because it's beautiful.",Prabhupāda,"No, we don't accept anything beautiful without God. Without God, everything is ugly to us. Everything ugly."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):So you have to bless it by offering it to God first.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is another thing."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:Originally, music and art were employed only to glorify the Lord in the scripture and...",Prabhupāda,"InSāma-veda,Sāma-veda."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:Yes. And limited and temporary. It's calledcapalasukha,flickering.",Prabhupāda,"Now, even there was no God's picture, one who is God conscious, he can see in the natural scenery presentation, he can see, ""Oh, how God is artistic. How he has manufactured this flower, how he has painted, how He has made this tree."" So that is higher intelligence. That is higher intelligence. Because without God, there can be nothing existing. So one has to learn how to see God in everything. That is another thing. That is higher status. Yes. But in the lower status of God consciousness one is advised that you should not see anything without God. But in the higher status, there is nothing in the world which is without God. But we should not imitate the higher status of life in the lower status of our position. Otherwise, one who has learned about God, he can see God in this flower. Actually, how God's hand has worked out this nice flower. Just like in theBhagavad-gītāGod says,raso 'hamapsukaunteya[Bg.7.8].Just like I am drinking water. In the taste of the water I'll see God. God says,Kṛṣṇasays, ""I am the taste of the water."" And actually, that taste cannot be created by man. The taste in the water, that is God's gift. So as soon as I taste the water, immediately I should remember, ""Oh, here is God."""
Guest (1):,Guest (1):So we believe that the holy spirit empowers artists and composers. And therefore we would say that a symphony was a creation of God.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Creation... In everything there is hand of God. Therefore one who has learned to see everything in connection with God, he sees God everywhere, every moment. (knock) Yes?Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanenasantaḥsadaivahṛdayeṣuvilokayanti. Premāñjana cchurita[Bs.5.38].When one has developed love of God, he sees God everywhere, always. Because everything is creation of God; so he can find out, ""Here is my Lord. Here is my Lord. Here is my Lord."" That is the highest state of loving God. He cannot see anything without connection of God."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):It's a matter of attitude who created this (indistinct),Prabhupāda,Hm?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):It's a matter of your attitude.,Prabhupāda,"Not attitude. Development of my God consciousness. Attitude may be artificial. But it is actual development of God consciousness. God consciousness is there in everybody. It requires simply to be developed. Just like a child. A child has got love within her, within his heart. But when he is young, it develops. It develops. And the girl, boy, automatically becomes attached because that propensity has developed. It is not an artificial thing. It was already there. It has to be developed. So God consciousness is there in everyone's heart. Otherwise, how these boys are chantingHareKṛṣṇa? UnlessKṛṣṇawas there within. Artificially you cannot force them, chantHareKṛṣṇatwenty-four hours."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Do you believe you (indistinct) people, if they hear it? If they hear this?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. As they hear, they became purified, and that dormant consciousness becomes awakened. Yes. Awakened. That chance we are giving. We are chanting and others are hearing. By this process, chanting and hearing, both of us will be benefited, awakening our original God consciousness."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:At the stage of awakening, when you're waking up, when you're becoming cured of the diseased condition, you sometimes have to restrict your diet. Later on, when you are healthy, you can take all kinds of foodstuffs in the proper way. But while you're getting over a disease you have to restrict your diet. Therefore we hear things that are directly concerned with Kṛṣṇa's name, form, activities. Later on, then we'll be able to see God in a flower, God in everywhere. Otherwise we'll see the flower however we enjoy a flower because we're not at that healthy stage. So therefore there are regulations that we follow for curing the disease. That means for a little while we restrict the diet. Then when we're healthy...",Prabhupāda,"Just like these flowers. These flowers the devotees are bringing to their spiritual master, to God. They are not enjoying. Ordinary man, if he gets a flower, he'll put it in the pocket. How... You see? That is the difference of God consciousness. The flower is the same, but use is different."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:Do you follow the question, Śrīla Prabhupāda? His question is do we concern ourselves with particular problems in the world, there's the war in Vietnam, there's racial discrimination? Do we make statements to condemn this war or to condemn that discrimination?",Prabhupāda,"No. Thing is that there are so many problems. Our proposition is, when you become God conscious, then all problems automatically solved. We don't take the problems. We take the... Just like disease. There are many symptoms. A man is suffering from a particular disease. He has a headache, he has this pain, this pain, that pain."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):They're only symptoms.,Prabhupāda,These are all different symptoms of the society's being materially diseased.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):So the answer is you do not comment on it?,Prabhupāda,"Harāvabhaktasyakuto mahādguṇā[SB5.18.12].If one is Godless, he cannot have any good qualities."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:There's a saying, ""charity begins at home."" (end)",Prabhupāda,"Simply we shall sell retail in oursaṅkīrtana.Let them sell to the bookstore. We shall not sell a single copy to the bookstore, or wholesaler. We shall simply sell in oursaṅkīrtanaparty. In this way arrange...[break]"
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:...weekend festivals from town to town?,Prabhupāda,"Town to town. What do you think this ideaHuh? Continue engagement. And as many men may join us, we can accommodate them. Every country.Yaj&#241aiḥsaṅkīrtanaprāyairyajantihisumedhasaḥ[SB11.5.32].I got this idea, one king, (indistinct), the grandson of Prthuraya, thisMahārājaPrithu, he performed so manyyaj&#241as</span> that on the surface of the earth, there were only <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/kusa"" class=""d"">ku&#347;a</a></span> grass scattered. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/yajna"" class=""d"">Yaj&#241a</a>,</span> they require <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/kusa"" class=""d"">ku&#347;a</a></span> grass. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/kusa"" class=""d"">Ku&#347;a</a></span> grass.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">&#346;y&#257;masundara:</span> What he was telling me was that the table itself has a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/jiva"" class=""d"">j&#299;va</a></span> soul, that the table is a person.</div>
<A NAME=""343079""></A><div id=""343079""> </div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> So that's what I was asking. 'Cause I said, ""Does the table have a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/jiva"" class=""d"">j&#299;va</a></span> soul?"" I was trying to ask that question.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">&#346;y&#257;masundara:</span>That's what completely threw me off. I thought, ""Oh..."" That means the table is a person, this is a person, this is a...</div>
<A NAME=""343082""></A><div id=""343082""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> A particular <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/jiva"" class=""d"">j&#299;va</a></span> soul was in that body. Then it is also proved that every <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/jiva"" class=""d"">j&#299;va</a></span> soul is individual. Although they are living combinedly, everything is individual.</div>
<A NAME=""343083""></A><div id=""343083""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> Well, doesn't... That's all right then. Now the...</div>
<A NAME=""343084""></A><div id=""343084""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> But that one <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/jiva"" class=""d"">j&#299;va</a></span> soul was prominent. He was visible. Others were in dormant condition. This proves that every individual soul is separate from the other; still, they can remain together. Just like the sunshine, they create... a small shining particles, combined together, molecules. So everything is combined spirit particles.</div>

<A NAME=""343088""></A><div id=""343088""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Just as sunshine is not covered, it is called cloudy. But this light, whatever light you are seeing, that is also sunshine. That is not different from the sunshine. And above the cloud, there is bright. So matter means when it is covered by something, it is matter. That covering is unconsciousness. That covering is also created of the sunshine, by the same energy. And then, by the same energy it is dissipated also. So the conclusion is living being, when it is covered by ignorance, that is material.</div>
<A NAME=""343089""></A><div id=""343089""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> But this, the body itself is sort of a manifestation of ignorance.</div>

<A NAME=""343093""></A><div id=""343093""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> Then there is some distinction, between the nature of the soul and the nature of the body.</div>
<A NAME=""343094""></A><div id=""343094""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> That distinction is inconceivable. You cannot make clear distinction. Therefore it is called <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/acintya"" class=""d"">acintya</a>.</span></div>

<A NAME=""343096""></A><div id=""343096""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. Everything. We distinguish matter and spirit. That distinction is inconceivable by you. You cannot make a clear distinction. Therefore it is called <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/acintya"" class=""d"">acintya</a> bhed&#257;bheda <a href=""/d/tattva"" class=""d"">tattva</a>,</span> inconceivable one and different, simultaneously.</div>
<A NAME=""343097""></A><div id=""343097""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">&#346;y&#257;masundara:</span> When you said that, once before, that the cells, all the cells in our body, each one is a living entity with a small body. Each one of those living entities covers itself with ignorance?</div>
<A NAME=""343098""></A><div id=""343098""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes.</div>
<A NAME=""343099""></A><div id=""343099""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">&#346;y&#257;masundara:</span> It takes a small body made out of matter.</div>
<A NAME=""343100""></A><div id=""343100""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> But that body means ignorance. <span class=""Italic"">&#346;ar&#299;ra <a href=""/d/avidya"" class=""d"">avidy&#257;</a> <a href=""/d/jala"" class=""d"">j&#257;la</a>.</span> This body is nothing but a network of ignorance.</div>
<A NAME=""343101""></A><div id=""343101""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">&#346;y&#257;masundara:</span> So then myself, I organize all these smaller cells. I organize them into my big body.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Whatever it may be, when you are covered, that is material. You try to understand. Covered by something. The same example. The sunshine is there, it is covered now. That covering also creation of the sunshine. So therefore the covering has no separate existence. Originally, the sunshine is everything. Is it clear?</div>
<A NAME=""343103""></A><div id=""343103""> </div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Whatever it may be. By your energy you are creating. This body is my creation. Just like I am the soul, I am here within this body. So I cut my hair; it is again growing. I do not know how I am creating, but I am creating. My nail is growing&mdash;I am growing, I am creating. But I do not know. That is ignorance.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> These questions are not to be discussed in public. These are very higher understanding. For public should be, ""This is matter, this is spirit."" That's all.</div>
<A NAME=""343109""></A><div id=""343109""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> Yes, but one of the devotees asked me one time, ""Why it is that when the body is dead that the fingernails continue to grow.""</div>
<A NAME=""343110""></A><div id=""343110""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> That is nonsense. Never grows.</div>
<A NAME=""343111""></A><div id=""343111""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> <a href=""/d/huh"" class=""d"">Huh</a>? They just play like that. And observe.</div>
<A NAME=""343112""></A><div id=""343112""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> It decomposes.</div>
<A NAME=""343113""></A><div id=""343113""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> But they say hair continues to come out sometimes from dead bodies.</div>
<A NAME=""343114""></A><div id=""343114""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Sometimes.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">&#346;y&#257;masundara:</span> I think you said once ... You answered that sometimes the fan turns a little bit after the plug.</div>
<A NAME=""343116""></A><div id=""343116""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> Yes. Mechanism, bodily mechanism has pulled the plug. That's what I said. Some material mechanism is still functioning like a machine.</div>
<A NAME=""343117""></A><div id=""343117""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> It has stopped, but maybe just like the fan is stopped, but still moving. Like that.</div>
<A NAME=""343118""></A><div id=""343118""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> So there are many different manifestations of energies. It is the oneness that they're all K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's energies. But there is also diversities.</div>
<A NAME=""343119""></A><div id=""343119""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Therefore we say <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/acintya"" class=""d"">acintya</a> bhed&#257;bheda.</span> You cannot clearly distinguish. It is one and different, at the same time. It is spirit and not spirit. You have to take it like that.</div>
<A NAME=""343120""></A><div id=""343120""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">&#346;y&#257;masundara:</span> Somehow or other, we create our own ignorance.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Everything is like that. Everything is spirit but at the same time, not spirit.

<A NAME=""343122""></A><div id=""343122""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Revat&#299;nandana:</span> Yes. He says because you can't see Him there.</div>
<A NAME=""343123""></A><div id=""343123""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. Therefore matter means when our consciousness is covered to understand <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, that is matter.</div>

<A NAME=""343126""></A><div id=""343126""> </div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> So far I am personally experienced, in our childhood there were not so many problems. Now India is faced with so many problems on account of imitating Western civilization.</div>
<A NAME=""343297""></A><div id=""343297""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Guest:</span> Not simply because of the increased population?</div>
<A NAME=""343298""></A><div id=""343298""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> There is no question of increased population. This is, I say always, this is foolishness.</div>
<A NAME=""343299""></A><div id=""343299""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Guest:</span> That's foolish?</div>
<A NAME=""343300""></A><div id=""343300""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. When you say ""increase of population,"" it is a proposal of foolish persons.</div>
<A NAME=""343301""></A><div id=""343301""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Guest:</span> Oh, so someone, someone who's foolish...</div>
<A NAME=""343302""></A><div id=""343302""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> No. Even the... Just like the birds and beast, they are also increasing their population. Yes. If you find one hole in the room, millions of ants will come out. So who is giving their food? There are millions of elephants in the forest. Who is giving their food? There are millions and trillions... There are 8,400,000 species of life. Out of that, eight million species are other than human being, and 400,000 species human being. Out of that, civilized persons are very few. And all the problems are in the civilized, so-called civilized population.</div>
<A NAME=""343303""></A><div id=""343303""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Guest:</span> And that's because, you would say that we have the wrong...</div>
<A NAME=""343304""></A><div id=""343304""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> No, I, I... We are believer in God. You see. So we know God is the original father. He is supplying maintenance for everyone. So there is no question of increasing population. If there is increase of population, God has enough resources to feed them. It is not the question of increasing population. But what is the question of demonic civilization.</div>
<A NAME=""343305""></A><div id=""343305""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Journalist (1):</span> Well, I was going to ask you about that, civilization.</div>
<A NAME=""343306""></A><div id=""343306""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. Yes. That demonic civilization is creating problems. Not the increase of population. This is not the fact. Now, so far I have studied, that in America, in Africa, in Australia, there are so much vacant places that the present population of the world, if it is increased ten times, still there is enough food...</div>
<A NAME=""343307""></A><div id=""343307""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Journalist (1):</span> And you think there's enough food.</div>
<A NAME=""343308""></A><div id=""343308""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> There is enough provisions. But we have made artificial divisions. ""This is America."" The Americans, they went from Europe, and they illegally occupied that place. Now they won't allow anyone to come there. Similarly, the Australians, they won't allow to come there. New Zealand, Africa. Why? Our philosophy: Everything belongs to God, and we are all sons of God. Everyone has got the right to live at the cost of God. This is our philosophy.</div>
<A NAME=""343309""></A><div id=""343309""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Journalist (1):</span> But the values of Western civilization have made that...</div>
<A NAME=""343310""></A><div id=""343310""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Western civilization created artificial. ""This is Africa, this is America, this is Europe...""</div>
<A NAME=""343311""></A><div id=""343311""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Journalist (1):</span> Yes. Therefore that's made living as children of God impossible.</div>
<A NAME=""343312""></A><div id=""343312""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. Because the one son of God is not allowing the other son to come in. And that he hasn't got the right to forbid. Just like your father has got ten sons. So all the tens sons have got the right to use the property of the father. That is law. Similarly, all the living entities, not only human beings. Birds, animals, birds, beasts&mdash;everyone. This is called spiritual, or transcendental, communism. According to Vedic civilization, a householder has to see that even a lizard in the room is not fasting, to see whether it has got his food. Even there is a snake in the house, the householder is to see whether the snake has got his food. A householder would stand on the street, and before taking his food, he will say loudly, ""If anyone is hungry, please come. Still I have got my food."" And if there is no response, then he takes <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/prasadam"" class=""d"">pras&#257;dam</a>.</span></div>
<A NAME=""343313""></A><div id=""343313""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Journalist (1):</span> That's a very difficult doctrine for many people in civilization...</div>
<A NAME=""343314""></A><div id=""343314""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Because... That is civilized. That is civilization. Animal civilization is that one dog, as soon as the other dog is coming: ""Yow! Yow! Yow! Why you are coming? Why you have come?"" Just like here. Here, everywhere. The immigration department, ""Oh, how long you will stay? Oh."" So many things. Why? A human being is coming... Vedic civilization is, even one is enemy, if he comes to your home, you receive him as, so friendly that he will forget that you are his enemy. Yes. That is...</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Journalist (1):</span> But it must be very difficult for you to...</div>
