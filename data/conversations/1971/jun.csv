Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Yes, you know, what is interesting... As it is here in our country, with our great interest in the history of old, old god, from this point of view our institute translated into Russian and published many, I may say, literary monuments of great Indian culture. I will have a pleasure to present you a copy of a booklet which was written here by me and my colleagues. It's account of Soviet studies of India. And here there is chapter, chapter second, ""Studies of Ancient Indian Texts in the U.S.S.R..."" You'll be interested to discover, we published not all but some, some in exceptions,Purāṇas.We published most of them, then some parts ofRāmāyaṇa,eight volumes in Russian,Mahābhārata...We have also second edition ofMahābhārata,translated by different people.KabukareArtha-śāstra(?) also was translated in full and published.Manu-smṛtialso translated in full and published with Sanskrit commentaries. And such a great interest... I think that all these publications was sold in a week. Now quite completely out of stock, this... It was impossible to get them in book market after month, such a great interest among reading people here in Moscow and the U.S.S.R. towards ancient Indian culture. And from this point of view we published, I must say, a lot of things, a lot of things.",Prabhupāda,"Now, amongst thesePurāṇas,theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamis called theMahā-purāṇa."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Mahā-purāṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So we have translated in English the full, with the original Sanskrit text, its transliteration, an English equivalent for each word, then translation, and then purport, explanation of the verse. In this way there are 18,000's of verses inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.And theācāryas,the great saintly sages who are the preachers of thisBhāgavatamthroughout India, their opinion is that it is the ripened fruit of the Vedic desire tree.Nigama-kalpa-tarorgalitaṁphalaṁidam[SB1.1.3].And it is accepted by all, I mean, Indian scholars, and especially LordCaitanya, He preached thisBhāgavata.So we have got that, complete in English translation. If you want to see some of them, we can show you."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:It seems to me that in the Moscow and Leningrad libraries we have nearly all major texts of ancient Indian culture, beginning fromVedas,original text in Sanskrit. For instance, we have in Lenin Library nearly six or eight editions of...",Prabhupāda,(Aside:) You have not brought any books? Eh?
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...Manu-smṛti.,Prabhupāda,You have not brought any books?Bhāgavata?
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Editions is there. Especially in Leningrad, you know, in Leningrad we have...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:...about, Leningrad branch, Leningrad branch of our institute—because institute was in Petorussia(?), founded in Leningrad—so in Leningrad now we have now a branch of our institute dealing mainly...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:...with the history of Asiatic culture. We have a million...(Aside:) Thank you very much. Here is a sample account of our book. You will find here some account of what has been translated and what else is being done in the history of Indian philosophy, and now with this Indian philosophy, history of Indian religion, and now with this Indian..., what is Hinduism now, just now in India also. It is very simple account of...",Prabhupāda,Hinduism is a very complex term. (laughs)
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Oh, yes, Hinduism. It is not all... It is really... To my understanding it is not religion from European point of view. It is a really a way of life...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:...religion, Indian, a way of philosophy, a way of life, a religion, everything...",Prabhupāda,"No, this Hinduism,Hindu, this word, is not a Sanskrit word. It is given by the Mohammedans. You know there is a river, Indus, which is..., Sanskrit name isSindhu.Sindhu."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"These Mohammedans, they pronounce ""S"" as ""H."" ""Hindus,"" ""Hindus."" Instead of  ""Sindus,"" they made it ""Hindus."" SoHinduis a term which is not found in the Sanskrit dictionary."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"But it has come into use. Real, I mean to say, cultural institution is calledvarṇāśrama,fourvarṇasand fourāśramas:brāhmaṇa, kṣatri,vaiśya,śūdra—these fourvarṇas—andbrahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,andsannyāsa.So according to Vedic concept of life, unless people take to this system or institution, institute ofvarṇaandāśrama,fourvarṇasand fourāśramas,actually he does not become a civilized human being. This... One has to take this process, four divisions ofvarṇasand four..., four divisions of social order and four divisions of spiritual order. That is calledvarṇāśrama.So India's culture is based on these four, eight system,varṇaandāśrama."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Varnāśrama.,Prabhupāda,"Varṇa,varṇāśrama.And in theBhagavad-gītā—perhaps you have readBhagavad-gītā—there is also the statement,cātur-varṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭaṁ[Bg.4.13].It is... This system is created originally byViṣṇu. So as everything is creation of the Supreme, they cannot be changed. That is a prevalent everywhere, that a... Sun. Sun is creation of the Supreme. So sunshine is here in America, in Russia, in India—everywhere. Similarly, thisvarṇāśramasystem is prevalent everywhere in some form or other. Just like thebrāhmaṇas.Thebrāhmaṇasmeans the most intelligent class of men, brain, brain of the society. Then thekṣatriyas,the administrator class. Then thevaiśyas,the productive class, and theśūdras,the worker class. These four classes of men are everywhere present in different names. And because it is creation by the original creator, so it is prevalent everywhere,varṇāśrama-dharma.[break] So have you seen this little, how we are translating this? You can see little. Originalśloka,its transliteration, then its English equivalent, then translation, then purport, each and every verse is being done like that, wholeBhāgavatamPurāṇa."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:But you know what is interesting to... It is the opinion of some European and old, old Russian scholars, thisvarṇāśramasystem...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:...is a bit late creation. If you would trace the oldsūtras,texts, of Vedic literature, you would find much more simple and egalitarian society. And there is an opinion that thisvarṇāśramasystem was introduced into Indian society on the late stage of Vedic era but not from the beginning, about... If you would analyze scientifically the old texts, you'll find that... [break]...human estimations. (laughs) As many brains, as many estimations...",Prabhupāda,(laughs) That's it.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...about the duration of this period because unfortunately the old classic India we have not so much information.,Prabhupāda,"But so far... So far we are concerned, thisBhagavad-gītā...It is mentioned in theBhagavad-gītā,cātur-varṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭam[Bg.4.13].Now, thisBhagavad-gītāwas spoken five thousand years ago, and in theBhagavad-gītāit is said that ""This system ofBhagavad-gītāwas first spoken by Me to the sun-god."" So if you take estimation of that period, it comes forty millions of years. So whether the European scholars can trace out the history of at least for five thousand years together, not to speak of forty millions?"
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So we have got evidences that hisvarṇāśramasystem is current at least for the five thousand years,varṇāśramasystem. And thisvarṇāśramasystem is mentioned in theViṣṇuPurāṇaalso.Varnāśramācaravatapuruṣeṇaparaḥpumān[Cc.Madhya8.58].Varnāśramaacaravata.So that is stated in theViṣṇuPurāṇa.And sovarṇāśrama-dharmais not a, within any historical period calculated in the modern age. It is natural. And in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamthe comparison is given, just like in your body, in my body, there are four divisions, the face, facial, or the brain division, and the arms division, the belly division, and the leg division, similarly, by nature's way these four divisions are existing in the social body. You may take history wherever you begin, but this is existing. A class of men, they are considered to be brain. A class of men, they are considered to be the arms, administrators. And a class of men, they are called productive class. So there is no need of tracing the history. It is naturally existing from the day of creation."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:According to so many... You have just told that in any society there are four divisions, but the case is not so easy to distinguish. For instance, one can group, one can group, group together, different social classes and professional groups into four divisions in any society. There's no difficulty. Only difficulty, for instance, in socialist society of our country and a socialist society how can you distinguish productive group and workers?",Prabhupāda,Just like you belong to the intelligent class of men.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Intelligent, yes, so...",Prabhupāda,So this is a division.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Yes, intelligent class, for instance,brāhmaṇas,if you can put together also with intelligentsia under thebrāhmaṇas...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Then administrative staff...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...everywhere.,Prabhupāda,Kṣatriya.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:From top to... From top to collective farm, for instance, iskṣatriyas.But who would be herevaiśyaand whośūdra?That is the difficulty because all others will workers, workers, anywhere, factory workers, collective farm workers and so on. So from this point of view...",Prabhupāda,From this point of view...
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:...there is a great distinction, in my opinion, between socialist society and all societies preceding socialist because in a modern western society you can group all social professions, classes, for instance, practically, very conditionally, you know, at least you can, thebrāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, kṣatriyas...Excuse me... Then thisvaiśya,this productive class, is owners...",Prabhupāda,That is...
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...of the means of production...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:...these factory owners, for instance.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:And theśūdrasare workers, menial workers. But here you have novaiśyasfrom this point of view because you have administrative staff... In fact, there is administrative staff. You can call themkṣatriyas.And thenśūdras,that's workers themselves. But not this intermediate class.",Prabhupāda,"That is stated,kalauśūdra-sambhavaḥ:""In this age practically all men will beśūdras.""That is... That is predicted. But if there are simplyśūdras,then the social order will be destroyed. You... Just like in spite of your state ofśūdras,abrāhmaṇais found here. And that is necessity. So if you do not divide the social order in such a way, then there will be chaos. that is the scientific estimation of theVedas.You may... You may belong for the time being to theśūdraclass, but to maintain the social order you have to train some of theśūdrasto becomebrāhmaṇa,some of theśūdrasto becomekṣatriyas.You cannot depend on theśūdras.Then there will be chaos. Neither you can depend only onbrāhmaṇa.Just like to fulfill the necessities of your body there must be a portion called the brain, there must be a portion called the arms, there must be a portion called the stomach, or the belly, and there must be a portion which is called the leg. The leg is also required, the brain is also required, the arm is also required—for cooperation, to fulfill the mission of the whole body. So any, any society you conceive, unless there are these four divisions, there will be chaos. It will be, not be properly, I mean to say, going on, smoothly going on. There will be some disturbance. Brain must be there. So at the present moment there is scarcity of brain. I am not talking of your state or my state. I am taking the world as it is. The brain... Formerly the Indian administration was going on in monarchy. Just like this picture. This picture is akṣatriyaking. Before his death he renounced his, I mean to say, royal order and he came to the forest to hear about self-realization. So if you want to maintain the peace and prosperity of the whole worldly social order, you must create a class of men very intelligent, a class of men very expert in administration, a class of men very expert in production, and a class of men to work. That is required. You cannot avoid it. That is the Vedic conception.Mukha-bāhūru-padebhyaḥ.They say,mukha...Mukhameans the face.Bahumeans the arm.Urumeans this, this, or waist. Andpada.So anywhere, either you take this state or that state—doesn't matter—unless there is a smooth, systematic establishment of these four orders of life, the state or the society will not go very smoothly."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Generally it seems to me that this oldvarṇāśramasystem to some extent practiced the nature of division of labor in ancient society. So now division of labor among people in any society is much more complicated and sophisticated. So it would be very...,Prabhupāda,Not complicated.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...conditionally(?) to group them in four classes because...,Prabhupāda,"The, the confusion, confusion has come into existence because in India in later days the son of abrāhmaṇa,without having the brahminical qualification, claimed to bebrāhmaṇa,and others, out of superstition or traditional way, they were accepted asbrāhmaṇa.Therefore the Indian social order has disrupted. But our, thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, we are picking up from everywherebrāhmaṇas,everywhere, because the world needs the brain of abrāhmaṇa.Just like here,MahārājaParīkṣit, although he was a monarch, he had a body of learned sages andbrāhmaṇasto consult, advisory body. It is not that the monarchs were independent. In the history it is found that some of the monarchs were not in order. They were dethroned by the brahminical advisory committee. Although thebrāhmaṇas,they did not take part in politics, but they would give advice to the monarch how to, I mean to say, execute the royal function. Just like not, not very old, very, say, about... What is the age of, I mean to say,Asoka? Say about thousands of years ago."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:As we call from our... In our terminology we call, in ancient and medieval India...",Prabhupāda,Med... Yes. In medieval India.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:...and old and feudal India, you are right, this was very often. And frombrāhmaṇa,brāhmaṇa,frombrāhmaṇasthe major part of height is(?) religious stuff (?) (rigid stock) in religious department(?). Even Mogul emperors, there werebrāhmaṇaswho advised modern Mogul emperors...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...in administration...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...and such like.,Prabhupāda,"Our predecessorācārya,RūpaGosvāmī, he was finance minister in the Mohammedan government. He was. When he resigned, the Nawab was not very satisfied, that ""I cannot relieve you because you are my right hand man. If you resign all of a sudden in this way, then I shall arrest you."" There is a long history. So that's a fact. Thebrāhmaṇaswere kept. So the advisory committee of the king... Now, as I was going to speak, Candragupta, Candragupta, just the lastestHinduking, Candragupta... Candragupta is the age of Alexander the Great because at that time, during Candragupta's..., little before Candragupta, Alexander the Great from Greece, they went to India and conquered some portion. So this Candragupta, when he became emperor, he had his prime minister, Canakya. Perhaps you heard this name, Canak...Ca-na-kya."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Canakya. Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. He was a great politician,brāhmaṇa.And under whose name in New Delhi all the foreign embassies, they are flocked together. Yes. It is called CanakyaPurī."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Hm hm. CanakyaPurī, yes, I know.",Prabhupāda,"So this CanakyaPaṇḍitawas a great politician andbrāhmaṇa.And asbrāhmaṇa,he was vastly learned. He has got some moral instruction. They're very valuable, still going on. In India school children are taught. So this CanakyaPaṇḍita, although he was prime minister, he maintained his brahminical spirit. He was not accepting any salary, yes, because forbrāhmaṇasto accept salary, it is understood that he becomes a dog. That is stated in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavata.He can advise, but he cannot accept. So he was living in a cottage, but he was prime minister. So this brahminical culture, the brahminical brain, is the standard of Vedic civilization. Just likeManu-smṛti.Manu-smṛti...You do not know. You cannot trace out the history, whenManu-smṛtiwas written. ButManu-smṛtiis considered so perfect that it is theHindulaw. The Hindus are governed byManu-smṛti.There was no need of passing daily a new law by the legislative assembly to adjust this social order. You see? The law given byManuwas so perfect that it can be applicable for all the time. This is perfect.Tri-kāla-jñāḥ.The word is there,tri-kāla-jñāḥ,past, present, future."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:But... I am sorry to interrupt you, but originally, to my knowledge, original Indian society, when, in the second half of Indian society, when in Calcutta by order of British administration was codified, so-called, you know, remember, ""Jantu Law,"" they called, a big digest ofHindulaw, there was a lot of change...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...called in.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, they manufactured another..."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:And this, the actualHindulaw which was used by Hindus, they're quite different from originalManu-smṛti.",Prabhupāda,"No, they have now made changes. Just like our late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. He made someHinducode. He introduced in thatHinducode the right of divorcing husband and wife. But these were not inManu-saṁhitā.And, of course, they are changing. If you like, you can change. But the social order also not exactly the same as it was before."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda,"And so many things. So they're changing. But before this modern age the wholeHindusociety was being governed byManu-smṛti.Manu-smṛti,yeah."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:In all periods in India...,Prabhupāda,"Manu-smṛti.Now they are changing so many. They... Strictly speaking, the modern Hindus, they are not strictly according to theHinduscripture."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda,"No. They are not... So our point is, we are not going to bring back the old type ofHindusociety. It is not that. Our..."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:It is impossible.,Prabhupāda,"It is impossible. Our idea is that best ideas from the original idea. Just like in theBhāgavatathere is a description of communistic idea, and it is being described toMahārājaYudhisthira. So if there is something good, good experience, why it should not be adopted? That is our point of view. And besides that, in the modern civilization they are missing one point: the aim of human life, scientifically. The aim of human life is self-realization,ātmā-tattvam.It is said,parābhavas tāvadabodha-jātaḥyāvannajijñāsaātmā-tattvam.Unless the human society comes to the point of self-realization, whatever they are doing, they are being defeated,parābhava.I think you know this word,parābhava.Parābhava. Parābhavas tāvadabodha-jātaḥ.So actually it is happening so. The modern society, human society, there is advancement, economic advancement, so many things, advancement. Still, in the matter of keeping peace and tranquility there is fight, individually, socially, politically, nationally. So if we think very cool-headed, then in spite of so much improvement in so many branches of knowledge, we are keeping the same mentality of quarreling. That is also visible in lower animal society. So our conclusion, according toŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,that this body, human body, it is not meant for working very hard for sense gratification. In the modern civilization the ultimate goal, aim, is sense gratification. That's all. Beyond that, they do not know anything more. They do not know what is next life. There is no department of knowledge or science, scientific department, to study what is there after life, after finishing this body. That is a great, I mean to say, department of knowledge. In theBhagavad-gītāit is said thatdehino 'sminyathādehe[Bg.2.13].Dehe.Dehameans this body. So there is adehinaḥwho owns the body,dehi.Sodehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā.Thedehi,the owner of the body, is within, and the body's changing from one form to another. The body of a child, baby, a certain type of form, it changes into another type of form when he's child, another type when boy, another type when he's young, another type, he's old. This is going on, but the owner of the body existing. Similarly, when this body will be completely changed, another body he will accept. So people do not understand this. As we are accepting different body even in this present life from babyhood to childhood, from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youthhood... That's a fact. Everyone knows it. I was a child, but that childhood body is no more. I have got a different body. Similarly, what is the difficulty to understand: when this body will be no more, I'll have to accept another body? It is great science."
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:As you know, there is two ultimate, two quite, I may say, opposite approaches to this problem. One approach is slightly different by different religions but in the same time, any religion recognizes in such or such form the change...",Prabhupāda,Take place.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Change of place of a spirit.,Prabhupāda,Transmigration.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Called transmigration of spirit, etc. As in Christian religion and in Buddhism andHindureligion...",Prabhupāda,"No, I'm not talking of religion, belief."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Yes. Yes.,Prabhupāda,I'm talking of science and philosophy.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,That is...
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:If we can... So science and philosophy. But another...,Prabhupāda,"One religion may accept. One may... That is not our purpose. We are talking on the point of that if the owner of the body is permanent in spite of different change of the body, then what is the difficulty to understand that when this body will be changed, the owner of the body will have another body?"
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:But another approach is that there is no separate own..., there is no separate..., no two phenomena, owner of the body and body.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:The body and owner of the body is the same.,Prabhupāda,No.
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:When body dies, the owner also dies.",Prabhupāda,No.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:There is no separate...,Prabhupāda,That... Why? Why there is no department of knowledge in university to study this fact scientifically? That is my proposition.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So that means they are lacking. It may be as you say, or it may be as I say, but there must be a department of knowledge, what is the... Now, recently one cardiologist, a doctor, he has accepted that there is soul, in Montreal and Toronto. I had some correspondence with him. So he is strongly in belief that there is soul. So that is another point of view, but we accept knowledge from authority. Authority. Just like this statement is given byKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇais accepted as the authority by all theācāryas,inBhagavad-gītā.Bhagavad-gītāis studied amongst the scholarly circle and philosophical circle still, all over the world. And this statement is given byKṛṣṇa:"
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Yes, I know.",Prabhupāda,So suppose we accept such statement without any argument. That is the way of Vedic understanding. Vedic understanding means you have to accept whatever is stated in theVedaswithout any argument.
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:So forget aboutVedas.Our approach is we don't believe in anything without argument. We can believe only on anything based on argument.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that..."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Here is the basic...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, that is allowed."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:...projecting (?).,Prabhupāda,"That is allowed. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,tadviddhipraṇipātenaparipraśnena[Bg.4.34],paripraśnenasevayā.Paripraṣna,argument, is allowed, but not with a challenging spirit. With a spirit to rightly understand.Praṇipātenaparipraśnena.That... Argument is not denied. But so far Vedic statements are there, they are infallible, infallible, and the followers of theVedas,they accept in that way. For example, just like cow dung."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"It is the stool of an animal. Now, the Vedic statement there is: ""As soon as you touch the stool of any animal, you are impure. You have to purify yourself by taking bath."" Even in your own stool... According toHindusystem, if you go to evacuate, after coming you have to take bath."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:This is quite intact with modern medicine knowledge...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,Guest:...that you must clean yourself.,Prabhupāda,Now...
Prof. Kotovsky:,"Prof. Kotovsky:Yes, that's right.",Prabhupāda,"But another place it is stated that ""Cow dung, although it is the stool of an animal, it is pure."" Even if you apply in an impure place, you become purified. Now, this is superficially contradicting. In one place it is said that ""The stool of an animal is impure. As soon as you touch, you have to be purified,"" and another place it is said that ""Cow dung is pure."" So according to our knowledge, it is contradictory."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"But those who are followers of theVedas,they are accepting. Is it not, cow dung, pure? Cow dung pure, it is not accepted by the followers ofVedas?"
Guest:,Guest:That is.,Prabhupāda,"And if you analyze chemically, you'll find the cow dung contains all antiseptic properties."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:This I don't know.,Prabhupāda,"You do not know, but there is a..."
Guest:,"Guest:Yes, one must try to realize it...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that... That... One Dr. Ghosh, professor of medical college, Lal Mohan Ghosh, he... I was medically connected in my previous life. So that Lal Mohan Ghosh analyzed it, and, it is his statement, it is full of, I mean to say, antiseptic properties. So Vedic statements, even sometimes you find it is contradictory, but if you analyze scrutinizingly, you find it is correct."
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:But maybe...,Prabhupāda,"There may be some exceptions, but, I mean to say, just like the cow dung is stool—this is an exception—but why this exception is accepted, that if you scientifically examine, analyze, you find it is correct?"
Prof. Kotovsky:,Prof. Kotovsky:That is due to analyze. That's right. That's from common sense point of view.,Prabhupāda,"Similarly, another, another instance is there. Just like conchshell. Conchshell is the bone of an animal. So according to Vedic instruction, if you touch the bone of an animal, you become impure. You have to take bath. You become impure. But this conchshell is kept in the deity room because it's accepted as pure by theVedas.So my point is that we accept Vedic laws in such a way, without argument, accept because it is stated in theVedas,and that is the principle followed by scholars. If you can substantiate your statement by quoting from theVedas,then it is accepted. You do not require to substantiate in other ways if you prove by Vedic quotation.Śruti-pramāṇa.It is calledśruti-pramāṇa.There are different kinds ofpramāṇa,evidences. Just like in the legal court if you can give quotation from the law books, your statement is accepted, similarly, all statements which you give, if they are supported byśruti-pramāṇa...I think you know.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes, I am answering. As I told you that this propaganda is meant for creating some <span class=""Italic"">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> all over the world because the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> element is lacking, so one who seriously comes to us, he has to become a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> So he has to adopt the occupation of a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> and he has to give up the occupation of a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/ksatriya"" class=""d"">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> or a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> But if one wants to keep his profession, at the same time wants to understand also, that is allowed. Just like we have many professors. There is Howard Wheeler, professor of Ohio University. He's my disciple. So he is continuing his professorship. But whatever money he's getting, almost he's spending for our, this <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. For <span class=""Italic"">g&#7771;hasthas,</span> those who are householders living outside, they are expected to contribute fifty per cent of the income for the society, twenty-five per cent for the family, and twenty-five per cent for his personal emergency. After all, in this world, if we live... So far we are concerned, we are <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>,</span> but you are a professor. If there is some emergency, you cannot go to beg. But I am a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>.</span> I can tell you that I am in difficulty. That is the system. So we have got four orders. Just like he's <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a>,</span> and he's <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>.</span> He has got his wife, children. So he's a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>.</span> He's a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a>.</span> Similarly, there is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>.</span> So that is <a href=""/d/caitanya"" class=""d"">Caitanya</a> Mah&#257;prabhu's teaching. It doesn't matter whether one is a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>,</span> householder, or renounced order or a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></span> or a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> or <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> It doesn't matter. If anyone understands the science of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he becomes the spiritual master.

And these boys are so much after God, and we could not deliver them?"" They're admitting. Their fathers, their parents, come to me. They also flatly offer their obeisances and say, ""Swamiji, it is our great fortune that you have come. You are teaching God consciousness."" So on the contrary, I have got reception from other countries. And India also, as you inquired of India, all other sects, they're admitting that before me many hundreds of swamis went there, but they could not convert to <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness a single person. They are admiring that. And so far I am concerned, I don't take any credit, but I am confident that because I am presenting the Vedic knowledge as it is, without any adulteration, it is being effective.

And after understanding <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> he remained a fighter. So we don't want to change the position. Just like you are a respectable professor, teacher. We don't say that you change your position. We have come to convince you about our philosophy. That's all.

That means his consciousness was changed. He remained a fighter. He was a fighter, he remained a fighter, but he changed his consciousness. We want that.

No. But we try to make them understand that ""There is a great necessity of you to understand this consciousness, <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness.""

I could not eat fruit. Now your country, <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has given so nice, so nice flowers, and so nice Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. And that country is very proud of advancing, but there is no fruit, there is no flower, there is no <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, and there is no freedom. And this is the... They are proud. You see? ""We are advanced."" This is the... There is a story, one worshiper of <a href=""/d/durga"" class=""d"">Durg&#257;</a>... In Bengal, they worship <a href=""/d/durga"" class=""d"">Durg&#257;</a> <a href=""/d/mata"" class=""d"">M&#257;t&#257;</a>. So it is a story, the <a href=""/d/durga"" class=""d"">Durg&#257;</a> <a href=""/d/mata"" class=""d"">M&#257;t&#257;</a>, the Goddess <a href=""/d/durga"" class=""d"">Durg&#257;</a> is asking the devotee, ""My dear boy, you are happy?"" ""Yes, mother, I am very happy. Simply two things wanting."" ""What is this?"" ""I have no food, I have no clothing."" Just see. This is story, just try to understand, that ""I am happy, but two things wanting: no food, no clothing."" Is that happiness? No food, no clothing. Similarly, this Russian country, they are very much proud of advancement, but no food sufficient and no freedom. No food and no freedom, that's all. This is the sum and substance.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para"">So in your country also that position may come. Now in America you are happy. Because the nature is changing,<I> <a href=""/d/jagat"" class=""d"">jagat</a>. <a href=""/d/jagat"" class=""d"">Jagat</a> </I>means which is changing. So before any further changes come, you spread this <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness all over your country. You should utilize these fruits and flowers for <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and be happy. Don't slip down. That is my request. Whatever I could do, I have done. Now it is up to you to spread this movement all over the world. Don't go away. There is some tendency, somebody. Therefore, I ask you, no. This is all nonsense. This is <I>m&#257;y&#257;'s</I> peeping, ""Why you are working so hard for a sentiment, chanting and dancing? Come on, take to service and be happy with your wife and children."" This is <I><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a>.</I> This is <I><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a>.</I> I did not ask my students to marry to become a lost child. I wanted to give them some facility, because you cannot do without wife. But now I am seeing that some of them are slipping away. This is not to be done, no. Every one of us as good as <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></I> because we have sacrificed everything for <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">Sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></I> does not mean simply having no wife and children, he's a <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></I>. No. Nothing to possess except <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. That is <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></I>. One should know that ""I will have simply <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, nothing more."" Then he is <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>.</I> This mentality, that ""I have nothing to serve, I have nobody to serve except <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>."" But if you serve <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, you will serve everyone. Just like I was teaching this Indian gentleman. The same process. If you pour water on the root of the tree, automatically the branches, the leaves, and the flowers are all served. If you put the foodstuff here, not here, not here, then automatically this is served. Although the foodstuff is here, automatically this is served, this is served, this is served, this is... Everybody is served. This is practical. If you serve <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, then all service will be included. They are serving humanitarian and so on. Suppose I, I am Indian, I came to your country. Why I came to your country in this old age? That is service. To be <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious, that's the best service. Without any distinction of <a href=""/d/caste"" class=""d"">caste</a>, creed, country, color. No. Everyone should have <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. This is the best service. Go everywhere, every part of the world, and give <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. That is the best service you can do. And actually, they are now feeling, because they are Indians. Even in India, where there are so many devotees of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but when they saw ""These American devotees are so nice,"" thirty thousand people were coming daily. And what was our magic? This man was asking me, ""Swamiji, what magic you have got?"" I said, ""I have got this magic that I don't tell lie. I don't make 'This rascal is God.' God is <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. That is my magic. I don't bluff people. Here is God. See God, be with God, serve God. That's my business."" Why God should be unseen? You see <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. If <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says that ""I am taste of the water,"" while you are drinking water, tasting, ""Oh, here is <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>.""

Because according to Vedic civilization everyone has to take <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a> </I>at a certain age. So as a matter of routine if he takes <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a></I>... Just like this old man I was asking that ""Now you have children grown up, why don't you take <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a></I>?"" But he is hesitating. Nobody likes, because <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a></I> life is difficult. So first there is <I>ku&#7789;&#299;caka </I> means he gives up the connection of the family life, takes <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a></I> officially, but he is not accustomed to maintain himself independently; therefore, he goes out of the village and makes a cottage and lives there. And the foodstuff, the home supply, that is called <I>ku&#7789;&#299;ca</I>. <I><a href=""/d/kuti"" class=""d"">Ku&#7789;&#299;</a></I> means cottage. Then when he is little practiced, then he says family members that ""Don't bring foodstuffs. I shall go to every village man and ask something for my food. I shall depend on them, not on you."" That is called <I>bah&#363;daka</I>. <I><a href=""/d/bahu"" class=""d"">Bah&#363;</a></I> means many. Not accepting food from one place but from many. Then when he is prac... Because first problem is problem, when he is practiced, ""Now <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is giving us food, so why shall I remain in one place? Let me preach."" That is called <I>parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya,</I> when he is preaching. <I>Parivr&#257;jaka. Parivr&#257;jaka </I>means wandering all over. Then when he is experienced, when his preaching is done, he can sit down in one place. At that time, he can chant simply <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> like <a href=""/d/haridasa"" class=""d"">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura. And if he imitates from the very beginning, he will be spoiled, that's all. Because in the beginning, if I take <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, then it is (indistinct). (laughter) Don't do this. Always be busy. First stage, last stage. When one is <I><a href=""/d/paramahamsa"" class=""d"">paramaha&#7745;sa</a> </I>just like <a href=""/d/haridasa"" class=""d"">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura, three hundred thousand times, no eating unless he finishes his chanting. No eating, no sleeping. That is another thing. ""I shall eat so much, I shall sleep so much, and I shall do nothing, simply chanting."" No. That is not recommended by my <a href=""/d/guru"" class=""d"">Guru</a> <a href=""/d/maharaja"" class=""d"">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. He says that you are cheating people. (Bengali) There is a song written by Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta <a href=""/d/sarasvati"" class=""d"">Sarasvat&#299;</a>: ""What kind of <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> you are?"" (Bengali) ""Your chanting <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in a secluded place,"" (Bengali) ""is simply cheating."" What do you know what you are chanting? First of all prepare yourself to come to the stage of perfect chanting. This is <I><a href=""/d/seva"" class=""d"">sev&#257;</a>.</I> Always be engaged in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's service: how to decorate the temple, how to invite people, giving the feast, write books, distribute books and knowledge. In this way don't sit idly. Always be engaged, always. Just like our Karandhara, he has taken so much responsibility. He is doing. I am very pleased. He is prepared to do the masonry work and building work and distribution of book, accounting. In this way, we shall be always busy. Find out some work. I have no work now. Of course, the sixteen rounds must be chanted hundred percent. Rest time, simply find out where is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's work. Why sixteen rounds? It only takes two hours, you have got twenty-four hours. What you will do twenty-four hours? You cannot sleep more than six hours, seven hours, that's all. So two hours chanting and seven hours sleeping. Sleeping is a very important thing in your country, but reduce it. As much as you reduce sleeping and eating, you will become advanced.</div>

Therefore, this <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a>, </I>to go out of home by force, that means to avoid sex life, <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</I> You see? I think those who have got children, they should take<I> <a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a></I> now and preach. That is my idea. Not (indistinct) idea, because all the great sages, they waited if they are married. Just like <a href=""/d/kapila"" class=""d"">Kapila</a> <a href=""/d/muni"" class=""d"">Muni</a>..., <a href=""/d/kardama"" class=""d"">Kardama</a>, <a href=""/d/kardama"" class=""d"">Kardama</a> <a href=""/d/muni"" class=""d"">Muni</a>. <a href=""/d/kardama"" class=""d"">Kardama</a> <a href=""/d/muni"" class=""d"">Muni</a>, he was a great <a href=""/d/yogi"" class=""d"">yogi</a>. So he was thinking of marrying, so <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> sent him good wife, <a href=""/d/devahuti"" class=""d"">Devah&#363;ti</a>, a king's daughter. So he thought, ""I was thinking of marrying, so <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has sent. All right, let me marry."" But he made a condition to her father that ""I can accept your daughter as my wife so long she has no children. As soon as she has children, I shall go away."" So the father agreed, ""Whatever you like, you can do. I'm just placing my wife in your custody."" So the <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>...,</I> when there is a child of the wife, I think one can accept <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</I></div>
<A NAME=""341657""></A><div id=""341657""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para"">But preaching is our most important business. People are suffering for want of this <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. So as representative of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, it is our duty to enlighten them, and we should accept all kinds of... But there is no difficulty. Where is the difficulty? I think we are living better than anyone in the world. (laughter) Where is the difficulty? Simply we have to be very sincere devotee of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, that's all. Everything <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> will supply. Everything. So in that position, go on preaching. Don't be tottering. You have taken a great responsibility; go on executing it. Don't fight amongst yourselves for petty things. Go on, advance. <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. (devotees offer obeisances) Now we are going to have a great ceremony in India, M&#257;y&#257;pur. They have got... I have purchased one land. I took contribution 25,000 from Birla. I wanted 100,000, he gave me 25,000. That's all right. So with that money I purchased one land. So it is just to be developed. The foundation stone, cornerstone laying down. In India we require another..., altogether at least one hundred men, Americans. So contribute some men from each and every center. We have got fifty centers..., how many centers now?</div>
<A NAME=""341658""></A><div id=""341658""> </div>

<A NAME=""341660""></A><div id=""341660""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> So give one man from each center. It doesn't require that he is very advanced. Advancement will be done by training, by practical application in life. If you send from each center one man to India... If you can send more, that's all right. But at least one man. In India we have got many things to do. Because the business in India is important in this respect, that partly due to their subjugation by foreigners, their original culture has been killed.  Just like in India, they did not know drinking tea, drinking wine, meat-eating, illicit sex. They did not know. Even fifty, a hundred years before, they did not know. These Britishers, in order to control them, very silently introduced all these things. I know in our childhood, this drinking of tea was unknown to any family. Meat-eating, there was no question. Just like in my life, I do not know what is meat-eating, do not know womanizing(?) or illicit sex life, because we are trained in that way. So due to foreign domination, they were killed; and after independence, these rascal leaders, they are killing it: ""What is the wrong in meat-eating? What is the wrong in drinking?"" They are canvassing: ""Eat chickens, eat eggs,."" This is going on. So at the present moment there is great propaganda from the side of the government and others to kill India's original culture. So when Americans go there and preach and they see, ""Oh, so nice <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, so nice devotee and so pure,"" they will become attracted, because that is their original culture. At heart they want to do that, but by artificial means they are being forced to accept something else. So when they see these foreigners and Americans so...  And government is not very favorable of my movement there, because it is natural when the Americans exhibit a nice, pure <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, they come attracted. Just like Calcutta and Bombay, what was there? The same Deity was and <I><a href=""/d/sankirtana"" class=""d"">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</a></I> was there and I was speaking say for a half an hour. But why these forty thousand, thirty thousand people were coming? They were coming to see, ""Oh, how Americans have taken to this philosophy(?)."" That is their surprise. They are giving credit only for that purpose. This man also. So there is good chance of preaching in India in this respect. We want some men to preach there. It will be great work. So I think in each center, from each center you can contribute one man, and some of you leaders may go. There are already, organize. People are very much attracted. They are wanting..., giving us money, they want to give us place, there is no scarcity of food, there is no question. But this Immigration Department, they will harass. But we have to manage somehow or other. We shall have to keep always at least 100 men in India. So how to do it? That we will consider and do it. That's all. (devotees offer obeisances) Now chalk out your plan how to preach nicely all over the world. So Vi&#7779;&#7751;ujana <a href=""/d/maharaja"" class=""d"">Maharaja</a>, how many centers?</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> That I tell you, not immediately. But our main business is preaching.

The real work is preaching. Just like <a href=""/d/ramananda"" class=""d"">R&#257;m&#257;nanda</a> <a href=""/d/raya"" class=""d"">R&#257;ya</a> was a <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a></I> and Lord <a href=""/d/caitanya"" class=""d"">Caitanya</a> was a <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>, </I>but He was taking lesson from <a href=""/d/ramananda"" class=""d"">R&#257;m&#257;nanda</a> <a href=""/d/raya"" class=""d"">R&#257;ya</a>. This is <I><a href=""/d/caitanya"" class=""d"">Caitanya</a>-<a href=""/d/lila"" class=""d"">l&#299;l&#257;</a></I>. He is a <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></I> and He is God Himself, He is taking lesson from a <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">grhastha</a></I> who is His disciple. So the real thing is preaching must go on sincerely. This <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>, v&#257;naprastha,</I> these are material regulative principles. Real life is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's service. That we have to do, that's all. So whatever position is suitable for you, you accept. You remain as a <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>,</I> remain as <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>,</I> remain as <I><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></I> as it becomes suitable for you, but preach. That is the main business. If you lacking in preaching and become a <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>,</I> what is the use of <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a>? </I>Better... A <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a> </I>is better. Just like I asked Gaurasundara to go to Hawaii. He was just a boy, but he did. Now there is center, nice. So I'm very glad. So you are also doing that. It doesn't matter whether <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>.</I> Karandhara is <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>.</I> But we have to serve <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> very nicely. That is our main criteria. So we have to see in what position I can serve better <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. That is our policy. Otherwise, either <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a> </I>or <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>,</I> there's no difference. <a href=""/d/caitanya"" class=""d"">Caitanya</a> <a href=""/d/mahaprabhu"" class=""d"">Mah&#257;prabhu</a> says,</div>

So we have to become like that. It doesn't matter what we are, but whether I am preaching nicely. That is required. But still there is some regulative principles like <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></I> and <I><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></I> will be like this, <I><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a> </I>will be like this.

So you have got good opportunity, you have got good name, <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement, it is being appreciated. So live very cautiously and preach very cautiously and seriously, then in this one life you will become successful, go back to home, back to Godhead. One life.
