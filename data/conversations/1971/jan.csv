Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. (laughter) Many, many? Without mosquito curtain you cannot sleep."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):No, we can sleep. AtAdvaitaBhavanthere's a fair amount of mosquitos at night, but there's not so many that you can't sleep without a mosquito coil burning.",Prabhupāda,That's all right. [break]
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):The rats in Hawaii are not so big as the rats here. They're only about this big, the body.",Prabhupāda,Every house there is rats?
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):Not every house, no.",Prabhupāda,At leastAdvaitaBhavanhas got.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):We were getting a cow but we joined ISKCON just before we got the cow. We were going to get one for four hundred dollars. It was giving sixteen quarts a day and had a calf.,Prabhupāda,Sixteen quarts?
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):A day, yes. There was a small calf also.",Prabhupāda,There must be grazing ground for cows. Then there is no problem.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):There was a grazing ground. The lawn must grow.,Prabhupāda,"What is that? Are they cutting? These are not important thing. (end) Vivekananda has influence here in higher class, among the educated class. They talk about Vivekananda and this and that, nonsense. In your country, fortunately, that opposition was not there. There was no influence of Vivekananda class men. Here amongst the educated class there is influence of all these rascals, Vivekananda, Aurobindo, and... That is one defect. But in the mass there is no influence. In the class, educated class. Because educated class means wine, women, meat, and Vivekananda allows this. That is the point. Vivekananda has no distinction of eating. ""Eat any... AllBrahman, allNārāyaṇa. You areNārāyaṇa. Goat isNārāyaṇa. SoNārāyaṇais going in the belly ofNārāyaṇa. What is the wrong? OneNārāyaṇais going, being absorbed by anotherNārāyaṇa."" But he is not agreeable to be eaten by a tiger, another tigerNārāyaṇa."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:They actually say that?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:""OneNārāyaṇais being absorbed by another.""",Prabhupāda,"One respectable pleader in Allahabad, I said, ""Why you are eating this?"" We also find that he's a very religious man. So I inquired. He was just like our father; still, I inquired. He said, ""No, what is the wrong there?Nārāyaṇa,Brahman. So oneBrahmanis going into the belly of anotherBrahman,Brahmanbeing absorbed,brahmeti.""So they have got so dangerous theory. But still, we shall not hesitate to kick on their face but because they are making a propaganda, it should be peaceful. But I become very much agitated with this nonsense because I know they are creating havoc.HareKṛṣṇa. Come on. (door closes) So many rascals.HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa..."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:So yesterday we went to that place, that swami with the silver glasses and black beard that always gives his respect to you.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:Well, he has become head swami of this temple, very big, very nice place.",Prabhupāda,Very nice place?
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Yes. Hodgepodge but very...,Prabhupāda,They have.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:Yes. Yes. A big marble statue ofBuddha, very costly, and tiles fromJapan.",Prabhupāda,Tiles?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):I was told it was built by one American. I don't know who.,Prabhupāda,So why not give us that place?
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:I don't think he's prepared to do that.,Prabhupāda,They have residential quarters? They have made some residential quarter?
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:I didn't see any residential quarter. Mostly temple.,Prabhupāda,Very big temple?
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:It's one big temple with different rooms. Very large, very nice.",Prabhupāda,Better than thisGītāBhavan?
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:No, I don't think it's better thanGītāBhavan.",Prabhupāda,"It was simply attempted, not finished."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Not finished.,Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇa,HareKṛṣṇa... Oh, thank you. Why not spread those blankets? Then you can... They are being used?"
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:There is a blanket in your room.,Prabhupāda,Blanket or mattress.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:They have blankets in their rooms. They left them in their rooms.,Prabhupāda,Bring mattress and spread. (Hindi) Sit down. This is comfortable.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):In God's temple, what human wants? And what type of life he wants so that he can be happy?",Prabhupāda,Not upon that. You spread separately. You have no bed sheet? Bed sheet you can spread. The human demand is happiness.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Happiness, yes. But happiness means increase in which is already happy. It is...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now, the thing is, what is that happiness? That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Sukhamātyantikaṁyattadatīndriya-grāhyam:[Bg.6.21]""The absolute happiness or the perpetual happiness or the greatest happiness is that which is enjoyed by supernatural senses."""
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Would that be by all the senses—mind, intelligence...?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, everything but in their supernatural, not in this condition."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Not in this?,Prabhupāda,Condition.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):You see, otherwise it is said that when a person is happy with the self, happy with others...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. No, no. Try to understand. He has got his senses. These senses are now covered with the coating of material conception of life. Therefore this sense pleasure is not complete or perfect. Just like everyone has got... Now, you have got your tongue. Now, the tongue, when it is coated you cannot taste the things. So the coating ismāyā."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):What I was, missing me was in this degree, that just like here, people, why we are, we got the news in our senses, our mind sees or perceives...",Prabhupāda,"These are living, symptoms of living condition."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Living condition. So, but we are not affected by air, which is most required and most special for our use. Because it is abundant, and it will be given to every person at all the times, in all circumstances, therefore we do not keep it under lock and key. Western countries, though they have...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. There is no question of Western-Eastern."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, I was speaking of materialism and spiritualism. I was talking on that point, that though we see, I mean, I don't say have made it, but yet because there is no what kind of life they want, or in our Eastern countries, because they are...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. If you study the whole thing in that way—Western-Eastern... There is no question of Western-Eastern. It is the question of the living entity."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, how to live in such a way where there is no dearth of thing as well as there is no continuing of that need that a man becomes lost? That is the...",Prabhupāda,That is the point.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):That is the point. And for that, what kind of spiritual should we lead?",Prabhupāda,"That is... That I am going to explain, that... That is one line:sukhamātyantikaṁyattadatīndriya-grāhyam[Bg.6.21].Thissukhamātyantikaṁis being searched both by the Western, Eastern, everyone, even cats, dogs, everyone. But the cats and dogs, animals, they cannot adjust what is thatātyantikaṁsukham.But human being can. So human being, there is no question of Eastern and Western. It is a question of degree only. But actually everyone is searching after that perpetual happiness. So it is a problem for everyone, and that problem can be solved byKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):By?,Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇaconsciousness. This is the..., I mean to say, a rough scheme, rough estimation. Now, howKṛṣṇaconsciousness can solve this problem, that is a detailed thing. But this is a fact. It is not the question of Eastern-Western. It is the problem of all living entities."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, living entities. Human, actually we have.",Prabhupāda,"Not even human life, even animal life. There are 8,400,000s of different kinds of bodies. So this is a problem for everyone. Now in other species of life than the human form, they cannot solve. They have no power. But a human being can solve."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, they have got understanding.",Prabhupāda,Yes. And that solution isKṛṣṇaconsciousness.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What do you mean by that?,Prabhupāda,"That is a detailed question, ""How it can be?"""
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, but are we satisfied with the past...",Prabhupāda,You will be never satisfied withoutKṛṣṇaconsciousness.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What I mean was it really or were we at that time...?,Prabhupāda,"Which time? What do you mean ""that time""?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):That time means at the time of LordKṛṣṇa. Were we completely...,Prabhupāda,At the time ofKṛṣṇa... You are taking simply the portion of the time whenKṛṣṇawas present. You are saying about that. ButKṛṣṇais present always.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, but if you say that, in that way, then he gets because...",Prabhupāda,"Just likeKṛṣṇasays in theBhagavad-gītā, raso 'hamapsukaunteya:[Bg.7.8]""I am the taste in the water."" Now, this taste in the water is perpetual. WhenKṛṣṇawas physically present orKṛṣṇais not physically present, this is a perpetual fact. Is it not? Do you think the taste in the water was different whenKṛṣṇawas present and the taste of water is different now?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, it cannot be.",Prabhupāda,"Similarly, He says,prabhāsmiśaśi-sūryayoḥ:""I am the shining of the sun and the moon."" In this way, if you study what isKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then you'll find thatKṛṣṇaconsciousness is the only solution for that highest perfectional stage of happiness."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):We are giving names; therefore we become confused because in our God incarnation...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. If there is name why you be confused? If your name is Mr. such and such but you do not know the name, that is the confusion."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Because so many names have been given to these same things...,Prabhupāda,"But that is in theśāstrait is said, ""There are so many names of God. Out of all of them,Kṛṣṇais the principal."" God's name is given... Just likeKṛṣṇaappeared as the son ofVasudeva; therefore He is calledVāsudeva.Kṛṣṇaplayed inVṛndāvanaas the son ofNandaMahārājaandYaśodā; therefore He is calledYaśodā-nandana.Kṛṣṇaacted as the driver, chariot driverArjuna. Therefore He is known asPārtha-sārathī.So His name... All these names are according to His different activities. So He has got unlimited activities, and therefore He has got unlimited names. So out of all these names,Kṛṣṇais the supreme or the prime becauseKṛṣṇameans all-attractive.Kṛṣṇameans all-attractive. So God, if God is not all-attractive, He cannot be God. So one God is attractive for me, another God is attractive for... He is not supreme God."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Reason we take the name of the God or anything is to achieve the supreme happiness or...,Prabhupāda,"That supreme happiness is different thing. We are talking of God's name. First of all let us understand that God's name, we have different God's name according to God's activities.Madhusūdana. Because He killed the demonMadhu, therefore His name isMadhusūdana.Mādhava. Because He is the husband of goddess of fortune-Mameans goddess of fortune-therefore He isMādhava. All the names you analyze. Similarly,Kṛṣṇais also the name of God because He is all-attractive. Now, how you can deny that God is not all-attractive? Is it possible? God is all-attractive. Can you deny this fact?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, there is no denying, you see, because we only know that all-attractiveness in Śyāmasundaram.",Prabhupāda,"Śyāmasundaram... But the Śyāmasundaram means He is blackish, still, He is so beautiful that thousands of Cupids cannot be compared with Him.Kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ[Bs.5.30].Kandarpa-koṭi.Cupid is supposed to be the most beautiful, but aboutKṛṣṇait is stated that:"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):That is also charm in that.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. But still, He's still charming. Because it is all transcendental, we cannot compare the blackish cloud. It is simply given, an idea, that it is like blackish cloud. But immediately it is said, still,kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁgovindamādi-puruṣaṁtamahaṁbhajāmi[Bs.5.30].So God has many names, and according to your conception, you can have God's name also. But out of all those names, many thousands and unlimited different types of names,Kṛṣṇais the principal name becauseKṛṣṇameans all-attractive. You cannot say that God is not all-attractive. And if you use that sense, all-attractive, this is the word,Kṛṣṇa."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):What I was... You see, I was trying to...",Prabhupāda,"Now, the difficulty is don't try to invent something about God. That is not good."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, not invention.",Prabhupāda,"No, you have to take the version of theśāstras;then it will be possible. If you invent something, try to speculate on something, it will not be successful."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I'm not, you see... In the middle, I may be speculating or you see, trying to... Coming to the human aspect itself, now so many want happiness. Happiness is checked up because of...",Prabhupāda,That material coating.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Material things.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Now, we want... Because this want is there... Want is made by own nature and there is no way throughout our... Now when we earning means there's so much contami..., mean, sea of...",Prabhupāda,That is not happiness.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):I am just coming to that. I was...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now, one point is that earning or begging-beg, borrow or steal—that is not happiness. Because to acquire a standard of happiness you have to beg, you have to earn, or you have to steal, so that is not happiness."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):No. What I am saying is that as long as a man lives...,Prabhupāda,"But we are not talking of ""as long as man lives."" He lives eternally."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, it is eternal.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):And it is eternal bondage there.,Prabhupāda,No. Bondage for so long you are in this material bondage.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):In some form...,Prabhupāda,"No, first of all you have to understand in the spiritual..."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, even there is spiritual form, one has to live in certain form, without which...",Prabhupāda,That is natural form. That is not a conventional form. Just like you have dressed yourself with black coat. It is not your natural form. So material...
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Has spirit no want?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, no want."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Without it, you see...",Prabhupāda,"Everything you desire, it is present immediately."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):You mean the spirit has got subtle form, though it may be exact form?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. Yes."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Though mind has got no form outside but mind has a form.,Prabhupāda,"The spirit, he has a form."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Intelligence is also accepting...,Prabhupāda,"These are different coating. Just like you have got your form, therefore your coat has got a form."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, I was thinking in this form.",Prabhupāda,"Don't think like that way. First of all you try to understand. Because you have got a form, your coat has got a form. You try to understand this."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, water, though may not have form, but it has got form.",Prabhupāda,"Why may not? You try to understand practically. You have got a form, therefore your shirt has got a form, your coat has got a form."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):That spirit has this form, no?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So because originally you have got hand, your coat has got hand. Because originally you have got hand, your shirt has got hand. Therefore this form, the material form which you are seeing, it is coating only."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Material form of what?,Prabhupāda,"You, me, everything."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, ""me"" means what? A spirit?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):That is what I say. Any spirit will have certain form.,Prabhupāda,Not certain form. He has got his original form.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Original means all the... We are living from the eternal...,Prabhupāda,Yes. Eternally you have got a form.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):From the eternal we have got certain form.,Prabhupāda,"That is material. Past certain form, that is material. But you have got an original spiritual form."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Spiritual form is there but due to the bond man has taken this form.,Prabhupāda,This form is being developed according to your mental condition.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Mental conditions are due to want.,Prabhupāda,"Subtle form, subtle form."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Those are again due to want.,Prabhupāda,Due to want? Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):All these forms are due to want.,Prabhupāda,Want. That want because you are in the material condition.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Every person in a material... Spirit in matter remains because both are there.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Now, as we have got a material form...",Prabhupāda,Spirit has got no material form. Spirit has got spiritual form.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Spiritual form but yet also it has got a material form.,Prabhupāda,Because he has come... Just like you have accepted this kind of coat. I have got a different kind of coat. She has got a different kind of coat.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Yes. According to that there is...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So as I liked, so I have got shirt and coat. This is material. But originally, spiritual form is the same as you have got, I have got, she has got a form, everyone. That is original form."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Now, our question... (indistinct) We try. Now, question of earning also, the definition is not here, being...",Prabhupāda,The question of earning comes so long you have got this material form. But from the spiritual form there is no question of earning.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):In what way we will live in that spiritual form?,Prabhupāda,"That you have to know. That you have to know.Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ[Bs.5.37].That spiritual form means complete blissfulness, complete knowledge, and eternity."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Turiya.,Prabhupāda,"Turiya,yes."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):In thatturiya...,Prabhupāda,"This isturiyalife, complete blissfulness, complete knowledge, and eternity."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):You see, because it is a creation of the world... (indistinct) And that means that matter is there.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Matter is always there.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Ah. We want to live and enjoy, therefore this universe and all these things. Now, in what perfect form? Because everywhere, in everything, there is a best. Now how everything should take?",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):The universal form should come to the best. That is the point.,Prabhupāda,Don't talk of universal form. First of all talk of your form. Try to understand your form. Then go universal.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Am I separate from matter.,Prabhupāda,You are not separate. Are you not separate? Then why you are talking with me? Are you not separate with me? Why you have come to inquire from me?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, no, because we...",Prabhupāda,First of all try to... Are you not separate from me?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):In material way, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Any way. Any way, are you not separate from me?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, every drop is separate from one another.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. Every individual person is separate from one another, every individual person. So how do you say they are one?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Every individual is separate, but when we come in theprema...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Then every person, until it is the best...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):...is just an object of...(?),Prabhupāda,Yes. That is possible. Even... Don't think that when that stage will come there will be no individuality.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Individuality will be there. I do not say that it will not be there.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):What I was saying was particular individual in a particular way. Therefore the shape of world is in today is off. But if every individual takes the destined way, which is good enough for every person, then all things can change at once.",Prabhupāda,"Now, why do you way that thinking will be stopped?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I do not say, sir. I...",Prabhupāda,"So then you say who will think? Thinking will be there, individuality will be there, but there will be no disagreement."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Individuality will be there for the self as well as for all.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):That is what I mean.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Now, how that kind of living or what kind of religion is that, on that...",Prabhupāda,That you have to learn from the authorized Vedic literature. You cannot imagine. You cannot speculate. You have to learn from authority.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Authority...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Suppose if you want to go to Germany. Now you have no idea how the German people live or their, how they are, what is their culture. So you have to learn. Here is a boy, German. You have to learn from him what kind of life there is. Similarly, there is a life like that. Now, what kind of life that is, we have to ask from a person who has realized that life."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):There are two things. I am still, I'm still... that we are raised upon this material life (indistinct) that may be available just like air. Air we do not keep the air under lock and key. There is no dearth of time, no dearth of energy, no dearth of resources. Only dearth is that we have no clear perspective (indistinct) we are under control. (indistinct) in the only because of our other and therefore we have become confused. So from Buddha's time we wanted there should be no sickness, old age, and death, etc. But it is continuing. There is no such country...",Prabhupāda,"But how do you respect these words of LordBuddha, first thing is."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, I have got one thing, you see, that it is through the diffusion...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. LordBuddha, we have to accept him as an authority, LordBuddha. Now, he gives you idea that no misery. So how do you accept these words of LordBuddha?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, I do not because that was not..., has not come into...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That means he was giving that hint in spiritual life, not in this life."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes. So I wondered that if we can create, when we are free from this and we do not fight on the air. We fight on the things which are scarce. And why there is a scarcity? Because we are not (indistinct) people. Therefore there is a scarcity. If we think on that point and all this is clear, then, when there is no want of life of a material even, then only, every person rises himself from this material...",Prabhupāda,First thing is... May I ask your name?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Bateriya.,Prabhupāda,Batel.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Bateriya.,Prabhupāda,Bateriya. You belong to this province?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, I came from Sindh, Karachi.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, Bateriya. So Mr. Bateriya, this process, this transcendental knowledge, super, superhuman knowledge, you cannot think first of all. You cannot think. You have to learn."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):To realize all these things.,Prabhupāda,Realize after learning from the authority.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Because you see, this question I have asked from 1939... There was a little problem in Karachi. I was very fond of my father. He died when I was only ten. I thought on, ""What is this?"" and all these things. ""Why we are, humanity is suffering all these things?"" It was this question in my mind and what other, I thought of these problems. This appeared as invisible, you see, and material, but to me, inside, it is, you see, a teaching because it was not taught for any individual or for any kind of... It is taught for all men beyond the world so that we can bring that kind of life...",Prabhupāda,"No, you are thinking from your side."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Not from my..., as a particular person but as of the, our own humanity, as a spiritualist.",Prabhupāda,"The spiritual knowledge is calledtatknowledge,tat,oṁtatsat."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Oṁtatsat.Ahaṁbrahmāsmi.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Oṁtatsat.So thetatknowledge is recommended in theBhagavad-gītā,tad-viddhi.Tadviddhipraṇipātena[Bg.4.34].Praṇipātena.You understandpraṇipāta?Surrender."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Surrender.,Prabhupāda,"Sotadviddhi.If you want to understand that transcendental knowledge, then you have to accept this process,praṇipāta.Praṇipātameans surrender, and surrender means there must be somebody to whom you surrender."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Whom you surrender, yes.",Prabhupāda,"There are two, not alone. So you cannot alone think oftatknowledge. You have to surrender to somebody. That is the process."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):There are eight kinds of getting the knowledge, meansbhakti...",Prabhupāda,"No, no.Bhaktiis a process.Bhaktiis not knowledge. That knowledge you acquire by your sense perception, andbhaktiis the pure activities of the senses."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, surrender meansbhakti.One surrenders to...",Prabhupāda,"No question ofbhakti.That is the process. If you want to know abouttat,then that is the process. You have to surrender. So long you will think that ""I can think of, I have got power,"" you'll be failed."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):That consideration of ""myself, I am thinking,"" that is not there.",Prabhupāda,Then who is thinking?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Thinking means...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, don't use abstract knowledge. As soon as you are thinking, you are thinking."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, that sometimes thinking, when you are listening inside you...",Prabhupāda,"Anyway, listening or thinking, these are different process of acquiring knowledge, but you are doing that."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, my outer form is doing that.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But inner form may be...,Prabhupāda,"What is that inner form? You are inner form. Your outer, your coat, is not thinking. Your shirt is not thinking. What you mean by outward, inward? Inward you are. Outward your coat and shirt. Do you think your coat and shirt is thinking? You are thinking."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, I am thinking, but, you see...",Prabhupāda,"There is no ""but."" You are thinking."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I am thinking. One is at the lower level, and one is at the higher...",Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. Either in the lower level or in the higher level, you are thinking."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, all right.",Prabhupāda,"And therefore, because you are thinking in the lower level, therefore your thinking is imperfect. So to be in higher level, you have to surrender to a higher personality."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Higher wouldn't be better than that.,Prabhupāda,"Just like child is thinking something. His thinking is lower level. But when he inquires from his father, that is higher level. The same thinking is he, but one stage his thinking is lower level; in another stage his thinking is higher level. But thinking always, he."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, thinking is his always.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Sotatknowledge is higher level, and therefore you have to accept thattatknowledge from a higher level personality, not from by yourself, because you are in the lower level."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, how do we know lower level and higher level?",Prabhupāda,"Because you do not know, therefore you... Why you are thinking? Because you do not know."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, it is not that...",Prabhupāda,Then there is no question of asking me. Then you think yourself.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, we were trying...",Prabhupāda,First of all you try to understand the principle. Why you have come to ask me?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Not ask but just...,Prabhupāda,Because you are thinking on the lower level.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, no, to configure over it, not to ask or...",Prabhupāda,Why configure? Configure does not mean that you have thought something in lower level; I have to confirm that.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Not even that. We have all...,Prabhupāda,"Then, if you are thinking right, if you are thinking on the higher level, there is no question of coming to me."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):There is no question of coming or going. Just it was that...,Prabhupāda,"Anyway, inquiry."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, no, spiritual endeavor. There is no use in that. It may be in lower level or higher level.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. There is. There is. There is. Higher level, lower level, there is, as soon as there is thinking, feeling, and willing. These are the activities of the mind, and there is higher level, lower level, etc..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):In that we are missing the main twist out of whole thing.,Prabhupāda,"So main twist... But main you are not missing. The point is that if you continue to think on the lower level, then how you can reach to the higher level?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What is the distinction between higher and lower?,Prabhupāda,You do not know? A child is thinking.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, let us think of what is the highest thing.",Prabhupāda,"That you have to learn from the highest man. Yes. That isBhagavad-gītā.Just likeBhagavad-gītāsays thattadviddhi:""You understand that transcendental knowledge by surrender."" So if you do not surrender, there is no possibility."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But I might have surrendered myself to my own...,Prabhupāda,"That is another foolishness. You are thinking lower level, and how you can surrender to yourself? Then how you can get advance? Your surrender means to a superior person, as soon as you call surrender. And without this, there is no possibility."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Many have...,Prabhupāda,"No ""many."" This is the general process."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, general process sometimes have failed.",Prabhupāda,"No, why fail? The schools are going on. Colleges are going on."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Therefore they are fearing also...,Prabhupāda,"Still, they are not closed."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Closed... Today they are coming to that.,Prabhupāda,"That is another theory. But the process is, our Vedic process,tad-vijñānārthamsagurumevaabhigacchet:[MU1.2.12] ""In order to understandtatknowledge one must approach a spiritual master.""Gacchet.If you don't accept these principles, then how you can make progress?Tasmādguruṁprapadyetajijñāsurśreyauttamam[SB11.3.21].If you don't accept this principle, there is no possibility. Then you can go on thinking in your own way. There is no question of going to anyone. You make yourself perfect by thinking, as many others are doing, speculating. That is possible but never to the perfectional point."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Perfectly, you see... What is the category of different perfection?",Prabhupāda,That you have to learn. That you have to learn.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, no, learn from whom?",Prabhupāda,From the higher authority.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):So how we know?,Prabhupāda,"That is another thing, who is higher authority. That you have to search out. That you have to search out."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):We must understand what is higher person and what is lower and whetherBuddhais correct or not.,Prabhupāda,"Now, higher authority... Suppose we acceptKṛṣṇaas the higher authority. Our, thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, we acceptKṛṣṇaas the higher authority."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):It is accepting.,Prabhupāda,"Whatever it may be, we acceptKṛṣṇaas the higher authority. Do you accept that?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I mean, I am shown the form. You see...",Prabhupāda,"There is no question of shown.Kṛṣṇais accepted higher authority not only by us by bigācāryaslike Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, those who are guiding our Vedic life in India,Caitanya. SoKṛṣṇais accepted the highest authority. [break]Kṛṣṇain theBhagavad-gītāsays,mattaḥparataraṁnāsti:""There is no more higher authority than Me."" Then, if you don't acceptKṛṣṇaas the higher authority, that is your business, but we acceptKṛṣṇaas the higher authority."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):So something is coming in that way becauseKṛṣṇa, that was what He had said in a particular time or country...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. Authority means..., it does not mean a time."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, for that time.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. First of all try, try... Authority means..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):For the time.,Prabhupāda,All the time. That is authority.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, but later, later many lights shining...",Prabhupāda,"(knock on door) Yes, open it. Anyway, to make cut short, to make cut short, so far we are concerned, we have declared, ""International Society for Krishna Consciousness."" Our process of propaganda is thatKṛṣṇais the highest authority. That is our... You may take it that we are limited; that is your business. But we have taken this. Now, if you don't acceptKṛṣṇaas the higher authority, then there is no question of inquiring from us."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):What is the form, you see, I mean...",Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇais the form. Here is Kṛṣṇa's form.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, no, not that form.",Prabhupāda,Then what form?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What I mean is we are accepting anything to bring ourselves to certain destination which will satisfy us all. For that we are...,Prabhupāda,Nothing can satisfy everyone. That is not possible. There is no such thing within this material world which can satisfy everyone. There is no such thing.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Because we...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, because... There may be so many ""because."" But the fact is that there is nothing in this material world which can satisfy everyone."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):There can be a method which can...,Prabhupāda,"Maybe, but we do not know."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Therefore beyond that, you see, I came...",Prabhupāda,"Just likeKṛṣṇa. We acceptKṛṣṇathe supreme authority.Kṛṣṇasays,māmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja.Who is accepting this? We have accepted. Some others may have accepted but you have not accepted. So therefore even Kṛṣṇa's injunction is not accepted by everyone, what to speak of others? So therefore you cannot find out within this material world anything which can satisfy everyone. That is not possible."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):We have not found that.,Prabhupāda,"You may think, but we have concluded that there is nothing, such thing, which can satisfy everyone. It is not possible."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Until we hear all, we may do that...",Prabhupāda,"That may be an ideal, but we takeKṛṣṇaas the highest authority. Even Kṛṣṇa's words are not accepted. That's a fact.Kṛṣṇasays, ""You surrender unto Me."" So a few persons might have surrendered to Him. EvenKṛṣṇawas present, only the Pāṇḍavas and the inhabitants of theVṛndāvanaandDvārakā, some of them understood thatKṛṣṇais the Supreme. But many did not accept Him. Many insulted Him. Just like Śiśupāla insulted Him. So evenKṛṣṇacould not be accepted."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Accept, I accept everyone. That is no question of accepting or...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, your... I have summarized that first of all you have come to inquire from us that our standard of knowledge isKṛṣṇa. If you acceptKṛṣṇaas the standard of perfection of knowledge, then there is possibility of our talking. Otherwise simply waste of time. Why shall we waste our time? Our standard isKṛṣṇa. If you are agreeable to accept the standard ofKṛṣṇa, then there is possibility. Just like here is a lawyer. He goes to the lawyer. He speaks, he pleads, on the standard of the lawbooks. If somebody comes, ""No, no, I don't accept this,"" then there is no question of argument. Both the lawyers are arguing. The central point is the lawbook. So you must have a central point on which we shall talk. If you have no central point..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Central point of happiness is there now.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, your point is happiness; my point is happiness. That is all right. But what is that happiness? Just like the same example can be that two litigants, they have gone to the court. Their aim is justice. But how that justice can be had, that is an argument and on the point of law. Similarly, everyone's point is happiness. And what is that standard of happiness, that you have to take from some authority. That authority we accept,Kṛṣṇa. And if you don't acceptKṛṣṇa, then we cannot come to the conclusion what is happiness. So you will simply waste our time. Beginārati.[break] You see? It was... Sometimes the light was coming, sometimes... That means they were adjusting. There was some meeting, adjusting. As soon as it is coming to the real point it was light. And as soon as not in the real point there is no light. So it is a science. Therefore theVedassays,tad-vijñānamIt is avijñāna.It is not a theoretical, whimsical..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):It is to be felt.,Prabhupāda,"Ah... Yes. It is to be learned, just like the electrician learns how to adjust the positive and negative wire, and as soon as it is rightly adjusted there is light. You cannot say, ""No, no, why it shall be adjusted like this? It can be done like this."" Oh, that will not give you light. You cannot speculate on the science. One plus... Two plus two equal to four. You cannot speculate, ""Oh, can it not be three? Cannot be five?"" No, that is not possible. You have to accept this two plus two equal to four. So the same example: so long it was not being adjusted to the right point, there was no light. So this adjustment... Suppose there is failure in my home. For this adjustment I have to call an experienced man. You may be a lawyer, you may be very nice thinker, but so far electricity is concerned, you have to call for amistrī,who may not be learned like you but he knows the art, how to do it, expert. Similarly, such a vast subject to understand God, you do not require the help of an expert?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):I did not take that...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, I don't mean you. Anyone. Anyone. If for ordinary things we have to call for an expert, to understand God is it not necessary to approach an expert? What do you think, Manuel?"
Manuel:,"Manuel:Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"That is... Therefore the Vedas says,tad-vijñānārthaṁ:""In order to know that transcendental science,""sagurumevābhigacchet,""hemustgo to aguru. He must approach."" Agurumeans not bogusguru. One who knows expert. But one has to do that. There is no other alternative. That is the injunction of every Vedicśāstra.And this order is from theKathopaniṣad.Then, on theBhagavad-gītāthe same thing is said,tadviddhipraṇipātena[Bg.4.34].Praṇipātameans surrender. Surrender where? Where to surrender? To a coolie? No, to a superior person,guru. Similarly,Bhāgavatasays,tasmādguruṁprapadyetajijñāsurśreyauttamam:[SB11.3.21] ""One who is inquisitive to understand the spiritual science,""tasmād,""therefore,""guruṁprapadyeta,""must surrender to aguru."" Just our, this morning prayer isguru, beginning of life, beginning of day's work, first worshipingguru. So in our, this Vedic way of life, to acceptguruis essential. Even big, bigācārya...EvenKṛṣṇa, He acceptedguru, SandipaniMuni. LordCaitanyaacceptedguru, ĪśvaraPurī. They are perfect, but still, the ways They are showing because They areācārya.Kṛṣṇais teaching, taking the part of theācārya,so he is also accepting, although the fact is as soon as went to, within a few days He learned everything. That is stated in ourKṛṣṇaBook.Within a few days He became expert warrior, expert magician, expertyogi, every..., so many things, all arts. But He learned from aguru. He is perfect Himself,Kṛṣṇa. He is calledYogesvara. He knows all theyogaprocess, but still, in order to teach us, because He is playing the part of a teacher, He shows us that you must learn fromguru. ""I am learning fromguru."" So any science, you cannot learn it automatically by yourself. No, that is not. Then we shall create so many mental speculators, so many things. That will be not a science. Even all scientists, they accept a formula from an authority: ""law of gravitation."" They accept it. Then their physical, so many things they discover. But accept one formula. Just like this formula is given by Sir Isaac Newton. So they acceptguru. So from all practical point of view, the things which are unknown to us, we have to accept aguru, for things unknown to us. Now, there is another verse.Parābhavas tāvadabodha-jātaḥ.Abodha-jātaḥ.We are all born ignorant. Is it not? What do you think? Are we not born fools? Is it not?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Jñānena...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. I mean to say, take our present position. You were born, I am born, he is born, everyone. Are we not born foolish? What do you think?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):The only sense is cry...,Prabhupāda,"So many ways we do not know. There is some trouble, I am crying, child is crying, and the mother knows that, ""He is suffering. Give..."" Seeking the help of the mother. Then we are going to a school. The father is training, mother is training. Are you not born foolish? In theBhāgavatasays,abodha-jātaḥ:""born foolish."" Everyone is born rascal. So if he does not take help from the authorities how he can make progress? You have become lawyer by sitting at home?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, no, I take tests for many time. I look at books and I take test for one year, twelve, fourteen hours.",Prabhupāda,"That is the process. So how can you deny to understand the supreme science—you can do it independently? No, that is not possible. Therefore it is the verb, the form,gacchet.It is calledvidhilinga.You know Sanskrit? Yes. This form of verb is... Perhaps you also know.Gacchet,kuryat, gadyat.These arevidhilinga. Vidhilingameans that is compulsory. Is it not?"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"He knows Sanskrit very well. Compulsory. Therefore it is said,gacchet-compulsory.Tad-vijñānārtham...Tat,the transcendental knowledge,vijñāna,that is science.Tad-vijñānārthaṁsagurumevaniścayate[MU1.2.12].Evaisniścayate.Evameans certainly. And againgacchet,""must go."" Now, just like to be educated, one must be admitted in a school, must be. Now, what kind of school he has to select, that is another thing, but he must. That's a fact. Similarly, you have to accept aguru. Now, whom you will accept aguru, that is another thing. But you have to do it. That is the injunction of allśāstras.Vedic process is like that. Thisupanayana,the sacred thread,upanayana.Upameans near, andnayanameans bringing.Anayanam,coming or going, like that,nayanam.So ""to go near the spiritual master,""upanayana."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Upanayana-saṁskāra.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And that sacred thread is the certificate that he has accepted a spiritual master. That is our Vedic system, identity, thread, sacred thread. So theupana...Thesaṁskārais calledupanayana-saṁskāra.Upanayanameans he has gone near the spiritual master. Therefore he is nowdvija,second birth. When a person goes to the spiritual master, that is his second birth because he is born foolish. Take birth by the combination of father, mother—that is material birth—that is a birth of ignorance, just like animals. The animals also take their birth in that way. There is no different process, the sex life. So what is the difference between animal and man? Therefore,upanayana,dvija."
Guest:,Guest:Janmanājāyateśūdraḥ.,Prabhupāda,Janmanājāyateśūdraḥsaṁskārad bhaveddvijaḥ.Unfortunately there is nosaṁskāraat the present moment. So therefore they remainśūdra.Aśūdrameans fourth-class. So how a fourth-class man can speculate on the science of God?
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Butśūdrasare not allowed toupanayana-saṁskāra.,Prabhupāda,"No. No, no, no. Now, don't take that way. One who does not takesaṁskāra,he isśūdra,becausejanmanājāyateśūdraḥ.Everyone is bornśūdra.But if one does not accept thesaṁskāras,he remains aśūdra,not thatśūdrasare not allowed to takesaṁskāra.Then how it is, thatjanmanājāyateśūdraḥ?"
Guest (4):,Guest (4):(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"There are many instances. But this very word, ""by birth one isśūdra,""so there is no discrimination that ""You are notśūdra.I am not...,"" by birth,abodha-jāto,because he is born foolish rascal. Now, bysaṁskāra,by culture, by education, he becomesdvija,second birth. The practical example is these European and American students. They were doing all nonsense but since they have come togurutheir life is reformed; therefore they aredvija. Saṁskārad bhaveddvijaḥ,veda-paṭhet...Now, when he becomesdvija,then he is allowed to studyVedas,not as aśūdra.When we sayśūdrahas no right to studyVedas,that means he will not be able to understand. Just like you became lawyer, but the condition is, unless you become graduate, unless you have graduated yourself, you cannot enter law college. That does not mean law is prohibited for anyone. It is open for everyone, but first of all you make yourself university graduate; then enter law. Similarly, everyone isśūdra."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):A particular standard of understanding should be qualified.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So unless he has gotsaṁskāra,he is enlightened by culture and knowledge, unless he has becomedvija,then there is no authority for studyingVedas.Veda-paṭhet.After one has becomedvija,then he is allowed to studyVedas.Janmanājāyateśūdraḥsaṁskārad bhaveddvijaḥ,andveda-paṭhed bhavedvipraḥ.Vipra.Then he becomes... Gradually increasing, fromśūdrahe comes todvija,thenvipra.And after beingvipra,after studying all theVedas,when he realizesBrahman, then he isbrāhmaṇa.Brahmājānātītibrāhmaṇaḥ.So thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is that, gradual process, gradual process and to make him a qualifiedbrāhmaṇa.And when he becomesbrāhmaṇa,then he knowsBrahman. Then he makes spiritual progress. Without... Therefore, without becomingbrāhmaṇanobody can make spiritual progress. That is the door of spiritual knowledge. Then he makes progress, makes progress. So after understandingBrahmanknowledge, then he comes toParamātmāknowledge, then he comes toBhāgavataknowledge."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Vedasays, (Sanskrit)",Prabhupāda,"Yes.Bala-mūrti-tejaḥ.So this is the scientific process. It isvijñāna.Tad-vijñānam.And in the Seventh Chapter inBhagavad-gītāit is stated,jñānaṁvijñāna-sahitaṁ.Jñānaṁvijñāna-sahitaṁ.It isvijñāna.It is science."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Jñānameans knowledge.,Prabhupāda,"No, no.Vijñānais practical application."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):When you applyjñānaand...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That isvijñāna.Sojñānaknowledge, first knowledge, is what is God, what is God and what is my relation with Him. This is knowledge. Then you... When you act according to that knowledge, that isvijñāna.That isbhakti.When you understand fully well that ""God is great, and I am a small minute part and parcels of God,"" and then you understand that the part and parcel's duty is to serve the whole... Is it not? Just like the finger is part and parcel of my body. Its duty is to serve the whole body. Similarly, if we accept, if we understand, that ""I am part and parcel of God; then my duty is to serve God."" But people are being misled that he is thinking God himself. Although he is under so many restrictions and stricture of the material nature.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāṇiguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ,ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā[Bg.3.27].He is so foolish and rascal that he is thinking, ""I am independent.""Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmākartaahamitimanyate.He is strictly under the stringent laws of material nature, but still, he is thinking falsely that ""I am supreme. I am independent."" So therefore surrender required, that ""I am not supreme."" That is knowledge. That is knowledge in theBhagavad-gītā.Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁprapadyate:[Bg.7.19] ""After many, many births of this speculation, when actually he becomesjñānavān,wise, then he surrenders.""Vāsudevaḥsarvamitisamahātmāsu-durlabhaḥ[Bg.7.19].So unless we surrender, so long we think that ""I am independent, I am God, I am Supreme,"" these are all illusions. What do you think?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"It is illusion, simply illusion. If I am God, how I have become so much dependent on the laws of material nature? Why I have accepted this body which I do not want? What kind of God I am? So the whole world is full of these ideas. So this movement is a revolutionary movement,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Guest (5):,Guest (5):(Hindi) What is the meaning of God.,Prabhupāda,"He does not... He does not know what is meaning of God. He thinks that God is something plaything. Therefore he claimed that ""I am God."" He does not know what is God. Therefore God personally showing—He's coming,Kṛṣṇa: ""What is God, see."" God is from very beginning God.Kṛṣṇa, from the birth He is God. He hasn't got to meditate. He hasn't got to go to the forest and..., to become God. He is God."
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):God is made for, sir.",Prabhupāda,"Not ""God is made."" God is never made. God is God."
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):But, sir, G means (Hindi?)",Prabhupāda,"That is your speculation. G means this, O means this, this means this. That you can interpret in so many ways but God is God. God is great.Brahman.Brahmanmeans great, Parabrahman, the greatest.Paraṁbrahmaparaṁdhāmapavitraṁparamaṁbhavān[Bg.10.12].That isKṛṣṇa. Is it not stated in theBhagavad-gītā?"
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Before the birth of LordKṛṣṇa, was God existing? God exhibit temporally...",Prabhupāda,"Therefore you have to learn what is the birth ofKṛṣṇa. You do not know.Janmakarmamedivyamyojānātitattvataḥ[Bg.4.9].You do not know what is the birth. You are thinking that He is, like ordinary man He has taken birth. Otherwise why does He say,janmakarmamedivyamyojānātitattvataḥ?Nobody knows what is His birth? He thinks He's... Just like a child sees daily that the sun rises from the eastern side—therefore eastern side is the father of sun. Is eastern side father of the sun? Sun is always there, but you see in the morning it is appearing from the eastern side. That's all. It is your angle of vision, not that sun is born, taking birth from the eastern side. Sun is always there in the sky. Similarly,Kṛṣṇais always there but to the foolish person it appears that He is born.Ajo 'pi sann avyayātmā. Ajo 'pi:""I have no birth.""Ajaḥ.This very word is used.Ajo 'pi sann avyayātmābhūtānāmīśvaro 'pisan.So how you can compare Kṛṣṇa's birth like ordinary birth? If anyone knows what is Kṛṣṇa's birth he becomes liberated.Janmakarmamedivyamyojānātitattvataḥ.So that knowledge is nottattvataḥknowledge, that Kṛṣṇa's birth. Kṛṣṇa's birth is every moment. Just like sun. Now here it is not sunshine but in another place the sunshine is rising. So is that the birth, or when the sun will rise here, that will be birth? Which will be the birth of sun?"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):It will always be there.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. It is already there but when you see, you see, you see that it is birth. The sunrise is already somewhere, and the sunset is also already somewhere but in your angle of vision there is no sun. That is going on. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa's birth, every moment; Kṛṣṇa's disappearance, every moment; Kṛṣṇa's existence, every moment. You have to learn that. ThereforeKṛṣṇasaid,janmakarmamedivyam[Bg.4.9],transcendental.Yojanatitattvataḥ.Anyone who knows it perfectly, in truth, he becomes liberated. If you have knownKṛṣṇa, then you are liberated. ButKṛṣṇaknowing is not so easy.Manuṣyāṇāṁsahasreṣukaścidyatatisiddhayeyatatāmapisiddhānāṁkaścidvettimāṁtattvataḥ[Bg.7.3].It is very difficult to understandKṛṣṇain truth. Then how one can understand? That is also stated:bhaktyāmāmabhijānātiyāvānyaś cāsmitattvataḥ[Bg.18.55].Not by speculation of knowledge.Bhaktya.And what is thatbhakti? Anyābhilaṣita-śunyaṁjñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam,ānukūlyenakṛṣṇānuśīlānaṁ bhaktiruttama[Cc.Madhya19.167][Brs.1.1.11].So these things you have to learn. Then there is possibility of knowledge,tad-vijñāna.The difficulty is at the present moment the theory that everyone can invent his way of understanding God. He can speculate. Therefore there is chaos. There is chaos. If you want to save yourself from this chaotic condition of life youmusttake toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is our proposal. Give me that knife.HareKṛṣṇa. Not so many. Begin.Aiye.[break] ...friend ofKṛṣṇa. How much exalted he is, a great warrior, and he has the right to talk withKṛṣṇaon equal level. Still, he acceptedKṛṣṇaas spiritual master. And he said, ""The confusion which I have created, it is not possible for me to clear it. It is You only who can clear, I know. Therefore I accept You as spiritual master."" Therefore it is required that one should know who can clear your confusion, and there you must surrender. (aside:) Anyone? Everyone. Come on. Not in the left hand. Don't give anything by left hand; don't take anything. That is a etiquette.HareKṛṣṇa. Yes. Yes."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I'll look on here this morning.(?),Prabhupāda,"That's all right. Oh, you haven't got. You have got?HareKṛṣṇa. (birds crying) The sunrise is declared. ""Koo koo koo koo koo."" Yes. Nature's way. They'll not sleep any more. Therefore anyone who sleeps after sunrise, he is a rascal. He's a rascal. Yes. A child at once, early in the morning, rise. That is nature. But we have created such a life that we have to break all the nature laws and therefore we suffer.Daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyāduratyayā,māmevayeprapadyante[Bg.7.14].And one who has surrendered toKṛṣṇa, he is free. He is rising early. He has surpassed themāyā.And those who are inmāyāthey are sleeping. And those who are not inmāyāthey are rising early in the morning. Is it not?Māmevayeprapadyante:""Anyone who surrenders unto Me, he becomes free from themāyā'scontamination."" Just see. There ismaṅgalaārati.InVṛndāvanajust at four o'clock. You have heard?"
Yamunā,"I was just thinking, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"Immediately there is ""dung, dung, dung, dung,"" all temples. Immediately. And people are running. Oh, they will gather all to the Deity, temple. Hundreds of people will go automatically. The same man who was living at home, a very degraded condition, as soon as he goes toVṛndāvanahe becomes habituated to all these things automatically. Automatically. Yes. The society, association, is very important."
Yamunā,"Those beautiful birds, the peacock birds also at this time, they are flying in trees and waking up now and make that sound. Oh,Vṛndāvana.",Prabhupāda,"So the society is very important thing. Any, anything, society... The businessmen, they have got their association, society, to improve. Therefore the standard of this International Society should be kept very carefully. Then who will come in touch with this society will be improved automatically by association. All right. Even in the bird society there are swans and there are crows, by nature, and the crows will never go to the swans, and the swans will never come to the crows. ""Birds of the same feather flock together."" Yes. Therefore society required. Unless you come to theKṛṣṇaconsciousness society, how you can developKṛṣṇaconsciousness? The same principle.Satāṁprasaṅgān...Satāṁprasaṅgānmamavīrya-saṁvidobhavantihṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥkathaḥ[SB3.25.25].Vīrya-saṁvidaḥ.It becomes very palatable,satāṁprasaṅgāt,in the association of devotees, not otherwise.

Anyone who manufactures his own process of religion, that is rascaldom.dharmāṁtusakṣādbhagavat-praṇitam[SB6.3.19].Just like lawyer, representative of the law, means who carries the order of the supreme executive. He is lawyer. Similarly, a spiritual master means who carries the order of superior authority.

Guest (1):,Guest (1):But you have to understand the relation between the two.,Prabhupāda,"That's all... That we understand very nicely. It is not that I have to learn from you. We know it very well. But you should know that we are preachingBhagavad-gītā.So thisjyotir-liṅga,all these theories, they are not in theBhagavad-gītā.It may be in other literature, but we are particularly interested in preachingBhagavad-gītā.BecauseBhagavad-gītāis wrongly preached all over the world by nonsense commentation, we want to rectify it. Therefore our society is specially named ""Krishna conscious."""
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What is wrongly preached aboutGītā?,Prabhupāda,Wrong... Just like yesterday I went thatGītāSamītī.There is a lamp. Why there is a lamp instead ofKṛṣṇa? Why there is a lamp?Kṛṣṇais a lamp? And it isBhagavad...
Guest (1):,Guest (1):I don't know...,Prabhupāda,You do not know. Therefore I say this is wrongly preaching. Why in the place ofKṛṣṇathere is a lamp? DoesKṛṣṇasay?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Lamp has been with us for more than... In ourmandira...,Prabhupāda,That's all right. (Hindi?)Kṛṣṇais also there.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):They must evolve with that idea because...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. First thing is that when we speak ofBhagavad-gītā,it is spoken byKṛṣṇa. So why there is noKṛṣṇaphotograph?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):They didn't put the picture.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That means you have not understoodKṛṣṇa. Therefore your, this so-calledGītāsociety is not bona fide. At least even in ordinary feature, suppose if there is political meeting, you keepGandhi, thisphoto, Jawaharlal Nehru'sphotobecause they are the political leaders. You are preachingBhagavad-gītā,GītāSamītī,and there is not a single picture ofKṛṣṇa."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):There is little misunderstanding, thatGītāJayantīis for...",Prabhupāda,"No, first of all answer me this question. Then you go toGītāJayantī.That, yourSamītīisGītāSamītīand there is not a single picture ofKṛṣṇa. Yes."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):We don't know about that one.,Prabhupāda,You were not there present? Oh. That's not... I think you were present.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):(indistinct),Prabhupāda,This is misguided.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I never gone there, never been there.",Prabhupāda,"This is misguided. That's all. Now,""GītāBhavan,""and they have invited me because we are teachingBhagavad-gītā,and that wasGītā's Jayantī—and the speaker ofGītāis not present? Therefore I say that there are so many places, here also. They are wrongly representingBhagavad-gītā.So our position is to rectify that wrong propaganda ofBhagavad-gītā."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):What is that wrong propaganda?,Prabhupāda,"That is one of the instance. There are many instances, many instances, many instances. Just like Dr. Radhakrishnan. In the Ninth Chapter there is verse,man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65].Radhakrishnan says, ""It is not to the personKṛṣṇa."" Where he gets this nonsense idea?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, that Vivekananda also has said.",Prabhupāda,"They are all nonsense! Therefore I say they are all nonsense, who deviates from the original text of theBhagavad-gītā."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Swamiji, by declaring other interpretation as nonsense...",Prabhupāda,"Yes! You cannot interpret! First of all if you cannot interpret. First of all my proposal, that you cannot interpret."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):We'll come to that, that you are not interpreting correctly, does not make me correct. I must be correct also to...",Prabhupāda,"I am correct so long I present the correct thing, so long I am... If I presentKṛṣṇaas it is, then I am correct."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):My solution, Swamiji, most respectfully, is how do you judge that ""I am correct""?",Prabhupāda,"Because I am presenting whatKṛṣṇasays. First of all you answer this: what is correct, the standard of correctness? You cannot create correctness. WhenKṛṣṇasays this,man-manābhavamad-bhaktaḥ:""You just surrender unto Me; become Mybhakta,""how you can say, ""It is not toKṛṣṇa."" This is not nonsense? If I say, ""Give me a glass of..."" Hear me. If I say, ""Give me a glass of water,"" if you say, ""It is not to Swamiji,"" is that interpretation?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I do not, and again I say...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, first of all you answer me. If I say, ""Give me a glass of water,"" and you say, ""It is not to Swamiji."""
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):(indistinct) ...what the Christ says, Mohammed says, everyone says, that...",Prabhupāda,Let them surrender to Christ. But why don't you surrender toKṛṣṇa?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, that is true, but...",Prabhupāda,"That is true, but you do not know how."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, you see, our... Even your... Even your way of thinking and your purpose is that LordKṛṣṇashould be Lord of the whole universe, so...,",Prabhupāda,"Yes, LordKṛṣṇais lord, universe."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Universe?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):So that is what you want to talk with me.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):In that case, you will have to satisfy everybody.",Prabhupāda,"I am satisfying everybody. I am preaching that. But it is not possible... I am preaching in Europe. Christians, Mohammedans, Jews, they are surrendering toKṛṣṇa. So I am doing my duty."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):If I would be permitted, I would very humbly submit that...",Prabhupāda,"You may not. You have not to surrender, you may bring some argument, but where I am preaching, they are surrendering."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):You are doing a very wonderful work, there is no doubt about it, but the thing is that...",Prabhupāda,But you do not like that wonderful work.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):...judging duty of what we are doing, this is somebody else and not we ourself.",Prabhupāda,Now... What you... My point is that our society is clearly giving you the indication that we are preachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Every society has taken...,Prabhupāda,"So that's all right. If you like thisKṛṣṇaphilosophy, you are welcome. Otherwise you leave."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):We have come here...,Prabhupāda,Because first of all see that you are...
Guest (1):,Guest (1):If you reject...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. Don't talk, all together. First of all you must know what is the truth. If your standard of truth is different and my standard of truth is different, then where is the use of talking nonsense? If you have any other truth thanKṛṣṇa, you be satisfied."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Seeking knowledge...,Prabhupāda,Seeking God is sufficient. If you take... First of all you know my position. Suppose...
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I understand your position and I have from the beginning said most respectfully. I beg to submit and what my submission is that, as a seeker of knowledge, I come to you. Now...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, that... Do you know what is the process of seeking knowledge? Do you know that?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):No.,Prabhupāda,"No, first of all answer me. You are seeking knowledge..."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):The thing is...,Prabhupāda,"No, you also hear me. First of all let me know what is the process of seeking knowledge. You cannot make your own process."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):The concepts have changed. You are making a change from the...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. First of all you know that I am speaking fromBhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītāsays,tadviddhipraṇipātena[Bg.4.34].Is it not?Tadviddhipraṇipātena.You have to surrender first of all."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Surrender to whom?,Prabhupāda,Anyone wherefrom you are seeking knowledge.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):You lose your identity.,Prabhupāda,Yes. First of all you have to find out a person where you can surrender. Then you can ask and you can seek knowledge. Otherwise there is no... Simply waste of time. Why should you waste your time? Why shall I waste my time? Are you surrendered to me? If you are not surrendered to me...
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I, I...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Stop this. Just try to understand. If you are not surrendered to me you have no right to ask me anything."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Before one surrenders to somebody, he should be satisfied first with the questions...",Prabhupāda,"Therefore... Yes. So that, that... Now that satisfaction, I cannot satisfy for your whims."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):It is not a whim...,Prabhupāda,"Now, one thing is that I am preachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness. If you talk onKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then you can ask me."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yesterday you said in our nice gathering, I remember, that we have to rise above body consciousness.",Prabhupāda,Yes. That is in theGītā.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):And we have to be soul conscious.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Now, that is one thing that is there in all scriptures. TheGītāalso says thatkāma,krodha,lobha,moha,ahaṅkāramust be checked. Now, if we move with that pride and arrogance that ""We are the only correct calling. This is the only correct path,"" and that ""You have to surrender from the beginning,"" now that only aggravates the pride in a person.",Prabhupāda,"Then what can I do?Kṛṣṇasays... If you talk, two, I cannot answer. You talk with me, one."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, we have talked with reasoning.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Don't talk, two. I cannot answer with all these reasons. Either you talk or then let him talk."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I am talking. I am talking now.,Prabhupāda,Then you talk. Let him talk.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):So we have to tear all these vices that are connected with our body. That is our purpose of getting into eitherbhakti,ornāma,bhāgavataor whatever it may be.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):But in that way, if you talk from that, another way ofahaṅkāraand pride, then things cannot go far. Things cannot go far.",Prabhupāda,"So shall I answer now? Now you stop; I answer. NowKṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66],ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi.So even though you have got so many sinful life,Kṛṣṇaassures that ""If you surrender unto Me I shall give you protection from the reaction."""
Guest (2):,Guest (2):That is another thing.Kṛṣṇa...,Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇa...Kṛṣṇa, yes.Kṛṣṇa."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Surrender toKṛṣṇa, not surrender to all who...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. Surrender toKṛṣṇa. We are saying not ""Surrender unto me."" We say, always saying, ""Surrender toKṛṣṇa."" Therefore the same word. I am not saying that ""I have becomeKṛṣṇa. I have become God. You surrender to me."" We are preaching, ""Surrender toKṛṣṇa."" That isKṛṣṇaconscious. So we are not speaking differently fromKṛṣṇa. You try to understand. We are saying... Suppose if I say, ""Give me a glass of water,"" and if you say, ""Oh, give Swamiji immediately a glass of ...,"" the same thing."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Kṛṣṇaalso says inGītāthat...,Prabhupāda,"No, first of all you try to understand this, thatKṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁ:[Bg.18.66] ""only unto Me."""
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):""I am the only one.""Sarva-dharmān...",Prabhupāda,"Again you are speaking. I am talking with him. Again you are speaking. No, no. I cannot answer in that way. Let him talk. No, no. You stopped me. Let him talk. Otherwise it is not possible. You put some question; he puts some question. It is not possible. NowKṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].Now what do you say? He is very proud?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):He's entitled to be proud. If a person has said that...,Prabhupāda,Yes?
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Let him say that, but it doesn't mean everybody will be able to follow. That doesn't mean that. Maybe He has said.",Prabhupāda,"But then He doesn't say. You say, ""If you follow me."" Now it is your discretion to follow Him or not to follow Him.Kṛṣṇasaid this toArjuna. That does not mean everyone of the world, likeArjuna, surrenders toKṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Anyone, if he says, evenKṛṣṇa, or God, says, it is not that everyone follows that. That independence you have got. But our philosophy is thatKṛṣṇasays, ""You surrender unto Me,"" and we are imploring, we are begging persons, that ""You please surrender toKṛṣṇa."" Now it isyourdiscretion. Whether you surrender toKṛṣṇaor Lord Śiva, that is your discretion. But our preaching method is we are trying to preach in the world, ""Please surrender toKṛṣṇa."" That is our position."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Sir, can I speak now?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):With your permission, I believe inGītā.I believe in this thing, that it is the Lord who says:",Prabhupāda,Then you find...
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Kṛṣṇawas body incarnate.,Prabhupāda,Then you mean to say thatKṛṣṇacontradicts.
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):No, notKṛṣṇacontradicts.",Prabhupāda,Then why you bring this question?
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):TheGītā,theGītāis... Sir, if I may be permitted to continue?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Gītājñānaitself is given by Lord incorporeal, not toKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇa, it is told, at the time thejñānawas given had a body which becamedivyaVedānta(?).",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is your interpretation."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):That is exactly what...,Prabhupāda,"No, you say. Anyone who... Anyone... Whatever he says, he thinks like that, exact. That is another thing. But we know thatKṛṣṇahad no difference between His body and soul. He is absolute. Now, you are talking from the point of view that Kṛṣṇa's body and Kṛṣṇa's soul is different."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Ah, no... In every body...",Prabhupāda,That is not the fact. That is not the fact.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Sir,Kṛṣṇacould not the two...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, you say, ""could not,"" but we do not say like that. Now who will settle up this thing? You say, but I do not say."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):If you say, ""This is not the body...""",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. We are to speak on theBhagavad-gītā.We are talking ofBhagavad-gītā.Kṛṣṇasays thatmāmekam.He never says that ""to My soul."""
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):No. He says, ""I am one.""",Prabhupāda,"Therefore He is one, both body and soul, one. That is one."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Swamiji, material aspect in your understanding, they are one?",Prabhupāda,"Therefore He is nonmaterial. Therefore He has spoken... No, no, if you compare with Him ordinary man, then at once you become amūḍha.Avajānantimāṁmūḍhā.No, you say... This is the saying ofBhagavad-gītā.Avajānantimāṁmūḍhāmanuṣīṁtanumāśritaḥ[Bg.9.11].(Hindi) ""Because I have taken this human form of life, the rascals, they think I am a human being."" It is said in theBhagavad-gītā."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I think... As my understanding of this aspect is concerned, He says, ""When I adopt this medium through which I give thisjñāna,mūḍhā-matīdo not understand Me.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now,mūḍhā-matī,how to understand?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):""Cannot recognize Me.""",Prabhupāda,"Suppose I ammūḍhā-matī,so how I am to understand?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Yes, butKṛṣṇaas a body form could be seen and could be recognized by people as such. So there was no question of not understanding him.",Prabhupāda,Thing is that whatever I have understood aboutKṛṣṇaI haven't got to learn from you.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, you don't have to learn from me.",Prabhupāda,Thank you.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):But what you have to learn...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, I am not speaking my own views. I have got myācāryas,my teachers, Rāmānujācārya, Śaṅkarācārya, Madhvācārya. So it is all right. It is all right. I have got so many authorities. What authority you have got?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I am, myself, in my own senses...",Prabhupāda,"Now, you are not authority."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I am not but my own...,Prabhupāda,I am following so many authorities. Then... Then there is no question.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I am only...,Prabhupāda,"You are yourself authority. Now, if you say my views are not correct, I may be incorrect but I am following the predecessor. I am taking..."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):What is the difference there? Sir, I accept that.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Hundred per cent, you are very correct in saying what you have just said.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I want to understand that point of view. That is why I have come.,Prabhupāda,"But this is the point of understanding. That I have already told you, in theBhagavad-gītā,that if you want to understand, first of all you have to surrender."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Surrender to whom? Not to theācāryasbut to the...,Prabhupāda,"First of all find out whom to surrender, then talk."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):...supremeācārya,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. If you think that you are not fit for my surrender, that's all right. But first of all you find out somebody where you can surrender; then talk."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Tojñāna-dattaHimself.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that's all right. If you surrender and if you getjñāna-datta,that is all right. So far we are concerned, if we do not surrender, if you do not surrender, then you simply waste our time, idle talk. This is not the process."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):For seeking knowledge from him.,Prabhupāda,But you are not seeking knowledge. You have come to challenge it. You have come to challenge.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, no, no... (several Indian men talk at once)",Prabhupāda,"Now, you are saying thatKṛṣṇasays that incorporeal. ButKṛṣṇasays that ""Anyone who thinks that I am incorporeal, that he is a fool."""
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Quite right. LordKṛṣṇaas such, if anybody calls Him incorporeal, he's a fool.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Because He has a body, He has taken birth fromDevaki. And incorporeal does not...",Prabhupāda,"Therefore theKṛṣṇasays that one has to understand that what is Kṛṣṇa's birth.Janmakarmamedivyamyojānātitattvataḥ.So thattattvataḥis notyo.Anyone who knowsKṛṣṇaactually, he becomes immediately liberated.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmetikaunteya[Bg.4.9].Anyone simply who understandsKṛṣṇa, he becomes immediately liberated. If you understoodKṛṣṇacorrectly, then you are liberated person. You have nothing to ask from me."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):It is what...,Prabhupāda,"No, that's all. Then you are liberated person. You have nothing to ask from me. I am for those who are conditioned, but you are liberated, so you have nothing to ask from me."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Rest of us, we persons, go.",Prabhupāda,"Then you are liberated; you have nothing to go. If you are liberated, then you have nothing to seek, knowledge."
Guest (5):,Guest (5):Thank you for listening. Time and place. He's already said that.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. If you are liberated, you have nothing to go anywhere because you know everything."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):May I again submit with the honor that you have bestowed on me of having said that I am already liberated according to the version ofGītā...,Prabhupāda,"If you have understoodKṛṣṇa, then you are liberated."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I still feel... I still feel...,Prabhupāda,Then you haven't got to seek knowledge.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I still feel that...,Prabhupāda,You be satisfied with yourself. You are liberated.
Guest (5):,Guest (5):That means those who are to follow you are not liberated.,Prabhupāda,"I am not follow... Er, I don't say, ""Follow me."" I say, ""FollowKṛṣṇa."" Why...? Don't mistake that. I say... My vision is thatKṛṣṇasays, ""Surrender unto Me."" I say, ""You and everyone, surrender toKṛṣṇa."""
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):That you make wherever you are spreading, not...",Prabhupāda,"Well, that is my business. Where I am spreading or not, that is my business. But I am saying this, thatKṛṣṇasays you surrender untoKṛṣṇa, ""Surrender unto Me."" I say, ""Surrender untoKṛṣṇa."" Is there any difference?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"Is it not according toGītā?Is it not according toGītā?If I say, ""Surrender unto Kṛṣṇa""..."
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):...if each and every person has an individual identity of (indistinct) soul above the body consciousness and unless you treat him as equal, there is little...",Prabhupāda,"No, nobody... You cannot say... Even though they are equal, you can see equal but they are not equal. They are not equal. There are threeguṇas,and in theBhagavad-gītāthat is analyzed, that ""These persons are in thesattva-guṇa,these persons are in therajo-guṇa,these persons are in..."""
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):That is not personality of theātmā,but theātmāis everybody's soul.",Prabhupāda,That's all... First of all we have...
Guest (5):,Guest (5):If you have potency to rise and go higher and higher...,Prabhupāda,You are not on theātmāstage; I am not in theātmāstage. You are in the bodily stage.
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):Both, body and soul, together...",Prabhupāda,"Then if you are in theātmāstage, then you have no argument with me.Paṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18]."
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):But argument, you have admitted that...",Prabhupāda,"No, there is no argument. That will stop.Brahma-bhūtaḥprasannātmānaśocatinakāṅkṣati[Bg.18.54]."
Guest (5):,Guest (5):It is on arguments get down...,Prabhupāda,"No. If you are... Just see. This is stated in theBhagavad-gita,that:"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):That is the correct position.,Prabhupāda,"That is correct position. But if you find that ""Swamiji is not on the standard,"" that means you are not in the posit...,sama-darśinaḥeven."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):You mean if a person commits a murder, a sinner...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is very high stage. That is very high stage,sama-darśinaḥ."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):No, no. If a person commits a murder, you are seeing...",Prabhupāda,"So why you see, you are seeing, ""Commits murder?"" Why don't you see that it isKṛṣṇais acting there? Why you say that ""commits murder?"""
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Kṛṣṇais getting the sin committed.,Prabhupāda,Sama-darśinaḥmeans you have no distinction what is sin and what is...
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Sama-darśinaḥmeans to treat everyone as equal.,Prabhupāda,"No, no, no.Samadarśinaḥmeans there is no distinction between sin and virtue. That issama-darśinaḥ.As soon as you see, ""This is virtue, and this is sin,"" it is notsama-darśinaḥ."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Virtue and sin become the same insama-darśinaḥ.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That issama-darśinaḥ.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):In other words, the sin does not remain sin any longer.",Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. But he has no vision that ""This is sin, and this is virtue."" That issama-darśinaḥ.As soon as you make distinction, you are notsama-darśinaḥ."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):In another interpretation, in...",Prabhupāda,"You may interpret in a different.Sama-darśi,this is plain word.Sama-darśimeans there is no difference, that's all."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Butsama-darśiequalssama-darśi.The sin and virtue are the same.,Prabhupāda,"No, here... Yes, that issama-darśinaḥbecause here it is said clearly,vidyā-vinaya-sampannebrāhmaṇa[Bg.5.18].Abrāhmaṇa,learnedbrāhmaṇa,andvinaya,very humble... That is the sign of goodness.Vidyā-vinaya-sampannegavihastiniśunica. Śunicameans dog. Now he is seeing a dog and a learnedbrāhmaṇa-same. Now, dog is supposed to be sinful, and this learnedbrāhmaṇais supposed to be virtuous. Therefore his vision, the virtuous and the sinful, the same. That issama-darśi."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):I think that they have made a many mistakes in writing of theślokas.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. Now you are finding mistake withVyāsa, so who can talk with you?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, but, but...",Prabhupāda,Please excuse me. Please go out. Please go out. Don't trouble. You are finding faults withVyāsa.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):We only want you to be understood here.,Prabhupāda,"(shouting) I am notsama-darśi!I don't say I'msama-darśi!I don't say,sama-darśi.So you saysama-darśi.Sama-darśi."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):You should besama-darśi.,Prabhupāda,"But I am not in that stage. I say because you don't surrender toKṛṣṇa, you are sinful. That is mydarśana."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):So then you should be also seeing assama-darśinaḥ.,Prabhupāda,"No, why shall I? I am not in that position. I am not within that... I am simply repeating the words ofKṛṣṇa."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Then that... You came to... Even your... (?),Prabhupāda,"I am simply teaching the teachings ofKṛṣṇa. That is my point. I may besama-darśi,I may be notsama-darśi."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Not be, but you teach that we should worship thesama-darśi.",Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇasays. I don't say.
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Ah! You say,Kṛṣṇasays that...",Prabhupāda,But that does not mean that one has becomesama-darśinaḥ.That is... That is his...
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Then he is not following theguru.,Prabhupāda,No. My position is simply repeating. That's all. My position is.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):So we want understanding more than mere tape recorder.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you may be tape... But that is my position because I have been authorized in that way, that ""Anyone who preaches this confidential subject matter, he is My dear."" So I have nothing to learn, what issama-darśi.I have my position..."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):No, blind following and open-eyed following, I say it is all right. We can read the book. We can read the verses, translation, Hindi translation. But that is not understanding.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is not understanding, I understand. But I am understanding from my teacher, just like I told you, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya,ViṣṇuSvāmī, LordCaitanya. There are so many stalwart teachers, practically wholeHinducommunity."
Guest (6):,"Guest (6):But every successive teacher has added some interpretations of the knowledge, no?",Prabhupāda,First of all let him be successor.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):You are the successor of somebody.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Yes. So you want to act something to get knowledge.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (6):,Guest (6):You are teaching others to besama-darśi...,Prabhupāda,Mysama-darśiis that why only the Hindus shall knowKṛṣṇa? The world should knowKṛṣṇa.
Guest (6):,Guest (6):World should know also.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
