Girl Devotee:,Girl Devotee:...lotus flower.,Prabhupāda,All right. [break] They cannot enjoy. We are enjoying. Is it not?
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,They are sleeping. They are thinking they are enjoying.
Brahmānanda,One has to know what is enjoyment.,Prabhupāda,"No, whatever it may be. We are utilizing it because we are fortunate. [break] ...explaining last night that earth, water, air, fire, they have come from Kṛṣṇa's energy. Can you explain how it has come? Any one of you. People may say that ""You can say like that, but prove that the earth has come fromKṛṣṇa."""
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):You said last night... You mentioned a verse from theBhagavad-gītā,ahaṁsarvasyaprabhavo[Bg.10.8],thatKṛṣṇais the source of everything.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. That is... Your scripture says, but I am a third person. Why shall I believe in your scripture? You prove. You are quoting from your own scripture. I don't take your scripture. You give me practical explanation how earth has come fromKṛṣṇa."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Well, one has to accept the scriptures.",Prabhupāda,So that you may accept.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):This is whatKṛṣṇahas left here five thousand years ago.,Prabhupāda,"""That's all right. It doesn't matter. That doesn't matter."""
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):...for your benefit, for everyone because you are part ofKṛṣṇatoo.",Prabhupāda,That is your saying. You prove that.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):That's not my saying. That's the Supreme Lord's saying.,Prabhupāda,That's all right.
Indian man or Devotee (2):,Indian man or Devotee (2):Like a child has to accept the authority of her mother to know about our father.,Prabhupāda,"That is all right, but you give some practical explanation that how earth has come from..."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):The only practical explanation we can have or any living entity has is that explanation which his father gives him, the Supreme Lord gives him. He has given us...",Prabhupāda,That is all right.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):...explanation in theBhagavad-gītā.,Prabhupāda,"Still,vijñānameansjñānaandviveka.Vivekameans personal conviction. That is calledvijñāna.Jñānaandvijñāna.One knowledge you get from me, and then you practically apply your consciousness that ""Yes, what Prabhupāda has said, it is right."" That is calledvijñāna.One knowledge, accepting blindly from the authority, that is knowledge. But how it is practically made or done, that understanding is calledvijñāna."
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):We have so many examples of...,Prabhupāda,Give that example. That I wanted.
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):We have so many examples of scientific creations by intelligent brain, personalities on this planet, so many things which we can see, like the clothes we wear and the machines we are using in our everyday lives which require...",Prabhupāda,So howKṛṣṇahas prepared earth? That I want.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):So we can see by studying the nature of the construction of this earth that it is much more intelligent...,Prabhupāda,So how earth is coming fromKṛṣṇa? Tell me that.
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):The scientists say that this earth came from gases, but they cannot explain exactly where those gases have come from. That source, that isKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,"No, they do not know, but we know. How in your belly gas is formed? How? There was no gas, but automatically the gas is formed. And therefore sometimes, if it is much gas, then you go for treatment. So this is the practical. The gas is also generating from my body. So as I am an individual, insignificant body, if there is possibility of generating little gas, so Kṛṣṇa's gigantic body, why not gigantic volume of gas? This is the explanation."
Jñāna,"The materialistic scientists, they are saying that matter is energy. So we understand if it's energy there must be an energetic.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So how the energetic is producing, this is common. Gas is forming. Just like you perspire, there is water. So one ounce of water may come from your body. So water is coming from your body, so why not from the gigantic body ofKṛṣṇa, the oceans, millions of oceans, come out? This should be the understanding. We see practically that water is coming out from my body. So it may be one ounce or less than that because my body is very small, but Kṛṣṇa's body is unlimited, so why not unlimited supply of water? This should be the common sense. And this body, this body, what it is? It is earth. When the body will be dead it will be earth. So I am spirit soul, a small particle, so much earth is coming from me, why notKṛṣṇa, the supreme spirit? This is the explanation. God is great, I am small. From me a small quantity of earth is coming, water is coming. Why not from the gigantic body ofKṛṣṇa, so huge, I mean to say, volume of water, gas, and everything as we see it is coming? So thereforeKṛṣṇais correct. He's correct, but for our understanding we can understand like this, chemicals, the chemicals coming from our body. There are so many salt. And you test the blood or the perspiration. You'll find so many chemicals."
Brahmānanda,For us to... For our body to produce earth...,Prabhupāda,"Now, just to understand that I am part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa, so the chemical and the water and the earth is coming from my body, so why not Kṛṣṇa's body, gigantic, the greatest, the chemicals, water, earth, water...? WhenKṛṣṇasays, bhūmir āpo 'nalo, ""It is My energy,"" that's fact. Where is the difficulty to understand? We can... We are little sample of God, a small God. So if we can produce, this body... The spirit soul as I have described yesterday, one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair, it is very, very minute. From that minute spirit so much earth, water, fire is coming. So why not the supreme spirit, huge quantity of water, earth, will not come? How one can deny it?"
Harikeśa,"Well, but verbal analogies don't prove the scientific a fact.",Prabhupāda,"Then you are a rascal. Verbal analogy is proof. A small quantity, a small quantity producing; large quantity, large quantity producing. Where is the verbal? This is practical."
Harikeśa,"But that's assuming that God has a body, or there even is a God.",Prabhupāda,"Huh? But that is... You are blind rascal, you cannot see. That does not mean that He has no body. You cannot see even the president's body here. That means president has no body? You rascal, you cannot understand. Because you cannot see the president's body, you cannot say, ""No, the president is bodyless."" That is your defect. You become qualified to see the president. You'll see he has got a body. Those who are not qualified to see him, they can say that he has not body. But why he has no body?śāstrasays. So if you remain fools and rascals, that is another thing, but He has a body.Iśvaraḥparamaḥkṛṣṇaḥsac-cid-ānanda,Brahmāis saying. Why He has no body?Sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha[Bs.5.1].Vigrahameans body."
Harikeśa,"But we don't know, so we're taking the known and speculating on that...",Prabhupāda,"You do not know; therefore you have to learn. If you want to remain rascal, fool, and still you want to know, that is not possible. You have to know from the real source. Then you'll know. But if you keep yourself in the rascal platform, then how you will know? Just like you have to go to a school to learn things. So how you can learn at home?Tad-vijñānārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet[MU1.2.12].You have to go in order to understand that science. So how do you argue, keeping yourself in darkness? In darkness you cannot see anything. ""Oh, I do not see anything; therefore there is nothing."" Is that very good reason? You are blind, you cannot see the darkness. That is another thing. But things are there. You make your eyes operated and manifest your vision. Then you'll see. Therefore,ajñāna-timirāndhasya jñānāñjana-śalākayā cakṣur-unmīlitaṁyenatasmaiśrī-guravenamaḥ.Everyone is blind, in darkness. He cannot see anything. So one who opens the eyes,jñānāñjana-śalākayā,by the torch of knowledge, he isguru. This is description ofguru. If you are blind and have a blindguru, that is no use.Gurumeans who is not blind. I may be blind. Then that will be effective. This is no reason, ""I cannot see."" What you are? You can see? You cannot see even the president, and you want to see God without being qualified? This is laymans', rascal's reason, ""I cannot see. I do not see."" What you are? What you can see? You do not first of all evaluate what is your position, and you want to see something. The formula is there.Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanenasantaḥsadaivahṛdayeṣuvilokayanti[Bs.5.38].One who has developed love of God is always seeing God. So where is that qualification? You are not lover of God, you are lover of dog, so how you can see God? You can see dog. That's all. Go on seeing dog perpetually. And at the time of death see the dog and become a dog. That's all."
Harikeśa,So I have to accept all this on faith.,Prabhupāda,"Not faith, it is practical. You are so foolish, you do not understand. Unless you are qualified, you cannot see anything. So you have to qualify. It is not faith. Disqualified. You are disqualified."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Like sometimes you make the example you can't see the president unless you are qualified to see the president.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Likewise, you can't see God unless you are qualified.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is wanted. It is not faith; it is fact. Unless you are fit to see something, you cannot see."
Jñāna,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, you're making comparison with the water coming from the gigantic body ofKṛṣṇa. The sweat, that's coming from water we took before. It's already existing.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Jñāna,It's not produced out of nothing.,Prabhupāda,Not without drinking? No. That's not fact.
Brahmānanda,Actually they say the body is made out of water.,Prabhupāda,"""They say. They say."" You don't drink water, and when you give me massage why do you perspire? You did not drink water. This is practical."
Brahmānanda,But formerly I had drunk water.,Prabhupāda,"No, formerly, three hundred years, you had some water; therefore the water is coming out. This is all nonsense. Seven generation before my great-grandfather ate some ghee, and still I have got the smell. (laughter) It is that argument.Huh? This kind of argument has no value. Water is... You can create water from your body. What is there? You are a doctor. What is your...? Eh? Medical men they are. No? Water is created. How the blood is created? He did not drink blood. This is nonsense argument. How we create blood? It is becoming. You do not know how it is, but you have got such potency that blood is being created. You even do not know how the blood is being done, but it is being. That is inconceivable energy. There are so many secretions. They are coming within the body. So everything is there. By God's supreme energy they are being automatically.Svābhāvikījñāna-bala-kriyāca.Parāsyaśaktir vividhaivaśrūyate[Cc.Madhya13.65,purport].God has got multi-energies.Natasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyate.This is the description. He hasn't got to do anything. Just like so many things are being manufactured within my body. I haven't got to directly work for it. So similarly, the God's gigantic...Natasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyate.He has nothing to do.Natasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyate.Natat-samaś cābhyadhikaścadṛśyate.Nobody is found equal to Him or greater than Him. We are... He is God, and we are subordinate because we have many equals, but He has no equal. He is unlimited; we are limited.Parāsyaśaktir vivdhaivaśrūyate.He has got multi-energies. The energies are working. Just like here there are so many instruments within this box, but you just push one button and it works. You just push one button; the whole thing is working. So similarly, the God has made this body so perfect that whatever is required, it is being manufactured. Nobody can explain. Can you explain how your hair is... You shave today, and tomorrow again, how it is growing, can you explain? But it is coming out. The energy is there. Similarly, if in the small body, a sample of God, so many energies are there, automatically working, then, so far God is concerned, thatparāsyaśaktir,He has got unlimited number of energies and things are taking place automatically. This material world is also external body ofKṛṣṇa. Just like our body, external body, and the hair is coming out. Do you endeavor for it? Similarly, the trees, plants, they are coming out."
Jñāna,If I eat a lot I become fat. If I stop eating I become thin.,Prabhupāda,"You stupid, you eat so much, but God is not stupid. He is conscious perfectly. He has nothing to eat. Still, He can grow. That is the difference between me and God. You don't require to eat even. There are many saintly persons they do not eat. How they are working?RaghunāthadāsaGosvāmī was not eating. He was... Every alternate day he was, little butter, so much. That's all, not daily. Every alternate day. So actually we do not require to eat. Eating, sleeping, sex and defense—this is bodily necessities. But you are not this body. When you come to the spiritual platform there is no necessity of these four principles. So that is your mistake, that you are thinking, ""God has got a body like me. He requires eating for nourishing it."" That is your foolishness.Aṅgāniyasyasakalendriya-vṛttimanti.His body is so made that He can perform any limb's work by another limb. Just like we can see with the eyes. As soon as close the eyes, we cannot see. ButKṛṣṇacan see by His ear. As soon as you pray toKṛṣṇa, immediately He sees you, ""Oh, here is My devotee,"" by hearing the sound of your prayer."
Devotee(4):,"Devotee(4):Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that our body was made by (indistinct). Why should we (indistinct)? But why should we come back?",Prabhupāda,"Because you have this material body, you have got so many necessities and God has no material body. He has got spiritual body. He has no necessity.Aptakama.He is fully satisfied. He doesn't require to take anything."
Brahmānanda,He doesn't get hungry or thirsty.,Prabhupāda,Neither. Neither of these things because He hasn't got material body. You have got this material body; therefore you have got all these defects.
Indian man (5):,Indian man (5):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So that is all for the material body. Weakness or strength or dwindling or becoming old isṣad-avikara. Ṣad-avikarameans birth, then growth, then sustenance, then by-products, then dwindling, then finish. Thisṣad-avikara,six kinds of changes, are meant for the material body, not for the spiritual."
Harikeśa,"So everything is going on, and those things that are going on and they happen to fit in with the whole scheme, they continue. If there is some strength they survive, and if not, they die off, so everything is happening by chance. But because...",Prabhupāda,Chance?
Harikeśa,"Yes, chance. But because... (laughter) But because...",Prabhupāda,Another stupidity. (laughter)
Harikeśa,"But because some things happen to work, they continue.",Prabhupāda,Will the medical man will say that everything happening by chance?
Harikeśa,"Well, that's because his body is all right. His body fits in with the scheme of things, so it can continue. But let's say the person doesn't eat, he can't get...",Prabhupāda,"They know that you have violated these rules of health, therefore you are diseased. There is no chance."
Harikeśa,But he is fit to live so he can live. But someone other than...,Prabhupāda,"Nobody is fit. The doctors also become sick as soon as there is violation. The violation is the cause of sickness, so either he may be doctor or no doctor, that does not matter. If you violate, you'll be sick. That is nature's law. Nature's law."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Speaking of chance, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it was mentioned in the scriptures that, inThe Nectar of Devotion,that in order to be involved in devotional service and execute devotional service in this life, we had to have some devotional service last life. So therefore, were you here last life too, to give us this devotional service?",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Brahmānanda,He's asking that inThe Nectar of Devotionit is stated that for one to engage in devotional service means that in his previous life he had some connection with devotional service. So he's...,Prabhupāda,So where is the chance? It is the cause and effect. If previous life you had some activities and the result is there. So where is chance?
Harikeśa,"So that's survival of the fittest. Because he could take to devotional service, he is surviving on in devotional service.",Prabhupāda,"Surviving... So he is surviving, but the cause and effect is going on."
Jñāna,The scientists are saying the evolution of the body is purely by chance.,Prabhupāda,"That is nonsense. Therefore we call them stupid, rascals. There is no chance.Kāranaṁguṇa-saṅgo 'sya,Kṛṣṇasays,kāraṇam[Bg.13.22].There is no question of chance.Kāranaṁguṇa-saṅgo 'sya.Because you do not know how you are infecting... Just like you become all of a sudden attacked with cholera. You are thinking that it is by chance. It is not chance. Eh? What this medical man will... ""It is chance."" No. You infected somewhere. You do not know. And because you are foolish, you are taking it as chance. There is no question of chance."
Harikeśa,But it was by chance I infected.,Prabhupāda,"No, not chance. Why did you go where there is cholera case? That is your foolishness. Why did you go there? When there is infectious disease a man is forbidden, not to go there. So you went there without any knowledge and you infected. Now you are suffering. That's all. There is no question of chance. That is foolishness. Chance means ignorance. The ignorant people, they do not know. They infect sinful activities, and they say, ""by chance."" There is no question of chance.Kāranaṁguṇa-saṅgo 'sya,Kṛṣṇasays. There is no chance."
Cyavana,"If God's energy is so perfect, then how does this ignorance come upon the living entity?",Prabhupāda,"That we have explained many times. You create your ignorance. Just like you cannot live without servingKṛṣṇa, but you create: ""Why not independently?"" That is your ignorance. By law, by nature's law, you cannot live without being subordinate toKṛṣṇa. But why you are thinking, ""Why shall I be subordinate toKṛṣṇa?""Kṛṣṇais asking you,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁ[Bg.18.66].Why you are not doing that? Why you are not doing that?Kṛṣṇais personally asking, ""You do this. I shall save you."" Why you are not doing this? So you violate the laws ofKṛṣṇa. You suffer. That's all."
Cyavana,"But if that energy is perfect, how can it violate?",Prabhupāda,"Then you do not know what is living being. Living being has got the, I mean to say, independence, little independence. He can obey; he can violate. In our society there are so many. Somebody is strictly obeying, somebody is willfully, voluntary..., not voluntarily, willfully violating. They must fall down."
Jñāna,"If God is perfect, why didn't He make us perfect?",Prabhupāda,"He is made perfect, but He is not... You are not stone. God is not stone. You are living being. The same thing you are repeatedly asking. You have got little independence because you are part and parcel of God. So by misusing your independence, if you violate the orders of God, then you suffer. You are perfect because you have got independence, but you misuse that perfectness. That is your fault. You perfect. You become imperfect by misusing."
Jñāna,Independence?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Everything is perfect.Pūrṇasyapūrṇamādāyapūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate,pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate[IsoInvocation].Because you are part and parcel of God, you are perfect, but willfully you become imperfect. Again you become perfect; then you become imperfect."
Jñāna,Where does that will come from?,Prabhupāda,"Will is given to you. Living being means there is will—thinking, feeling and willing. Don't question if you do not know. Everything comes from God. What is the use of ""Where will comes?""Janmādyaasyayataḥ.Ahaṁsarvasyaprabhavomattaḥsarvam...[Bg.10.8].Everything is coming fromKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇahas got will; you have got will. Why do you ask? This is foolishness.Kṛṣṇahas got independence; you have got independence. You are a smallKṛṣṇa. A particle of gold is also gold. Everything is there. All chemical composition is there. It has come fromKṛṣṇa. Why you are asking wherefrom it comes?"
Jñāna,"All living beings are independent, but some choose to serve and some choose to disbelieve.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is use of independence. Otherwise what is the meaning of independence? The meaning of independence is: ""If I like, I can do. If I do not like, I do not do."" That is independence. That means independence. If you are stereotyped, forced to do, that is not independence. Independence means if you like, you can do it, if not—you don't like-don't do it. That is independence. So misused independence means ignorance. He does not know that ""If I infect this virus of this disease I'll suffer."" But he does not know, ignorance. So he infects and he suffers."
Devotee (6):,"Devotee (6):Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was noticing yourŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamsthe other day andCaitanya-caritāmṛta.So I would like to take my time this time and offer my obeisances for such perfected, exalted work from such an exalted personality. All glories to you.",Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. (devotees offer obeisances) Thank you very much.
Devotee (6):,"Devotee (6):I haven't seen anything so beautiful, so transcendental.",Prabhupāda,Try to understand. Make your life successful.
Devotee (6):,"Devotee (6):I will with your mercy, with your grace. I need help.",Prabhupāda,"That is my endeavor. I am trying to put things how people will understand and they become perfect. That is my endeavor, humble endeavor. That's all."
Jñāna,"Thank you very much, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa.
Indian woman (7):,Indian woman (7):(Hindi) [break],Prabhupāda,"...say that if he remain forward even in the front of danger, that is his first credit."
Indian woman (7):,Indian woman (7):(Hindi),Prabhupāda,"It was a great service. That was a great service, recognized. [break]"
Devotee (8):,Devotee (8):It's a type of poem.,Prabhupāda,"Anyway, so this, like sword. The tree is just like sword, and the sinful man is pushed through that tree."
Jñāna,"Prabhupāda, I've heard that even in hell the people think they are enjoying. Is that right?",Prabhupāda,Where you have heard? (laughter)
Jñāna,I thought that that was your own words.,Prabhupāda,Don't think like that.
Cyavana,Not to think but to know.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That is our position.
Devotee (8):,"Devotee (8):Prabhupāda? Some of the people I've met... Like in the later volumes ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,some of the information is so much against what the living entities are experiencing and being educated in, that I've noticed that some people have turned away fromKṛṣṇawho already had some attraction when they hear these different topics, like the situation of the universe.",Prabhupāda,Hm? What is that?
Brahmānanda,"That because inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamthe knowledge there contradicts the mundane scientific knowledge, people who had some faith inKṛṣṇabecome discouraged and turn away fromKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,"Let him go away. Don't care for him. Let all the fools go away. There is Bengali proverb, ""Instead of maintaining some bad cows, let the cowshed be vacant."" We shall prefer the cowshed vacant, no cow, than keeping all bad cows who does not give any milk, create disturbance."
Devotee (8):,Devotee (8):In our temple...,Prabhupāda,"We are giving chance, but we don't want bad cows. We haven't got to agree with their views. They must agree with our views, then they can live. Otherwise let them go away. This is position."
Brahmānanda,Are we all equal in the eyes of God?,Prabhupāda,"But if you become unequal, you must go away. No. His question was they are disturbed. So that means they are unequal. Why they should be disturbed?"
Cyavana,"Kṛṣṇasays, ""All of them, as they surrender, I reward accordingly."" So that means they are surrendering in different...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. He has not surrendered. He keeps himself separate fromKṛṣṇa, and he is, artificially he shows surrender. Surrender does not mean that you reserve something for you. That is not surrender. Surrender means without reservation. That is surrender."
Devotee (8):,"Devotee (8):Devotional service must be unconditional, or else it will drive us away.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like a child is surrendered to the parents. The parents say, ""Sit down here."" He sit down. That's all. No argument. That is surrender."
Indian (10):,"Indian (10):Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we speak of parts and parcels of God, does it mean that we were there with God before we came to this world?",Prabhupāda,You are part and parcel then? What is that?
Brahmānanda,If we are part and parcels of God does it mean that we were with God before coming to the...,Prabhupāda,"You are always with God, even your rebellious condition, you are with God. Just like a prisoner. A prisoner is always with the government, (laughter) but in one department he is kicked, and in one department he is patted. That's all. So if you prefer to be kicked, you remain inmāyā.But you are always in connection with God."
Indian man (11):,"Indian man (11):LordKṛṣṇasays, ""I am in everything.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Your, this punishment condition is also God's creation, external energy. You cannot live for a second without God. But one who knows, he is blessed, and who does not know, he is condemned. But you know or not know, you are always with God. That is your position."
Devotee (12):,"Devotee (12):Śrīla Prabhupāda, how best can we present the teachings of...",Prabhupāda,Just abide by the orders of God and His representative. Then you be happy. Otherwise not.
Harikeśa,"This side, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,Sarvadharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].That is the verse.
Devotees:,Devotees:JayaŚrīla Prabhupāda. Thank you.,Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. (end) ...brain.
Brahmānanda,That's an accident. That's an accident.,Prabhupāda,Accident. All accidents make symmetrically so beautiful.
Harikeśa,"So in the beginning only it was an accident. Then it became regular, after that first accident.",Prabhupāda,Yes. So in the beginning let us kick. Then things will be all right. [break]Bhagavad-gītāsays in the beginning? Hm? What is the beginning?
Brahmānanda,Ahaṁbīja-pradaḥpitā[Bg.14.4].,Prabhupāda,"Ah.Bījo 'haṁsarva-bhūtānām[Bg7.10],very good. Thank you very much. All these plants begins from the seed. That seed...Kṛṣṇasays, ""I am the seed."" So how it is accident? Every plant has got a particular type of seed. You cannot change it. You take two seeds. It will grow as it is; it will grow as it is. Not that by accident it will grow like this and it will grow like this, no.Roseseed will growrosetree, and mango seed will grow mangoes. Where is accident? The seed is there. Simply rascals."
Harikeśa,It's an accident where the seed falls.,Prabhupāda,Then you are great scientist. Let me kick on your face. (laughter)
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):What about cross-breeding, when they change the...? Cross-breeding.",Prabhupāda,"That is not accident, cross-breeding. You arrange for that."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):They change the original seed.,Prabhupāda,"Then what is that? That is not accident. You are doing that. How you say it is accident? Why do you put this rascal question? As you are doing otherwise, it is coming otherwise. How you can say it is accident? Accident means nobody interferes; it comes. That is accident."
Harikeśa,"Well, it may not be an accident, but it proves how we're becoming superior to the nature. We can control it. More and more, every day we're controlling.",Prabhupāda,"How you can become superior? Nature has already given you, and then you are able to act. Where is your superiority?Huh?"
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):That is a good point.,Prabhupāda,"[break] ...given by God.Mattaḥsmṛtirjñānamapohanam.You have no intelligence even, so that is given by God. (Hindi) Let them become devotees. Why these old men, they are not coming? They are still after money?Amaraaj&#241ayaguruhanataraeideśa[Cc.Madhya7.128],CaitanyaMahāprabhusays. So you have come to this country. Do something good for these Africans. Let them become devotee. Where is that attempt? The white men, they also came to exploit them, and you have also come to exploit them. ButCaitanyaMahāprabhusays, ""No-paraupakara.""Upakarakara.That isCaitanyaMahāprabhu's... They are not so advanced; make them advanced. That is real cooperation. (Hindi) [break] Just like every one of them is attached to remain in Africa, continuing to... But they are being forcefully driven away: ""Go away."" Attachment must be there. The Englishmen, they have got attachment, but they were forcefully driven away. Similarly, this conditioned soul, he has got attachment. Andśāstraandśāstra... These people were driven away byśāstra,,by weapon, knife. That isśāstra.Andśāstrais the same thing, but it is books. Therefore it is calledśāstra.The original word is coming fromśās.

So just likeguru-śisya.Theguru, he gives enlightenment, andśisyavoluntarily accepts. That isguru-śisya.Similarlyśāstrameans weapon: ""If you don't follow, then I shall cut your throat."" Similarlyśāstra.Sośāstrasays that ""Now you must leave your family life."" That is calledvānaprastha.So that is not being carried out, although theśāstrainjunction is there.Brahmacari,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,sannyāsa.Sobrahmacārīis the beginning of life, how to become controlled life. Then he is allowed the concession for sense gratification. This isgṛhastha.Thenśāstrasays, ""Now you have done up to fifty years. Now get out."" But nobody is following. They are not prepared to get out unless death forces to get out. ThatKṛṣṇadoes.Mṛtyuḥsarva-haraś cāham[Bg.10.34].He is not willing. He has got attachment. He doesn't want. Then, at last,Kṛṣṇacomes as death: ""Now get out."" Kick out. ""Oh, I have got so many things. I have got my sons, daughters, and this, that."" ""Get out. No question."" And whatever you have accumulated, that is forfeit. That's all. The same process, just Africa government: ""Get out."" And what you have attained? All taken away. The sameśāstra, śis, śās-dhātu."
Indian woman:,"Indian woman:Śrīla Prabhupāda, I am very surprised. I'm not born in India but I born in Africa. But why this culture I had in my heart from the start even? Forty-five years, that time was my... Forty years. And I only see my husband also. So I will give you service in this for fifty years. As you'll need any service from me, you take from me. Only...",Prabhupāda,"That means in your previous life you were in these activities. That comes. That dictates, ""Now do it."" So even though you became woman, still, that instinct was there. You had it done in your previous life. That is stated in theBhagavad-gita."
Indian woman:,"Indian woman:I was waiting to decide, but I thinking, ""How I go to seeKṛṣṇa?""",Prabhupāda,Śucināmśrīmatāṁgehe[Bg.6.41].What is that?
Indian woman:,Indian woman:So you come in my life. Before that time I was only forty-eight years.,Prabhupāda,"So now the older section of the Indians, they should give up their family life and live in this temple, cultivate this spiritual life and preach. You see. There will be very nice relationship."
Indian woman:,"Indian woman:Everyone, every state, this is true. Sometimes I go to preaching. I not looking ""Asian,"" or such and such. Anyone I go to preach.",Prabhupāda,"We are all part and parcel of God. The outward dress only makes difference that ""I am African,"" ""I am Indian,"" ""I am this.""Paṇḍitaḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18].Therefore one who is learned, he does not make that difference. That is accidental, that by... You can say acci... That is also not accidental, but some way or other, it has become so. The dress is different. But our movement is not with the dress but with the living being who has the dress. This is movement. Our, this is completely spiritual movement."
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):Many intelligent people in Africa, they are taking it very seriously. We have one professor, Entenjania Danisanjunibristi. He's a very young boy. So he bought yourBhagavad-gītāandBhagavatdāsawas there. So he took all the picture out, all the picture, and he framed. I have seen in the room. He put all the pictures in his room. Then he was writing me from a long time. He became our patron life member, and now he chants sixteen rounds. He has gone to London for our course. He said, ""After finishing this course I will take initiation from His Divine Grace. Then I will dedicate my whole life to preach in the university.""",Prabhupāda,He is Indian or African?
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):No, no, African. He's a professor. Oh, yes. You have seen the letter, I think. So when I was in, then I was in Mandena's room. He said ""No, you stay with me. Don't stay with the Asians."" So I was in (?) university, you know. He said Asian can take this philosophy and not be so serious. Now he has gone to London. He may see you when you will be there, for a year. And he chants sixteen rounds. He has nobody, no picture else in his room. There was one picture of the president there. He took it down and he put aKṛṣṇapicture there. So it's very serious. And he said, ""I don't know. Since I have read theBhagavad-gītāI go to my class to give a class to the students and I don't speak anything else about the scriptures.""",Prabhupāda,That is the sign.
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):And he's a very strong, Prabhupāda, also, very strong.",Prabhupāda,"That is said aboutPrahlādaMahārājawhen he was boy. So he has been described askṛṣṇa-graha-praptaḥ.Just like under the influence of planet one becomes, what is called, ghostly haunted, like that, so devotee means when he becomesKṛṣṇahaunted. That is wanted. That isKṛṣṇaconscious. He does not think anything else exceptKṛṣṇa. That is wanted.Kṛṣṇa-graha-praptaḥ."
Indian woman:,"Indian woman:(indistinct) ...a few days before I been here for the (indistinct) my family complained me, ""Mom, you don't know. Yesterday was very big day. Oh, you forget."" (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa's wedding ceremony (indistinct) myself I forget everything. They start to complain go there (indistinct) I have not anything. They start to talk with me business, this and that. (indistinct) immediately I will give. Answer immediately because I always Sometimes guest there are I start to preach (indistinct) say something. It's okay. Then you like talking your matter. Then I will talk (indistinct).",Prabhupāda,(aside:) Don't spoil your nail.
Brahmānanda,"When someone takes so spontaneously, like this African, without any preaching, but just spontaneously take...",Prabhupāda,Yes. They are not yet so advanced.
Devotee (5):,Devotee (5):They always say the Africans could never becomeKṛṣṇaconscious.,Prabhupāda,How they are becoming?
Devotee (5):,Devotee (5):They don't believe.,Prabhupāda,Believe? You do not see even?
Devotee (5):,"Devotee (5):But they say that ""Oh, he will do it, and then, after one year, he will stop.""",Prabhupāda,"Well, that is another criticism. Somebody is eating nice yogurt. Everyone will say, ""Oh, it is very nice. It is very nice, very nice."" Another man says, ""Yes, it is nice, but after three days it will be sour."" (laughter) You rascal, you consider for the present. What ""after three days""? Means he's a bad critic, so he could not find out any fault. Everyone says it is good. So ""After three days it will be bad."" This sort of criticism. So you have already become bad. You were doing service to others. What does he do, that priest?"
Brahmānanda,He's a businessman.,Prabhupāda,Business. So is that...? The business is the occupation ofbrāhmaṇa? You are already fallen. How he can criticize others?
Indian woman:,"Indian woman:That is all,brāhmaṇas,allbrāhmaṇas,there is no big knowledge. That is Śiva. Śiva is the head.",Prabhupāda,"That's all. Śiva is the head, but whether you arebrāhmaṇa? That is the question."
Indian woman:,"Indian woman:They don't know, understand.",Prabhupāda,"Brāhmaṇa's qualification is there—śama,dama,titikṣa,ārjavamandjñānam,vijñānam,āstikyam,brahma-karma...[Bg.18.42].Everything is there, the symptoms. So you are doing business, the occupation of thevaiśyasorśūdras,and how you are claiming to becomebrāhmaṇa? The... Who is abrāhmaṇa,that symptoms is there in theśāstra.And not only the symptoms,NāradaMunihas said, ""If these symptoms are found elsewhere, then he should be accepted according to the symptom."" There is no question of birth.Yasyahiyaḹlakṣanāmproktaṁvarṇābhivyanjakaṁ yady anyātrāpidṛṣyetatattenaiva viniriset.This is Nārada's vision. So it is the symptom. Just like a doctor, medical man. He diagnoses according to the symptom. He finds out the cause. So symptom is required, not that a man has become diseased or healthy by birth. No. By birth he is born. Then again, when he develops certain types of symptom, so one has to take him in that way. That isśāstra.We are accepting, or giving them sacred thread,brāhmaṇa,after seeing that they are actually acting as abrāhmaṇa,not superficially. Therefore we take some time to see whether he can develop brahminical symptom. That is our process, not that anyone comes, and we give him a sacred thread and he becomes immediatelybrāhmaṇa.We don't do this. First of all give him chance. Let him chantHareKṛṣṇa, follows the rules and regulations. Then let us see. If he is actually serious, he has developed the symptom, then... This is the proper way. Even one comes from thebrāhmaṇafamily—he wants initiation—we don't give immediately, even if he is coming from abrāhmaṇa...That is a good facility, that he is born in abrāhmaṇafamily, but the symptom is the first necessity. Either you are born in abrāhmaṇafamily orśūdrafamily, it doesn't matter."
Brahmānanda,"He's saying that thebrāhmaṇaswho comes from our overseas temples here, it's their responsibility to see that the Africans follow properly, because the Africans will follow their example.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is for that purpose they have come. That is the purpose, missionary purpose, here. We come here not to earn some money but to see that this culture is spread. So what is his question?"
Brahmānanda,So it's the responsibility then of those who are coming as the missionaries to set the proper example.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, certainly."
Brahmānanda,Because then the Africans will follow that proper example.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Yes, he is right."
Brahmānanda,"If they set a bad example, then they will follow bad example, then the criticism of the Indians will be justified.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That's it. So those who cannot follow, they should not come here. And ask from the origin that ""Those who cannot strictly follow the rules and regulations, they should not come at all. It will set a bad example. They should be forbidden to come here."" That I was speaking, that instead of filling with bad cows, better keep the cowshed vacant. That I was speaking. Those who cannot strictly follow our principles, they should not come here. It is bad example. By mistake, if somebody does, he should be regretful and he should rectify. That is another thing. But not willingly he should neglect. Then such person is not required at all."
Devotee (7):,"Devotee (7):Prabhupāda, in the movement there is sometimes difficulty, and...",Prabhupāda,What is the difficulty? You chant sixteen rounds and follow the regulative... Where is the difficulty?
Cyavana,"Then what is your instruction? If they won't accept your instruction, then what is your instruction? Must be bogus.Huh? If your instruction is pure, then they'll accept. If your instruction is not pure, who will accept? I will not accept.",Prabhupāda,"No, ""Example is better than precept."" If you actually follow strictly the rules and regulations and chant sixteen rounds, why they'll not follow? They'll follow. If you are not attending class, if you are not attendingmaṅgalaārati,if you are not finishing sixteen rounds, then that is bad example."
Brahmānanda,This boy didn't attendmangalārati.,Prabhupāda,Don't set bad example. That is detrimental.
Devotee (7):,"Devotee (7):Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it for the advanced devotees...?",Prabhupāda,Nobody is advanced. Everyone is student. He must follow. There is no question of advanced.
Devotee (7):,"Devotee (7):I mean, they callśūdras...",Prabhupāda,"Śūdras? Śūdra,how he can be devotee?Śūdrasare never devotee."
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):No, he says sometimes the devotees, they call the other devotee that ""You areśūdra.""",Prabhupāda,That is jokingly. (laughter)
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):Prabhupāda, sometimes you have said that thisGāyatrīwas first spoken by the Lord, and this is a sound vibration of the Kṛṣṇa's flute, and it was heard byBrahma. Right? And thesebrāhmaṇas,so-calledbrāhmaṇas...",Prabhupāda,"There is no question of ""so-called."" We want realbrāhmaṇa.That's all. It was heard by the realbrāhmaṇa,Brahma.Brahma,Brahma."
Indian man (4):,Indian man (4):So they worshipGāyatrī.They say it like as a...,Prabhupāda,"They... Whatever they say, you forget that. You do your own duty. You follow the rules and regulation and do the needful. Why you...?"
Indian man (4):,Indian man (4):But we have to make them understand very clearly.,Prabhupāda,"But they will never understand. You don't waste your time. Go on with your duty. When they will see that you are actually acting asbrāhmaṇa,they will appreciate."
Indian woman:,Indian woman:Time will come. They will notice.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, they will appreciate. But if you don't follow strictly, then it is useless to criticize them also. You are also victim; they are also victim."
Devotee (8):,"Devotee (8):When chanting our sixteen rounds, we are not sure if these rounds are sincere...",Prabhupāda,You should be sure.
Devotee (8):,Devotee (8):How can we be sure?,Prabhupāda,There is beads.
Brahmānanda,"No, he's saying that when we chant our rounds, how can we be sure that when we chant the round that the round is a perfect, attentive round, sincere?",Prabhupāda,"Therefore it isśāstra,""You must."" There is no question of understanding."
Brahmānanda,The quality of the chanting he's asking. How can we make the quality the best?,Prabhupāda,"Quality, you'll understand first of all come to the quality. Without having quality, how he'll understand the quality? You follow the instruction of your spiritual master, of theśāstra.That is your duty. Quality, no quality—it is not your position to understand. When the quality comes there is no force. You will have a taste for chanting. You will desire at that time, ""Why sixteen round? Why not sixteen thousand rounds?"" That is quality. That is quality. It is by force. You'll not do it; therefore at least sixteen rounds. But when you come to the quality, you will feel yourself, ""Why sixteen? Why not sixteen thousand?"" That is quality, automatically. Just likeHaridāsaṬhākura was doing. He was not forced to do. EvenCaitanyaMahāprabhu, He requested, ""Now you are old enough. You can reduce."" So he refused, ""No. Up to the end of my life I shall go on."" That is quality. Have you got such tendency that you will go on chanting and nothing to do? That is quality. Now you are forced to do. Where is the question of quality? That is given a chance so that one day you may come to the quality, not that you have come to the quality. Quality is different.Athāśaktiḥ.Aśakti,attachment. Just likeRūpaGosvāmī says that ""How shall I chant with one tongue, and how shall I hear, two ears? Had it been millions of tongue and trillions of ear, then I could enjoy it."" This is quality. Quality is not so cheap. Maybe after many births. For the time being you go on following the rules and regulations. It is being done by force. Where is the quality? So you wanted to understand quality. This is the quality. You'll not be forced, but automatically you'll desire. That is quality. I am writing books. I am not being forced by anyone. Everyone can do that. Why one does not do it? Why I get up at night, one o'clock, and do this job? Because I cannot do without it. How one will do it artificially? This is quality. Therefore they like my purports. That quality is shown byCaitanyaMahāprabhu.Śunyayitaṁjagatsarvaṁgovindavirahename.""Oh, I do not seeGovinda. The whole world is vacant.""Śunyayitaṁjagatsarvaṁgovindavirahename.This is quality. Just like we have got practical example. One man's beloved has died, and he is seeing the whole universe vacant. Is it vacant? So that is quality of love. So there is no formula of quality. It is to be understood by himself. Just like if after eating something you feel refreshed and get strength, that is quality. You haven't got to take certificate: ""Will you give me a certificate that I have eaten?"" You'll understand whether eaten or not. That is quality. When you will feel so much ecstasy in chantingHareKṛṣṇa, that is quality. Not artificially—""Chant. Chant. Otherwise get out."" This is not quality. This is in expectation that someday you may come to quality. That requires time. That requires sincerity. But quality is there.Śravanādiśuddhacittekaraye...It will be awakened. Not by force. Just like love between two persons, it cannot be forced. ""You must love him. You must love her."" Oh, that is no love. That is not love. When automatically you love one another, that is quality.Doravede(?)prema.And therefore formerly, at least in the Indian society, at an early age they were married. There is no quality in that quality. But gradually, remaining together, the quality of love increases. Then the wife takes care of the husband, and the husband takes care. They become bound up, united in love. That is quality. In the beginning, what the child knows about love? No. But they are allowed to remain as husband and wife. They are thinking that ""I have got my husband,"" ""I have got my wife,"" and as the age increases, the dealings become intimate. Then they become affectionate. That is quality. Not in the beginning there is any quality. It is by the parents' arrangement. That's all. In our day, the marriage was performed when the girl is ten years, twelve years, nine years. Twelve years is very late marriage. My second sister, she became twelve years old. So my mother became so disturbed that ""This girl is not being married. Shall I commit suicide?"" Yes. You see? My eldest sister, she was nine years old, older than me, and she was married before my birth. And my mother-in-law was married at the age of seven years, and my father-in-law was eleven years. I was married... My wife was eleven years. So in this age there is no question of love. It is not that the husband and wife lives together, no. Unless the girl is grown up, she is not going to the husband. She remains with the father and mother. Sometimes they meet, and the wife is taught, giving some sweetmeat to the husband-official. Official. The parents of the girl: ""Just go up to your husband and offer this."" So she comes as obedient servant. But gradually they get the connection. In this way the love develops, and when they are fifteen, sixteen years old, they are allowed to live together. Because both of them have already developed that ""She is my wife,"" ""He is my husband,"" psychologically. And there was no question of divorce. The love is so strong, they cannot dream even that ""I have to leave my wife,"" ""I have to leave my husband."" They cannot dream it. They may fight. The husband and wife fighting, that is not unusual. Therefore CanakyaPaṇḍitasays, ""Fight between the husband, wife, never take it seriously.""Daṁpatye kalahe caiva baṁbhāraṁbhelaghu-kriya:""They'll make allarambha,but it is not very important. Don't take."" Next moment they will again live peacefully. So according to Indian culture, there is no divorce. There is no question of divorce. Both the husband and wife, they cannot dream of divorce. The love was so strong. Even Gandhi's life, he fought with his wife and pushed her out of the house: ""Get out, I don't want you."" And Kasturabhai, she began to cry on the street, ""Where shall I go? You have driven me away."" ThenGandhisaid, ""Come on."" Finished. (laughter) He has written in his life."
Harikeśa,"I'm curious about the destination of a neophyte devotee. If a neophyte devotee is with determination endeavoring for purification but he were to meet with death as he is still influenced by the lower modes, although he is seriously trying, then does he take another birth or does he go toKṛṣṇa?",Prabhupāda,"No, he has to take another birth. If he is not completely purified, he has to suffer another birth. Nobody is allowed to enter into the spiritual unless he is cent percent pure. No allowance. Then he has to... Therefore it is said,śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgeheyoga-bhraṣṭosañjāyate[Bg.6.41].He is given chance, another chance, to take birth in a very purebrāhmaṇafamily or rich family so that he may take again the chance, not in, he is allowed to enter. He is given a good chance again. That is his benefit. Even if you are failure, still, your next birth as a very first-class human being is guaranteed. Not for others. It is only for the yogis. If he is... Therefore it is said that ""What is the loss even if he is failure?""Tyaktvāsva-dharmaṁcaraṇāmbujaṁharerbhajann apakvo 'thapatettatoyadiyatrakvavaabhadramabhūdamuṣyakim[SB1.5.17].This verse is very important. Even by sentiment one comes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness and discharges the regulative duties, chantsHareKṛṣṇa, his next life is guaranteed as a human being. Even he does it for some time—he is not perfect—still, his next life is guaranteed. But others, there is no such guarantee. Even if he discharges his so-called duties, material duties, there is no guarantee that he'll become a human being. [break]"
Harikeśa,They let him stay in that body and then he went toHṛṣīkeśaand performed devotional service and then became perfect.,Prabhupāda,"No, he was already perfect, but to increase his desire—""How shall I goVaikuṇṭha?""—another time he had to go. He was a perfect; otherwise how he was saved from the Yamadutas?"
Harikeśa,"So if a devotee dies and remembersKṛṣṇa, although he is not perfect...",Prabhupāda,"Unless he is perfect, he cannot rememberKṛṣṇa. That is not possible. That is not possible. That is theory only. He must be perfect. Somehow or other, he fallen, soKṛṣṇagives him the chance. That is special concession for devotee. Some way or other, you become devotee. Even if you cannot finish the whole job, if you fall down, still, there is guarantee that you get your birth in a very good society. That is the prerogative."
Jñāna,What about likeMahārājaBhārata?,Prabhupāda,"That was also. IfMahārājaBhārata... It was punishment and reward also.MahārājaBhārata, although he became a deer, he remembered that he was such and such exalted position but ""I became attached to the deer and I forgot my regular duties.""MahārājaBhārata, he became so much attached to the deer, he forgot his regular duties. Therefore he was punished. But he remembered that ""I was in such exalted position. On account of my attachment to the deer I have fallen."" Therefore he rectified himself so that in his next life he became completely silent so that ""I may not fall down,""JadaBhārata. This association, material association, is so dangerous, so he remained just like a dull madman. That's all. He was talking with nobody; he was not mixing with anybody. Whatever one would do, he did not protest, but his knowledge was full."
Devotee (7):,Devotee (7):Is there any difference in (indistinct) when somebody is chantingjapaunder the tree and someone who is chantingjapain the temple?,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Brahmānanda,I think sometimes we recommend the devotees to chant their rounds in the temple rather than walk in other places.,Prabhupāda,"Why one should walk other places? Who has said that you go out, walk other places? Never said."
Devotee (7):,Devotee (7):It may not really be necessary.,Prabhupāda,No. You should chant in the temple. Why should you go to other place?
Devotee (7):,"Devotee (7):So there is no difference someone chanting out of the temple, in the temple.",Prabhupāda,"Why you should go outside? Who has allowed him to go outside? Unless he has got some important business for the temple, why one should go to outside? There is no need. That is the chance of falling down. Why you should go outside? We are arranging for the temple, for the food. Why? Because everyone should stick to the temple and the principles. Why you should go to outside? That should be stopped. You cannot go outside."
Devotee (7):,Devotee (7):May we go to the shop to buy something?,Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. That is for temple's benefit or business. That is another thing. Somebody goes to sell books, somebody goes to make some life members. That is another thing. Otherwise one is not allowed at all. Not whimsically ""I am going out."" Why you are spoiling your men?"
Devotee (9):,"Devotee (9):Prabhupāda, sometimes I've seen devotees say that they did not like to chant in the temple room with the opposite...",Prabhupāda,"Then that is a rascal. He is not a devotee. He is a rascal, when a devotee says... How you become devoted? If he does not like the temple and he thinks to be happy outside, what is he? What kind of devotee he is? He is not a devotee."
Devotee (9):,"Devotee (9):What I meant to say is he does not want to chant with women in the temple room. I have seen this before. He says, ""I do not want to chant in a room with women. I would rather be away from the women.""",Prabhupāda,That means he has got distinction between men and women. He is not yetpaṇḍit.Paṇḍitaḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18].He is a fool. That's all. He is a fool. So what is the value of his words? He is a fool.
Indian man (4):,Indian man (4):So he'll go first to make...,Prabhupāda,"He should always consider, ""There is woman, that's all. She is my mother."" That's all.Matṛvātpara-dareṣu.Then what is the...? Suppose you sit down with your mother and chant. What is the wrong? But he is not so strong; then he should go to the forest. Why he should live in the Nairobi city? On the street there are so many women. He will walk on the street closing the eyes? (laughter) This is all rascaldom. They are rascals. They are not devotees, simply rascals."
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):Some of our devotee goes to the other temple like SwamiNārāyaṇaand they want to see the ladies there, so then they are taking these instruction from them.",Prabhupāda,Our devotees go to SwamiNārāyaṇa?
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):Yes, they go. Here our devotees, they went to Mombassa for, after LordCaitanyaMahāprabhu. When I was not there, all of them went to Swami...",Prabhupāda,These things should be stopped. They leave their own temple and go to SwamiNārāyaṇatemple? Stop.
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):They likes their lunch. They goes for lunch. Yes, that's true. All of them went without asking me. About five, six devotees, immediately from here went to SwamiNārāyaṇa.",Prabhupāda,So this should be rectified.
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):And their theory is that... I asked Vipramukhya Swami that ""Why you have put this? Why you say to your disciple that we should not see the face of the woman?"" He said that, ""We should avoid."" But I said, ""Well, okay, when you are walking on the road automatically you will see the ladies."" He said, ""We turn our face to one side."" I said, ""First you have seen the woman. Then you are turning."" (laughter) ""You will look further. You have not seen the women. You have no sense, you know.""",Prabhupāda,"These are all bogus things. One should train himself thatmatravātpara-dareṣu,all women, ""my mother."" Then it will be possible to live... Therefore the etiquette is to address every woman,""Ma,ma,mother."" That is the etiquette."
Brahmānanda,"You say like ""Mother Rukmiṇī""? There's a devotee namedRukmiṇī. You say, ""Mother Rukmiṇī""? How do you address a woman? Do you say, ""Mother,"" and then the name of the devotee?",Prabhupāda,"No. ""Mother,"" simply."
Brahmānanda,"Just ""Mother.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. They should be addressed, ""Mother."" That will train."
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):In our Indian culture they don't call the name of the mother never, children don't.",Prabhupāda,"No. ""Mother,"" simply ""mother,"" that's all. And if the woman treats man as son, then it is all right. It is safe."
Indian woman:,"Indian woman:We got a very sweet sound. Everything we use""ji."" ""Matāji"", ""Pitaji,"" ""Brataji,"" ""Bahinji.""",Prabhupāda,"Or... And the woman says,""Beta.""(?) That's all right."
Devotee (5):,Devotee (5):The only trouble is in the West we're accustomed to not like our mothers.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Devotee (5):,Devotee (5):In the West we don't like our mothers.,Prabhupāda,So you should forget your West or East. [break]
Brahmānanda,"Similarly, wife should not be called ""Mother.""",Prabhupāda,"No. Therefore it is said, ""other's wife,"" not your wife. But Rāmakrishnan, he was saying his wife ""mother,"" and he became famous by this foolishness."
Indian man (4):,"Indian man (4):Rāmakrishnan, there are many like Shyāma mother. Her husband, he calls her ""mother.""",Prabhupāda,"Just see. In theBrahma-samajthey call the wife as ""sister,"" and the wife calls the husband ""brother,"" address like that."
Brahmānanda,Is it possible for a woman to become abrāhmaṇa?,Prabhupāda,He is... Woman is abrāhmaṇa's wife. Then she is automatically abrāhmaṇa.
Indian man (6):,"Indian man (6):Suppose she doesn't want to get married for the rest of her life, just wants to serve the Lord?",Prabhupāda,So in his spiritual position everyone is abrāhmaṇa.
Brahmānanda,But you givebrahminicalinitiation to unmarried women.,Prabhupāda,Yes. But on spiritual point she isbrāhmaṇa.On the spiritual platform there is no such distinction.
Devotee (7):,"Devotee (7):Oh, it's not possible for a woman to become asannyāsī.",Prabhupāda,No.
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):What is the position of the woman in a..., late in life, the wife of a devotee?",Prabhupāda,What is that position?
Brahmānanda,What is the duties of the woman after the husband takessannyāsa?,Prabhupāda,"So remain a devotee, widow. She is not allowed to marry."

Girirāja:,Girirāja:Have agatein the middle of the wall and so many people will be passing. It will be a big international center so it will look bad for India that...,Prabhupāda,Yes.

Dr. Dr. Patel:,Dr. Dr. Patel:My son and his wife came. Especially for them... They don't have other holidays.,Prabhupāda,(Hindi) [break] What is the use of the fighting?
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:I have heard that the man could have first landed on moon and then...,Prabhupāda,Nobody landed. This is all bogus.
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:No, no, whatever he did... Let us... It is all bogus, but that man is divorced by his wife because he has lost his sex. Somebody told me.",Prabhupāda,"There are many cases. This is the statement in theBhāgavata. Dampatyeratimevahi:""Marriage relationship will continue only on sex power, that's all."" If one is weak in sex power, the marriage will be cancelled."
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:You must tell any other good messages, how actually a marriage is, can be for production of good progeny...",Prabhupāda,"Yes.Putrārthekriyatebharyāputra-piṇḍa-prayojanam.This, the first,piṇḍa-dānafor maintaining family. But nowadays nobody wants offspring. They want to kill to avoid botheration."
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:First they prevent, and if by accident it happens, then they kill it. And the medical profession help them.",Prabhupāda,Help them. Before my speaking you are saying. (laughter)
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:I am against it, no doubt. Once upon a time I used to be the doctor of all these so-called cinema actors and actresses, and you know their profession. And they are always falling prey of these sort of things, and they would come to me for relief, and I would refuse. So today I have none of them as my patient.",Prabhupāda,But you cannot relieve them.
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:No, I have taken a vow not to do wrong things. That is why I am here in your company. Otherwise I would be somewhere in... That is very common in Bombay.",Prabhupāda,"Not only Bombay, all over the world. Now it is imported in India also, to get relief of pregnancy. This is..."
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:No, because I don't drink. I don't know. I have not taken tea even in England during my education because I am not to take tea. I am totally teetotaler of the right way. The society is right from the beginning body conscious, more or less, we. We are not taught even during our age of education that we are not this body and something else. This was being done in the ancient times, our forefathers. When the boys were going to theguru, they were first taught this, that ""You are not this body; you are something else."" And here you are taught you are body so you have to take exercise.",Prabhupāda,"That is the first education, first instruction in theBhagavad-gītā,beginning ofBhagavad-gītā-dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā,tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Unless one understands that ""There is change of body and I am spirit soul within this body,"" he remains a cat and dog, and that's all.Dehātmā-buddhiḥ. Yasyātmā-buddhiḥkunapetri-dhātukesaevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13].So we are keeping this civilization—animals. How there can be peace? You cannot make several dogs, bring them together as nation, and they will live peacefully. It is not possible that ""You all dogs come here and feel nationally and be peaceful."" Will the dogs will be able to do that? Because you are dog, it is not possible."
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:(Hindi) They fight among themselves for nothing.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So they are keeping them cats and dogs by education, culture, and they want to be happy. How it is possible? First of all let them come to the standard of human being. Then there is question of peace and happiness. They are kept as cats and dogs, and how there can be peace? You cannot make any peace in the dog society. That is not possible.HareKṛṣṇa. So that consciousness can come only when one is spiritually educated. If he is simply engaged for satisfying the senses, material, then he remains a cat and dog. You cannot expect any peace."
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:I think the greatest damage done to this civilization of Aryans of India was by MacCauley, who introduced the British system of education.",Prabhupāda,But why you accepted that? (laughter) Why you accepted? Then why don't you accept? You should have refused.
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:Well, we were not there to refuse. We came afterwards. Our forefathers gave us...",Prabhupāda,"No, you can... Just like they are reforming. Their forefathers were drunkards, woman-hunters, (laughter) and they are reformed, the great-grandchildren. And we old men, we cannot do that."
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:I talk of MacCauley...,Prabhupāda,MacCauley may mislead you. Why you should believe?
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:He misled our forefathers.,Prabhupāda,"No, why you should be misled?"
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:Now we are going to lead them. Are you not leading them?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Your forefathers might have been misled, but why you will commit the same mistake again?"
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:Now we have improved upon the mistake and we are leading them, and we will lead them.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is not the fact. These boys, European, American boys, they were misled from the very beginning of their life, but how they are improving in spiritual consciousness? The thing is we are not prepared to take up our own culture. That is..."
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:That's right, sir. God must have some, something to fulfill.",Prabhupāda,"Take for example our big leader,MahātmāGandhi. He was supposed to be very good scholar inBhagavad-gītā.Did he ever preach that ""You are not this body?"""
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:I come from theashram.Yes, he did.",Prabhupāda,Then where is the question of nationalism?
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:He never says... When he went to England...,Prabhupāda,"Then why he asked the Europeans to go out? ""Quit India."""
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:Because they were exploiting poor people. There was a question of uniformity of people. There was no question of...,Prabhupāda,"No, there cannot be uniformity. On the bodily concept of life there cannot be any uniformity. That is a... When uniformity comes?Samaḥsarveṣubhūteṣu.When?Brahma-bhūtaḥ.Brahma-bhūtaḥprasannātmānaśocatinakāṅkṣati[Bg.18.54].Then uniformity. You have no knowledge ofBrahman. You are living like cats and dogs. How there can be uniformity? That is not possible. [break] Practically you see uniformity. Somebody is coming from Europe; somebody, American; somebody, African; somebody, Canada; somebody,Hindu; somebody, Muslim; somebody, Christian. How they are becoming uniform? Because on theBrahmanplatform. And if you remain in this bodily concept of life, there is no question of uniformity.Para...[break] ...nirmatśarāṇāṁ.This uniformity means ""I am envious of you; you are envious of me."" This is our position.Bhāgavatasays that this...Bhāgavataculture is meant forparamonirmatsarāṇām[SB1.1.2].So if you remain in the material platform, there is no question ofnirmatsara.Parautkarṣaasahanam.This is calledmatsaratā.The whole basic principle... Unless you come to the spiritual platform, there is no question of uniformity, peace, prosperity, nothing. Therefore our movement is ""Change consciousness. Come to the spiritual platform,Kṛṣṇaconscious. Then everything will be all right."" Otherwise not possible. What is that,māṁaprāpyaivamūḍhajanmanijanmani[Bg.16.20]?"
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:Aprāpyaivamāmeva.,Prabhupāda,"One who is notKṛṣṇaconscious, birth after birth he will be pushed into the atheist family, that's all.Mūḍhajanmanijanmani asureṣu[Bg.16.20].What is that verse?"
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:Māmaprāpyaadhāmam...,Prabhupāda,Adhāmamaṁgatim.So their result is they'll go down and down. That's all.
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:Then how he comes up?,Prabhupāda,ByKṛṣṇaconsciousness.
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:Tri-guṇasya.,Prabhupāda,"That is If you engage him in devotional service, immediately he is transferred to the spiritual platform. That is wanted."
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:Kāmaḥkrodhastadālobhas tasmādevam...Tri-vidhaṁnarakasya-dvāram.,Prabhupāda,"Ah! Yes. Yes. On the material platform, he... The human life is meant for spiritual culture.Athātobrahmajijñāsā.But they have rejected. They are simply busy.Athātodeha-jijñāsā.That's all.Dehātmā-buddhi."
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:I have got little point on this, that after all, the spirituality within you, namelyātmā,cannot remain independently without this body, so you have got to look after the body.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. That is not the fact. If you are actually spiritually advanced, you don't care for it.Dehasmṛtināhiyārsaṁsārabandhanakāhāntānra.It is just likeRaghunāthadāsaGosvāmī. He had no spiritual... er, material con... He was eating every alternate day a little quantity of butter. That's all. How he was living inVṛndāvana? So when one is perfectly on the spiritual platform, there is no bodily necessities. That is the sign. Therefore our civilization is to decrease the bodily necessities, not to increase. Control. Control, from thebrahmacārī, control, control, control. Ultimately completely control. That is perfectional stage.Tyāgena.What is that verse?"
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:Iśāvāsyamidaṁsarvaṁyatkincidjagatyam...[Īśomantra1].,Prabhupāda,"No,tapasābrahmacāryenatyāgenayamenavā[SB6.1.13].This is wanted.Tapasa.Beginning.Tapasyameans that controlling the senses. That istapasya.And thetapasyabegins..."
Dr. Patel:,Dr. Patel:(Sanskrit) ...brahma.,Prabhupāda,Yes.Tapasyameans... Beginning isbrahmācārya.Tapasābrahmacāryena[SB6.1.13].So where isbrahmācārya?
Dr. Patel:,"Dr. Patel:Brahmanpratiācaratiāśābrahmacārī.(?)All the senses.

Why don't you create life? Therefore he is no better than the dogs. He has no intelligence that ""How this combination of blood, urine, stool, and bone, and muscle can create life?"" They are thinking that a combination of matter can bring life force. That is the so-called scientists' theory. So these things are available in large quantity, so why don't you create life? Therefore <span class=""Italic"">go-<a href=""/d/kharah"" class=""d"">khara&#7717;</a>.</span> Their intelligence is not better than the cows and the asses from the very beginning. If they are not cows and asses, how they can think of that combination of these material things can bring in life? When a man dies, find out if there is scarcity of stool or scarcity of urine or scarcity of blood. Bring it and inject it. These rascals, they cannot do it, and still they are calculating urine examination, blood examination and this examination. (laughter) No, I am not saying. It is<span class=""Italic""> <a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a>.</span> (laughter) Take this dead man's body, and whatever urine and stool is there, examine, and then inject, and come him, let him back, come to life. Then I will understand that your examination of the stool, urine is perfect. This is common question. So long the soul was there, you are very expert to examine stool, urine and this and that. But when the soul is gone... Now the stool is there; urine is there. Why don't you examine and give life? This is our challenge.</div>
