Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Yes Śrīla Prabhupāda.,Prabhupāda,Who?
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Fools and rascals who won't take your books. Sometimes we convince them that the philosophy is very nice, and they agree when we use Lord Kṛṣṇa's words,dehino 'sminyathādehe[Bg.2.13],and they say ""Yes, I can understand that, but I don't need your book,"" or ""I would never read it."" We say, ""Well, no. Take it.""",Prabhupāda,"(chuckles) You ask them, ""So you want to remainmūḍhā?"""
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:We say, ""No, take it home, and some day you will read it."" They think they can find out on their own.",Prabhupāda,That is foolishness. They cannot.Māmevayaprapadyantemāyāmetāṁtarantite.
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Sometimes they will agree to everything we say, but they will not give a donation. They trust more the man on the T.V.",Prabhupāda,This is lake?
Balavanta:,Balavanta:In theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamyou say that theRāhuplanet is visible on the full moon night? TheRāhuplanet?,Prabhupāda,"No, when there is eclipse."
Balavanta:,"Balavanta:Oh, eclipse.",Prabhupāda,"Eclipse meansRāhuplanet comes in front. (Apparently reads sign:) ""No smoking?"""
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:""No swimming.""",Prabhupāda,Oh. Who is going to swim now? (laughter) [break]
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Once Balavanta was very sick when he was dealing with the politicians, and I heard that you said it was because he..., by touching them and associating with them, he accepted some of their sinful reactions.",Prabhupāda,(chuckles) I did not say. (laughter)
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:No?,Prabhupāda,But it may be.
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:So I was wondering. Sometimes our men onsaṅkīrtana,they are shaking hands...",Prabhupāda,"But you aresaṅkīrtana.You cannot be infected. [break] ...party is infected, then preaching will stop. If doctor is infected, then treatment will stop. Doctor is never infected. They have good precautions. Similarly, when you are engaged insaṅkīrtana,māyācannot touch.Māyāmetāṁtarantite.[break]"
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:...disciples and you accept ourkarmaalso. Is that correct?,Prabhupāda,Hmm.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:That is manifest sometimes in disease on your body?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:So our men also are going out and preaching...,Prabhupāda,The overloaded.
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:This way? Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Prabhupāda... [break]",Prabhupāda,"I am surprised how I have written so many, what to speak of them? (laughter) It is all Kṛṣṇa's mercy."
Dhīra,Dhīra-Kṛṣṇa:One professor the other day was trying to convince one of our boys that you were coming in the disciplic succession and were authorized to translate all these books.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is right."
Dhīra,"Dhīra-Kṛṣṇa:Because he was dressed and he didn't know that he was your disciple, so he was saying, ""Bhaktivedanta Swami, he is coming in a disciplic line straight fromKṛṣṇa. That's why he can speak on all these books.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is a fact. That authority I have got. That's a fact.Yasyadeveparābhaktiryathādevetathāgurau, tasyaite kathitā hyarthāḥprakaśānte[ŚU6.23].They become manifest, all the meanings of the Vedic literature.Yasyadeveparābhaktiḥ.(aside:) Don't come very near. [break] ...explaining last evening. Don't speculate, hear. That is the qualification. All others, they are simply speculating. How long their energy will go on, limited energy? How speculating will help them? It is not possible. It is condemned.Athāpitedeva, That is the Vedic description. The religious principles cannot be manufactured by anyone within this universe. It is the codes or laws given by God. That is religion. That means we have to know who is God, what is His desire, and we have to abide by that. That is religion. Just like a good citizen means he knows the government and the government laws and he abides by it. Then he is good citizen. Otherwise he is criminal. If he does not abide by the laws of the state, he is criminal. Similarly, if one does not abide by the orders or the codes or the laws of God, he is Satan or demon.Harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇā[SB5.18.12].Therefore anyone who is disobedient to God, he cannot have any good qualification. Andyasyāsti bhaktir bhagavatyaki&#241canāsarvair guṇaistatrasamāsatesuraḥ.And one who is devotee, abiding by the orders of God, he has got all the good qualification of God's. Therefore, the duty of the state, duty of the father, duty of the teacher, everyone, those who are guardians—they should teach their subordinate how to become faithful to God. This one qualification will make him perfect. That is not being done. Everyone is godless mostly. And therefore there is problems, chaotic condition. Nobody is abiding by the supreme law. Everyone is creating his own law. That is the trouble. So ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is meant for making the human society law-abiding citizen of the laws given by God. So that is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Kṛṣṇa, God, is giving, ""You do like this."" If we do like that... Or take even Bible. If we follow strictly, then we become happy. So, am I right or wrong? What is your opinion?"
Guest (1) (Indian gentleman):,"Guest (1) (Indian gentleman):You are very right in saying this because we cannot solve any problem. The problems keep on multiplying. When we solve one problem, there are twenty ahead of us.",Prabhupāda,"Our first problem is, because we have got this material body, eating. Everyone must eat. SoKṛṣṇasays in theBhagavad-gītā, annādbhavantibhūtāni:[Bg.3.14] ""If there is sufficient food grains, then both man and animal, they become happy."" Therefore our first religion is to produce food grain sufficiently to feed everyone.Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁvaiśya-karmasvabhāva[Bg.18.44].This matter has been entrusted to thevaiśyas.They should produce sufficient food and give protection to the cows for sufficient milk. Then the whole human society, animal society, will be happy. But we are disobeying the orders or the rules given by God. Instead of producing food, we are producing motorcars. And motor tires, motor parts. And so many other things. And therefore people are starving. The manual labor is being misused. We are disobeying the orders of God. Therefore we are unhappy. I have seen all over the world. There are enough space for producing food grains. And if we actually produce food grain, we can maintain ten times of the present population of the whole world. There is no question of scarcity because God has created everything complete.Pūrṇamidaṁpūrṇamādāyapūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate[Īśopaniṣad,Invocation].There cannot be any defect in the creation of God. We have created these defects on account of our disobeying the orders of God. God never said that ""motorcar-ādbhavantibhūtāni."" He never says. But instead of producing food grains, we are producing so many unwanted things. People's energy is engaged for... Just like in America or in every country, so much energy and resources are engaged for preparing war materials. And that means there must be war. And you must be killed; I must be killed. You will kill me; I will kill you. That's all. Therefore God says,cātur-varṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭaṁguṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ[Bg.4.13].The human society should be divided into four classes of men: the most intelligent class,brāhmaṇa;the next intelligent class,kṣatriya;then next intelligent class,vaiśyas;and the fourth-class men, who cannot becomebrāhmaṇa,neitherkṣatriya,norvaiśya,they are calledśūdra. Śūdrais meant for giving service to the others.Paricaryātmakaṁkaryaṁśūdra-karmasvabhāva-jam[Bg.18.44].So in this age, 99% people are engaged asśūdra,working for others. No independence. Otherwisebrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,they are independent. They are nobody's servant. But at the present moment, education means how to become expert servant. That meansśūdra.So we cannot expect any good things fromśūdra.That is not possible. Formerly there was monarchy, and the kings were calledrājarṣis,saintly king.Imaṁrājarṣayoviduḥ[Bg.4.2].These instruction are meant for therājarṣis,not for theśūdras.So therājarṣis,they would take instruction from superior authority,brāhmaṇasand Vaiṣṇavas, and they will accordingly rule over. And thevaiśyaswould produce food grains sufficiently and milk sufficiently. People would eat very nicely, and they keep their health fit and save time for understanding his relationship with God. That is perfect civilization."
Guest (2) (American gentleman):,Guest (2) (American gentleman):Who is aśūdra?Is it determined byjāti?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, one who is seeking service like dog. The dog goes door to door and moves his tail: ""Give me some food. Give me some..."""
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Is it determined byjāti,by birth?",Prabhupāda,No. His quality... He has no quality.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Spiritual type.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Not spiritual type, it..., material type. He cannot maintain himself independently. Nowadays people are being educated highly, but if there is no service he has no value."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):So thetamasi.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He has no value. I have seen one doctor of chemistry—he could not get any service—in Allahabad. His name wasRaghunāthaMitri(?), Dr.RaghunāthaMitri. So he was living at the cost of his father-in-law and making some soap and going to the shop for selling, doctor. That means he could not get any service. Now his independence was to manufacture some soap as ordinary man is doing. But he was chemist; he could not do anything. He could manufacture some soap. So in spite of high education, because he could not get a good job, he had no value. Just like the dogs. The dogs, if they do not get a master, nice, then street dog. He is lean and thin and no shelter, no..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):That is what is happening...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):...at the present time in this country to 10% of the people. They don't have jobs. They are let out. They can't...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. No, every country, every country. Now, just like you are highly educated. Your country could not give you service. You are coming here. And that isśūdra.One who cannot live independently, he isśūdra. Paricaryātmakaṁkaryaṁśūdra-karmasvabhāva-jam[Bg.18.44].Kalauśūdra-sambhavaḥ.In this age, everyone is practicallyśūdra,because nobody can live independently. So we are producing massśūdras.Therefore it is in chaotic condition. The Communist is the last word of theśūdras.The Communist philosophy is that ""We are worker. We have all the power. We must have all the power."" And that they are doing. And because they do not want to obey any authority, therefore they are denying existence of God. This is the tendency of the modern society. Not only they do not know what is God, and they are trying to disobey the orders of God. So practically there is no religion. And without religion human society is animal society.Dharmeṇahīnāpasubhiḥsamānāḥ.""Human being without any ideas of religion, God, he is no better than animal."" That is the difference between animal and human being. Animal eats, we eat; animal sleeps, we sleep; animal have sexual intercourse, we have; animal also defends, we also defend. These are common features. And what is the special feature? The special feature of human being—that he can understand what is God. So if he does not understand God, he is animal, because the distinction between animal and man is being avoided. So far other activities are concerned, they are the same as of human being and as of animal. But what is the distinction? The distinction is that in the human society there is an endeavor to understand God, and the animal society, there is no such endeavor. So when the so-called human society becomes devoid of God consciousness, it is animal society.Saevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13].So thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is meant for raising the human society to the real platform of human society, not to keep them in the animal platform. Try to understand God and love Him. This is the substance ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. So, yes?"
Guest (3) (Trappist monk):,"Guest (3) (Trappist monk):There's three of us here that are monks from Connear(?), Trappist monks, and you useHareKṛṣṇaas a way to God consciousness, while in our Christian tradition we use the name Jesus and we repeat it constantly and try to become conscious of him.",Prabhupāda,"Jesus, did he say... Jesus Christ, did he say that Jesus is the name of God?"
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Well, that's what Christians believe, yeah.",Prabhupāda,"No, is there anything mentioned in the Bible that Jesus is the name of God?"
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):I am not denying anything, but I'm saying that the meaning might be, that ""God and Jesus is one,"" is in a similar way that I and God is one.",Prabhupāda,That is fact. That is fact.
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Well, again it depends upon the belief of each individual.",Prabhupāda,"No, Jesus is described as son of God. Do you deny that?"
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Definitely, he is definitely son of God just as you and I are. But at the same time, as Christians... Of course it's a matter of belief.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. The son and the father, they are the same because son is born out of father. So how he can be different? In that sense it is one."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Yeah, I'm not denying the fact that God...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, try to understand. Just like here is a son, and here is a father. So there is no difference because the son is the expansion of the body of the father. So how the body and expansion of the body can be different? They are one. But still, in relationship, son is son, father is father. In relationship... Just like the mother is there, and her relationship with husband is different from her relationship with her son. In that sense, the son and the father, different, but in quality they are one because son is the expansion of the father's body. Therefore, simultaneously, they are one and different. That is real understanding. So if the son sometimes says, ""I am one with the father,"" there is no controversy because he is one in quality."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):This tradition of the names was a tradition that was developed for two thousand years, beginning with the monks, and which most Christians are really not aware of, that through thisjapaa man can come to consciousness of God.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, when one comes to God consciousness. And the relationship is ""God is great; we are subordinate."" Just like the father is the maintainer, and the son is maintained. Although the father and the son of the same quality, still, the relationship is the father is the maintainer, and the son is maintained."
Guest (6):,"Guest (6):You say that we are creatures, and we are subordinate to God, and I can understand that. Christ was not created.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, none of us are created. Just like in theBhagavad-gītā..."
Guest (6):,"Guest (6):Yes, I understand now. I spoke earlier with some people... In other words you say we are co-eternal with the father just as Christ is.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. We are all eternal. That isnityo nityānām.I have already explained.Nityameans eternal. There are two eternals: one chief eternal, God, and one subordinate eternals, they are plural number. God is one, and we are many. Father is one; the children are many. Similarly, both the father and the children are eternal. God is not created, and the childrens are not created. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,najāyatenamriyatevā.All these living entity, they are never created; neither they ever die.Nityaḥśāśvatamnahanyatehanyamāneśarīre[Bg.2.20].They are eternal, ever existing. Even after the destruction of the body, they are not annihilated. So God is eternal. That I have already explained. And we living entities, we are also eternal. How the son can be otherwise? If the father is eternal, the son is also eternal. The son cannot be... Because son is the expansion, part and parcel of the father, so all the qualities of the father are there. The only quality difference is the father maintainer and the sons are maintained. That means the father has got unlimited resources to maintain the sons, and the sons, they have no resources. They are maintained by the father. This is perfect philosophy. Otherwise, if you are self-sufficient, then why you go to church and beg father, ""Give us our daily bread""? That is... That means you are maintained. You are begging the father, ""Please maintain us."" So if the Supreme Being, who is maintaining millions of trillions of living entities, He is great, or the living entities who are maintained by God, they are great? Therefore God is great, and we are subordinate. This is natural conclusion. How you can go otherwise? If you are self-sufficient, why go to church and pray, ""God, give us our daily bread""? Are you independent?"
Guest (6):,Guest (6):No. I am a creature.,Prabhupāda,That is subordinate. Yes. Everyone is creature. He is the supreme creature.
Guest (6):,"Guest (6):I am servant of God. He is my life. Without Him, I can't live. I understand what you're saying, but I believe that our tradition from the Old Testament says that we were created by God.",Prabhupāda,"In one sense we are created, just like father creates the sons, not the sons create the father. In that sense we are created. (pause) So taking this word, that ""sons were created,"" so the father existed before our creation. So He is not of the same quality again."
Guest (6):,Guest (6):It's a mystery. We can only bow down before Him then.,Prabhupāda,"That is our business. (laughter) This word, ""creation,"" is applicable in this material world. In the spiritual world there is no creation, the father and the son existing eternally. When we come to this material world... Material world means it has got beginning, and it has got end. And spiritual world means there is no beginning, no end. That issanātana,eternal."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):The big bang theory and the steady state theory of the universe. And they have come up with a cyclical theory of the universe also, that there is a big bang and the universe expands and then comes back again, like in Vedic philosophy, they have onemantra...",Prabhupāda,"Hm,bṛhattvād bṛhannatvāditibrahma."
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):It's the alpha and the omega then. Swami, do you see a difference or a conflict between being a devotee of Jesus and a devotee ofKṛṣṇa? May one be both?",Prabhupāda,"A devotee means, real devotee means, he has no purpose for material gain. That is real devotee. Now we have to see what kind of devotee he is. There are two kinds of devotees: with purpose and without purpose. The ""without purpose"" devotee is pure devotee, and ""with purpose"" devotee, they are material devotee. That is distinguished inBhagavad-gītā,"
Guest (4):,Guest (4):I am not clear on what you're saying that for someone...,Prabhupāda,"It is clear. If you have got some motive and with motive you go to God, that is not pure devotion."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):It is wrong to petition God?,Prabhupāda,"No, it is not wrong, but it is not pure devotion."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):I see.,Prabhupāda,"Some way or other, if you go to God, that is very good. With motive or without motive, you have come to God, that is piety. That is better than to become impious. Impious men, they do not go to God. Just like nowadays nobody goes to church. Church are selling. Simply... Temples also. So now there are in India so many township development. They are constructing very fashionable houses, but no temples. Nobody is constructing temple. At the present moment everybody has become disinterested with anything religion and God. All over the world. That is degradation. Especially I am seeing in Bombay, that Juhu scheme, very nice houses are being manufactured. You have all seen. But nobody is constructing a temple. The modern economists, they say ""nonproductive endeavor""—means there is no income. Simply you have to spend money for maintaining the temple. So they are not interested in nonproductive things. So this is degradation of the human society. Either as Christian orHinduor Mohammedan, nobody is interested. A few may be interested. (pause)"
Balavanta:,"Balavanta:These are some psychologists, Śrīla Prabhupāda, from the University of Georgia. This is Michael Green(?). He's a lawyer in Atlanta helping us.",Prabhupāda,"So your question was devotee and not devotee, no? You questioned?"
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):I am a Christian, yes.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Your question..."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Oh, do I have a question? Yes, to my question, you answered it. Thank you.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, what is the question of Mr. Psychiatrist? Who is psychiatrist? You are? Come here."
Guest (7):,"Guest (7):No, I have just come to listen.",Prabhupāda,"Thank you. The other day in Caracas two or three psychiatrists came. His question was how to solve the problems. So our statement is that unless you treat the spiritual disease of the human society, then the problems will increase. It will be never be solved. The real disease is spiritual disease."
Guest (7):,Guest (7):The young children also? What about young children?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Young children should be educated from the very beginning about God consciousness or the science of God. We had the opportunity in our childhood. My father taught. And then, when I was grown up, my spiritual master taught. So for that reason we have got some sense. Spiritual education should be given..."
Guest (7):,Guest (7):Quite right.,Prabhupāda,"Nowadays small boys, they are learning how to smoke. When I was first in America, in Butler, so I saw small children, ten to twelve years or almost ten, nine. They were smoking. I was surprised because in India, at least, that is not allowed. I think there is law. If any boy smokes less than sixteen years old, he is punished, in India. What is that?"
Guest (7):,Guest (7):I am looking at him. He is ten years old.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, you can give him some book to see. (end) Try to understand this, that life is always there, as God is there. So these living entities, part and parcel of God, they are also there. That God has got multi-energies, potencies. Out of that, three potencies have been taken as very important.Parāsyaśaktir vividhaivaśrūyate[Cc.Madhya13.65,purport].God has multi-energy. Out of that, three energies have been taken as principal: material, spiritual, and marginal. The material energy is this material world. The spiritual world is the spiritual energy. And we living entities, we are also spiritual, but we are called marginal because we may live under the subjugation of material energy or spiritual energy. So the living entities, they are eternal. Their only position is marginal, sometimes manifested here, sometimes manifested there. So in the material world the living entities are already there. You haven't got to create. That is foolishness. It is never created. Simply in the material world it becomes manifest in four ways. Some of them are coming like trees, plants. And some of them are coming from perspiration... not coming, being manifested through fermentation, perception. And some of them are being manifested through eggs. And some of them are being manifested through embryo. The living entity were already there. Their struggle is going on, and they become manifest in the material world in four sources. In the spiritual world there is no such... They are eternally existing. There is no question of manifestation. So this is the science of living entities. What do they know? Therefore I say they are rascals. They do not know anything, simply trying to create. What is the creation? It is already there. But they do not know what is this, and still, they are scientists, they are advanced education. All rascal. They do not know. Therefore throughBhagavad-gītāwe say they are rascals.Mūḍhā.Now you tell thesemūḍhasthat ""My dear sirs, you cannot create; neither it is created. You find out how they are coming out, what is their source, who is the brain behind all this nature. That you find out. That is knowledge. So if you struggle for this and try to find out the original source of everything, then some day you may come to this platform,vāsudevaḥsarvamitisamahātmāsu-durlabhaḥ[Bg.7.19].Then you understand thatKṛṣṇais the source of everything, and then your knowledge will be perfect."" This is the...Vāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19].Whatever we see, that is, the source isVasudeva. Do you think this nice flower has come out without any brain, this nonsense philosophy? The so-called scientist will put some bombastic word, ""this, that..."" What is that explanation? Nobody can understand. It will be understood by them only. They will put some language in such a way that it is to be understood by them. Unless they explain, nobody will understand. They say it is automatically being done, nature. That's not the fact. Nature is an instrument. Just like this wonderful machine, computer. But still, there is operator. But they have no common sense even, that where is the machine that is working without any operator? Where is that machine within their experience? How they suggest that the nature is doing automatically? Nature is wonderful machine, but the operator isKṛṣṇa. That is real knowledge. Because the machine is working wonderfully, there is no operator? Where is that experience? Have you got any experience, Dr. Wolf, like that?"
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:No, sir, I don't.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, we have got any experience? You have got any experience? Then, why do you say nonsense, this? You have no experience, and you say something nonsense, ludicrous. They say ""nature."" What is the nature? Nature is a machine only. Just like the harmonium. It is also machine. But if one expert operator is there, it makes very melodious, oh, nice. So will the harmonium play automatically? And bring melodious sound? So they have no common sense even; still, they are scientist. That is our regret. They are less than common sense man. That you have to expose, that these people have not even common sense, and they are passing on as scientist. That you must protest because you are servant of God, you are servant of the scientist. Call them directly rascal. Let them defend that they are not rascal. He brought some scientist. I called him, ""You are rascal, you are demon. You are everything,"" (laughs) and he tolerated. That means internally he accepted that he is a rascal. (laughs) Actually they... They have no common sense even. So we are not scientist, but we speak from common sense. That's all. Yesterday or day before yesterday, I was talking on common sense on law points, so Rūpānuga said that ""You are bigger than lawyer."" I do not know that I am bigger than lawyer, but I was speaking on common sense. The difficulty is they are misleading. So many people are being misled by the so-called politician and scientist and... ButGandhisays... He has written so many nonsense things. One thing is that he said, ""I do not believe that there was anybody asKṛṣṇaliving ever.Kṛṣṇais of my imagination."" These things he has written. And he isMahatmaGandhi.Mahātmā'sdefinition is there in theBhagavad-gītā, mahātmānastumāṁpārthadaivīṁprakṛtimāśritāḥ[Bg.9.13].Mahātmāmeans devotee, who have understoodvāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19].But these rascal politicians, they have becomemahātmā.For politics, they can do anything, lie like anybody, and so many things. There was a big writer in Bengal. So he is giving evidence in the court... That's a comic. So he says, ""Do you think I am editor? I am pleader? I am prostitute?"" Means indirectly he is saying that they are prostitutes. As the prostitute can say anything, lies, for their profession, similarly, these people, the editor and the..., pleaders, they are like that. ""Do you think I am prostitute? Do you think I am lawyer? Do you think I am editor, newspaper editor?"" So take this formula from theśāstrasthat a living entity is never created. These rascals are trying to create living entity and spending money and going to hold big, big conference. So where is the question of creation? They are already created. Why this common sense do not come in their brain? Why?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Because they are illusioned.,Prabhupāda,Innocent?
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Illusioned, illusioned.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, illusioned, yes."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.They are so-called educated, doctors, but actually they have no knowledge. Simply they are bluffing, cheating. Where is the question of creation? So many millions and trillions of living entities are there, and they are making conference, ""How to create from chemicals?"" Just see this childish proposal. And wasting time and misleading person, and wasting hard-earned money of the state. And big, big foundation supplying them money. And if you ask, ""Give us some money forKṛṣṇaconsciousness,"" ""No, no, we are not interested in religion. We are interested in science, and this is the science."" All fools and rascal,mūḍhā.That is our test. Anyone who is notKṛṣṇaconscious, he is amūḍhā. Bas.We have got the test tube, thisBhagavad-gītā,namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥprapadyantenarādhamāḥ[Bg.7.15].So as soon as we see here is a man, if he has not surrendered toKṛṣṇa, ""All right, you aremūḍhā."" That's all. We haven't got to test him. Test tube is already there. So you tell thesemūḍhasthat ""Why you are wasting so much time and money to find out how to manufacture life? Then what are these life? How they have come? That is not a problem, that without your creation of life the world will go to hell. It is already there."" What do they say? ""Why they are trying to create life?"" What is their answer? What they will get it? The things are already there. Suppose there are so many motorcars, and if I manufacture one motorcar, so is there any great credit for me? The motorcars are already there. When there was no car, motorcar, the first man who manufactured, he had some credit. Who manufactured? The Daimler or somebody else? So he had some credit, ""Yes, you have done something, horseless carriage. People will get something convenience. That's all right."" But when there are thousands and millions of motorcars and creating accident only, and still, if I manufacture motorcar, what is my credit? What is my credit?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Zero.,Prabhupāda,"Zero. And they are going to put this zero, and they are going to have some big conference. So many people will come and spend money unnecessarily."
Mādhava,They want to make a better human being by making life themselves. They want to make it better.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is our proposal, that don't waste time. You are living entities. There are so many living entities. Now try to understand what is your actual constitutional position so that you may become happy and peaceful. This research should be done. Why they are going to waste time in this way, money and time? You can write to the organizer, sponsor of this meeting, that ""Why you are foolishly going to waste time like that?"" You can say, at least, ""MyGuruMahārājasays like this."""
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think if they're trying to create life they want to claim authorship. They want to say, ""We did it,"" but they do not understand that they will...",Prabhupāda,What do they want to claim by creating life?
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:Authorship. Originators. They want to be...,Prabhupāda,Origin is already there. How you can be originator? Already life is there. How you can be originator? That is your foolishness.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:They're simply trying to disproveKṛṣṇa. ""If I can do this,"" they're saying, ""if I can create life, then there's no need to postulate a God. I can be God.""",Prabhupāda,That means demon.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Yes, they want to be God.",Prabhupāda,So how we can respect the demons? We cannot.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:No. We'll not give them any credit.,Prabhupāda,"The other fools, they can give some respect, but we are not going to do that. We say, ""You will never be able."" You can say. This rascal, we can give some knowledge, that ""Your this attempt will be failure,"" because we know life cannot be created. How he will create? We know the formula,najāyate.So how this rascal will be able to create? I am not a scientist, but on the strength ofBhagavad-gītā'sassertion,najāyatenamriyate.""Neither it is created; neither it dies."" So if somebody wants to create, then at once we shall call him a fool. We have got test tube. Very boldly we shall say. Now let them prove that can he create. This is our position. SoKṛṣṇaconscious person, he has got very strong position. He speaks just whatKṛṣṇaspeaks. That's all, finished."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:They're like you described yesterday, when the scorpion comes from the rice. They think that when some living entity becomes manifest that he's being created. That's because the material...",Prabhupāda,That also he cannot do.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:No.,Prabhupāda,"How the scorpion is coming out of rice, that they do not know. Such a foolish person, he is scientist."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:They're thinking because they are able by different methods like synthetics and through chemistry that they can produce...,Prabhupāda,That is craftsmanship. That is not knowledge.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:But still, they are thinking because they can do, make the background a little...",Prabhupāda,"Just like if you paint a picture,rose, you are a painter, not that you know the knowledge. A painter is not a man of knowledge. Man of knowledge means he knows how things are being done. That is man of knowledge. Painter imitates some painting, that's all. He may be a good painter, but a painter is never taken as man of knowledge. I think, therefore, two departments, art and science. So this knowledge, this technical knowledge... Suppose one man has created an aeroplane. That is an art; that is not knowledge."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:So if they create some synthetic, that is an art.",Prabhupāda,That is an art.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Simply copying what is there.,Prabhupāda,"Just like a good cook is a good chemist. He knows how to mix up themaśālāsandgheeand makes very tasteful thing. So you can call him a good cook. The chemistry is nothing but mixture of different chemicals. That's all. There is oil. There is alkaline. You mix it very proportionately, and soap comes out, very useful."
Mādhava,"Prabhupāda, how can we explain to the scientists how gross matter is being produced from subtle matter and ultimately from life, from consciousness. Like if a scientist were looking at the creation occurring...",Prabhupāda,"Every scientist knows that originally the sky, the sound, and from the sound, then, what is? Air? What is the process of creation from subtle to gross?"
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:First the ether produces sound.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. From sound there is air, from air there is fire; from fire there is water; from water there is earth. This is earth, water, air, fire. And the sound, transcendental sound... As it is said in the Bible, ""Let there be creation."" And in theVedasalso, it is said,saaikṣata:""He glanced over."" That is to be found out, how from sound, from ether, sound is coming... I think that is already in the science. Is it not?"
Mādhava,You gave one example of television.,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Mādhava,You gave one example of television as showing that gross form comes from the ether. The transmission of television...,Prabhupāda,"But that now, this television, yes, coming. Sound is coming, some ethereal vibration and so many things. That you have to see. But in the Vedic knowledge is already there."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The question thatMādhavawas raising that came up in the questions that all the forms of these living entities which... All the species, their forms, their gross forms...",Prabhupāda,That is coming from mind.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, whether that has come all of a sudden.",Prabhupāda,No all of a sudden.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Or is it by gradual evolution from...,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Sadātad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ[Bg.8.6].As you are thinking always, so you are creating your next body."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:That still is not the answer. What we want is, at the time of creation of the material world, when all the species, 8,400,000 species...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They are all simultaneously manifested, just at once?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. But they are not manifested yet. Because it was like sleeping. When there is no creation and..., there is sleeping stage. Just like in the sleeping stage, even at the present moment, at night, the dog is sleeping, the bird is sleeping, the man is sleeping, the tiger is... Everyone is sleeping at night. But in the morning, as soon as they awake, they understand, ""I am tiger,"" ""I am dog,"" ""I am man,"" ""I am this,"" ""I am that."" Everyone remembers that ""I have to do this. I have to do that. I have to go there. I have to bring money from there."" All duties come immediately. So all these living creatures who are sleeping at night, but when there is morning, they again become the same. That is creation."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:But whenBrahmācreates, does he first of all create the aquatics, then the plants?",Prabhupāda,No.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:No, everything is at once. There's no gradual, it is all immediate.",Prabhupāda,"There is a process, from aquatics to this, this, this, this, but when there is creation, all of them come at once."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:So that process is transmigration of the soul.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:That is evolution.,Prabhupāda,"So in the last creation, if somebody could not come to the human form of body, now again he will be able to come. Therefore the creation is there. Another chance is given."
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:Śrīla Prabhupāda, there is the idea that matter comes from life.",Prabhupāda,"Life, yes."
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:I do not quite see how. I do not quite understand how matter can come from life.,Prabhupāda,"Just like a man, a mechanic, was sleeping, and as soon as he awakes, he again begins to manufacture motorcar. In the sleeping stage he was doing nothing. But awakened state, he begins his work. So therefore he is living being, and the motorcar comes from him, not that the motorcar was sleeping. He was sleeping, the living entity."
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:Can one assume that matter is a kind of energy?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, matter is also energy of God."
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:But which of the three types of energy does matter come from?,Prabhupāda,"Matter, material."
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:The material energy.,Prabhupāda,Yes. In the material world there is question of matter and spirit. In the spiritual world simply everything is spiritual.
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:Can we assume that energy itself, all three types of energy, are related to life?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:They emanate from life.,Prabhupāda,"FromKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays,ahaṁsarvasyaprabhavaḥ.Find out this verse.Ahaṁsarvasya.Sarvasyameans both matter and spirit. (Prabhupāda gets up and begins to leave room)"
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:We had some... Can we get you something, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Do you want something?",Prabhupāda,"No, I am going for..."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:""The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.""",Prabhupāda,That's it. He has found out the original source. There is no conference needed.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:This other question. During the day ofBrahmāat the end of everyManuthere's a partial devastation of the planets up to earth and celestial, right? Now, at that time there's like a flood, and the animals that are in their particular stage of transmigration of the living entities, their bodies are all killed. Now, at that time, when the end of that period is over, how are the bodies manifest? This is a question RichardPrabhuwas asking.",Prabhupāda,"There is no body. They are reserved in the Viṣṇu's body. And again, when there is creation, they come out. And therefore matter comes from the spirit. Matter is there, creation, matter. So take advantage of the matter. Just like the cloth is there. You cut it according (to) your body, and there is a coat. The spiritual body is already there. Now the matter is there. Now, from matter, you take. You make your body like a dog, like a ant, like a fish, like a tree, like this."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:So all the different species are created again simultaneously.,Prabhupāda,"That is... He died with that mentality. It is there. Just like we go to sleep, but all your mental activities are reserved. In the morning again you begin."
Mādhava,"Prabhupāda, you say that the living entity, he is thinking about a particular kind of body and a particular activity...",Prabhupāda,"Not particular body—particular desire. And according to the desire,Kṛṣṇais giving him facility through the material machine to give him a particular type of body. Just like one man is thinking of eating anything nonsense. SoKṛṣṇasays that ""You give him this body of hog. He can eat even stool."" That's all. You want to be naked, nudie? SoKṛṣṇagives him, ""So he is very much anxious to become nudie. Make him a tree. Stand up for five thousand years naked."" This is going on."
Mādhava,If I desire...,Prabhupāda,Whatever you desire.
Mādhava,If I desire something to appear here now...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you will remain here as insect."
Mādhava,"No, if I desire a plate ofprasādamto appear here...",Prabhupāda,Then you will go toVaikuṇṭha. (laughter)
Mādhava,How do I do it by just desiring? How is it done?,Prabhupāda,"By desire you are creating everything. Why these material varieties? You desire. In the spiritual world also, varieties. You desire. You want to serveKṛṣṇaas His friend, you want to serveKṛṣṇaas His lover, you want to serveKṛṣṇaas His father, as His servant, or you want to serveKṛṣṇaby supplying fruits and flowers, or riverYamunā. Everything, whatever you like,Kṛṣṇawill give you opportunity, in this material and the spiritual world."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:After complete annihilation and then, when the creation starts again...",Prabhupāda,There is no question of annihilation.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:I mean the material universe.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is manifest, not manifest. Not annihilation. The energy is there. Just like sometimes I become angry, and sometime I am peaceful. But that means anger is annihilated. Anger is there. It may be manifest at any time. There is no question of annihilation. You say like that because actually it isvyakta,avyakta:manifest and nonmanifest."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:We don't see it, so we say it's not manifest.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So during this time there are still living entities which are not manifested.,Prabhupāda,"Living are already there, but his desires are manifest or nonmanifest."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, the living entities are there, but they stop manifesting the different bodies.",Prabhupāda,"That is another thing, that you cannot see him without body. That is your defect. There are so many living entities in the air. You cannot see them. That is your defect. Therefore,Vedānta-śāstra-cakśuṣā:""You should see through theśāstra,not with your so-called eyes."""
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Śarīram puruṣoveda.(?),Prabhupāda,"Yes. Knowledge is throughśāstra,authority, not by our senses. That is not knowledge."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So that explains the... Sometimes some scientists ask that ""You are very sure, so sure about the 8,400,000 species.""",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They ask, ""How are you so much sure about 8,400,000 species?""",Prabhupāda,"Because we have heard from authority. As you are asking assurance from me, so I give you the knowledge from where I have heard. You want to hear from me. I have heard from authority. That's all. What is the difficulty? Why you are asking me? You want to hear from me. So I have also heard from authority. This is the statement. You take it."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So when... They say that there are some plants that can grow from just branches... We stick the branch in the soil. Then it just grows to another plant.,Prabhupāda,"The same thing. The living entity is there, but he is manifested in such a way. The same explanation. Just like there are many living entities within my body, and when this body is stopped, decomposed, they come out in different forms."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Are these living entities constant? They don't change any.,Prabhupāda,"Yes,nitya,nitya.Nityaḥśāśvato 'yaṁnahanyatehanyamāneśarīre[Bg.2.20].Why don't you see these references? It is never created. It is ever-existing, eternal. Only it appears to be temporary on account of accepting different material bodies. Therefore,paṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18].One who knows, he knows that he has changed his body, the same person. Just like father, mother knows. When a son becomes very stout and strong, the mother sees that same child. Others may be bewildered. One who has seen the child very long ago, now he has become robust build. He cannot say. And the mother says, ""He is my child, that child."" Sopaṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18]."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:""For the soul there is never birth nor death, nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.""",Prabhupāda,"That's all. So where is the question of creation? But because we have got these material eyes, we want to see everything through this material manifestation. We are seeing that he is dead, he is alive, he is born, he is this, that..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But that is the defect of the scientists. They only see the body.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is their defect. Therefore asses,go-kharaḥ.That is defined. Anyone who takes the body as the self, he is ago-kharaḥ,animal. And that is our protest, that ""You are animal; you are passing as very learned scholar, scientist."" That we want to protest. We want to expose them, that they are cheating people. They have no perfect knowledge; still, they are passing as scientist and big men and... That is our protest."
Mādhava,"Can we say that the living entity is there, and that he is the one that makes the molecules and the atoms come together to form a body just like the scientists give explanation? No? We can't?",Prabhupāda,"No. Because the living entity is there for the formation of his body, so many things are going on, action and reaction of the matter. That's all. That is depending on his desires. It is so subtle thing. He is desiring, and action, reaction is going on. And as soon as the living entity is not there, these action and reaction will stop. So they are trying to find out the missing thing. That missing thing is the living entity. That they do not know, foolishly. Just like a motorcar is running very nicely, and as soon as the driver goes away it stops. The machine is there, the everything is there, but this rascal mechanic, he comes, ""Something is missing."" And why something missing? But he does not know the missing part is the driver. He is finding out in the motorcar what is missing. The motorcar, everything is there. The hand is there, leg is there, heart is there, the intestines are there, everything is there. So they cannot explain. They say, ""Now the blood has become white."" Then make it red. Where is the difficulty? So they do not know what is missing; neither he'll take, I mean to say, learned instruction. That is their defect. Real thing is the driver is missing, but that they will not accept. They are so foolish, they are thinking that motorcar is running automatically."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Like a child.,Prabhupāda,"Like a child, yes. As the child will say, ""Oh, motorcar is going on."""
Sadāpūta:,"Sadāpūta:Śrīla Prabhupāda, would it be possible for them to make a body and have a living entity enter into it?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, there is yogic principle. They can enter into a young body and act as young man."
Sadāpūta:,"Sadāpūta:So a scientist then could claim he created life. He could... The way they talk, if he made a cell...",Prabhupāda,"First of all let them, these foolish rascals, let them understand what is the point who is missing. Then they will replace. They have no knowledge what is missing. They are so fool."
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:Śrīla Prabhupāda, they would not create. They would only imitate.",Prabhupāda,"That is not... It is never created. That is their missing point, that life is never created and they are trying to create."
Mādhava,"Their theory may be right about how the body forms, but they're missing the soul?",Prabhupāda,"Body forms... As soon as there is life, body will form by nature's arrangement."
Mādhava,May their theory be right? Like they say they come from amino acids and so many things. But...,Prabhupāda,That may be or may not be. Who cares for them? It is being already done.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:They're simply describing it.,Prabhupāda,"That is also... Because they have no knowledge, how they can describe?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:We're explaining that, just like Śrīla Prabhupāda's example that the driver in the car. So inside the... We also say that ""Yes, molecules are the ingredients to build the material bodies. But this does not mean that molecules are the living entities.""",Prabhupāda,That's it.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:There is a driver necessary.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is the first instruction ofKṛṣṇa.Dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāra...[Bg.2.13].Dehinaḥ.There is a living entity, driver, within this body. That is the first instruction. Unless one understands this simple thing, he is an ass. There is no knowledge. Because everything is based on something fictitious. This is the first thing one has to learn, the scientists, that there is the driver which is missing. Or the driver is moving this body. And if the driver is educated, then he can move this body toKṛṣṇa, back to home, back to Godhead. Then he becomes perfect. So we are educating the driver. We are not painting the tin car. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement."
Mādhava,Does the scientist actually observe something external to his mind or does he only observe...,Prabhupāda,Speculation.
Mādhava,Only in his mind.,Prabhupāda,"That's all. Just like you cannot see actually what is beyond the wall, and there is some sound. You can simply speculate, ""This sound is due to this. This sound is due to this. This sound is due to this,"" but you have no clear knowledge. This is called speculation. But if a man behind the wall says, this sound is... (end) ThereforeBhāgavatasays,satyaṁparaṁdhīmahi[SB1.1.1],the real truth, not this relative truth.Satyaṁparaṁdhīmahi."
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):Certainly I recognize that happiness does not come out of material prosperity. But material prosperity is also equally important for a good existence.,Prabhupāda,"Matter is also there, but matter means it is sometimes manifest, sometimes not. But life is always existing."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Unless the matter is touched by life, it cannot...",Prabhupāda,"Manifest. Just like this coat. It has not automatically come on my body. I have gathered it. Similarly, life is there, and it is gathering the matter to dress himself in a particular way. This is the varieties of life."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:We give that example that the difference between life and matter... We say that the difference is that the material living bodies... We live in a material body, but the material bodies, when a living entity stays inside a body, is fully automated, fully equipped.",Prabhupāda,"Life is enjoying or trying to enjoy the matter. Matter isprakṛti,and the living entity ispuruṣa.The chiefpuruṣaisKṛṣṇa, and we are trying to imitateKṛṣṇato enjoy. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Living entity is superiorprakṛti. Apareyam itastuviddhimeprakṛtiṁparaḥ.It is aprakṛti,but they are trying to becomepuruṣa.This is struggle for existence.HareKṛṣṇa. [break] ...trying to live within the water. They are not trying?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, yes. They have several plans to procure food from under the water, under the ocean. So they have all of these different schemes already started. Because the shortage of food on the surface of the earth... They say it's going to be very imminent in the coming future. So they have already started plans to make some food...",Prabhupāda,"Another nonsense. (laughter) They are not producing food, they are producing motor tires, and still they will say ""shortage."" Just see. Now, in this city of Atlanta or any big, big city, who is producing food? Everyone is eating; nobody is producing."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They will say it is produced by farmers.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, but..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Even their soap's called produce. (?),Prabhupāda,"Farmers are producing, and you are eating, but you are not producing. Therefore gradually your food will be shortage. You are depending on others. The farmers, they do not produce food for human being. They produce food for the cows."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:For the cows?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You do not know this? These rascals produce for the animals, not for human."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So the human beings are cows, then.",Prabhupāda,"No, no."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They eat the cows.,Prabhupāda,They eat the cows.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh. (laughs),Prabhupāda,"In the Bengali there is a saying,tomarayebhalovasa, mussulmane murgiposaya.You know this? That ""Your love is like the Mohammedans keeping chickens and love him."" That means ""The chickens be fat, and I shall eat it."" This is your love. They are keeping cows not for love, but for eating."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:No, I mean in the sense, farmers, that they produce the grains and vegetables. I was thinking in that line.",Prabhupāda,"Oh. That is somewhere in India still. But here they keep cows not for protection, for eating. [break] ...chemical. Life is already there."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:No, what they are saying is this, that the..., when they examine this body in the minute details—they call the molecular levels—they find only molecules. They don't see anything. For example, when they analyze the hand, they saw it—this is proteins, protein molecules, some fats, some carbohydrates, and they don't see anything else except molecules. And at the same time, when they study—they are called the biochemical pathways in the living cells—they find only these DNA molecules and the different molecules that carry out different activities. That is why they say that there is..., what we call life is just nothing but arrangement of these molecules in different ways. So that's why they say that ""Yes, life started actually from these molecules.""",Prabhupāda,So why they cannot produce life from the molecules?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They'd say that when science started or knowledge started, it takes some time. It cannot come all in a sudden.",Prabhupāda,So what is this knowledge? The molecules are already there.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:They say, ""Rome wasn't built in a day.""",Prabhupāda,"No, no. It was not known to you, but what was the harm? And what is the benefit when you have known it?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Because, they say, without knowing, it's not advancement of knowledge.",Prabhupāda,But you have not known it. You have not known it. You cannot claim that you are advanced. You are still foolish. Why you are claiming advancement? You have not known it.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yeah, but they are saying that ""In due course of time we are going to know it.""",Prabhupāda,"Ah, that is another foolishness. That we do not accept. You have not known it till now. You are foolish still. That you have to admit. ""In future you will be a rich man, and therefore you give me a post-dated check""—who will accept it? The foolish person will accept it, (laughter) that ""I am giving you the check, ten million dollars. You can take it after three million years (laughter) when I shall become rich."" It is a proposal like that. No intelligent person will accept that check."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But they say that ""About two hundred years ago, yes, we were foolish, about two hundred years ago.""",Prabhupāda,"You are still... Still you are foolish. (laughter) Why are you claiming intelligent? Admit it, that still you are foolish. ""We have known the molecules."" So what is the benefit of knowing?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Because that is a part of our man's inquiry, inquiry to know something. They don't want to be in darkness.",Prabhupāda,"The enquiry may be, but whether that enquiry is properly answered, that is the thing. Enquiry there is always. But where is the answer of the enquiry?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The answers, without knowing the goal, remain unanswered. (end)",Prabhupāda,"No, no, I shall learn. I shall..."
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:Śrīla Prabhupāda, they are used to cheating and so they couldn't believeKṛṣṇaeither...",Prabhupāda,Eh? Yes.
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:They are used to cheating and that's why they don't trust anything and anybody.,Prabhupāda,Hm. Sceptic.
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:Because they are cheaters themselves.,Prabhupāda,"Sceptic is not a scientist or a man of knowledge. He's unbeliever, that's all."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Sceptic can actually not have full knowledge, he can never have full knowledge.",Prabhupāda,No.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):The scientists, they cannot understand the (indistinct), they can understand what is the relationship between the world of ideas, the world of names, and the world that they see. How can we explain what that means?",Prabhupāda,"There is spiritual and material. The material is simply a phantasmagoria. It is the imitation of the reality. That is described in theBhagavad-gītā,fifteenth chapter, find out.Ūrdhva-mūlamadhah-śākham[Bg.15.1].That is called mirage. In the desert the animal is finding water. There is no water in the desert. But there is water, but not in the desert. That they do not know. So this is just like desert, this material world and everything is reflection like the water. But desert there is no water, it is only reflection.Tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁvinimayoyatratri-sargo 'mṛṣā.Tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁvinimayaḥ.Here everything is a transformation of three material things, fire, water, and earth, but it looks like reality. Just like the mirage, that is alsotejo-vāri-mṛdāṁvinimayaḥ,by reflection of the sun falling on the sand, and it looks like water. This is (indistinct). And the animal is running after water, running, running, running, when he becomes fatigued (he) dies. That's all."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):But here in the material world when we look for water, we actually take it and we can drink it.",Prabhupāda,That is not water! That you do not know.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):That's not water either.,Prabhupāda,Hm? What is that?
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Ūrdhva-mūlamadhah-śākham.""The blessed Lord said: 'There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is a knower of theVedas.' """,Prabhupāda,"Ūrdhva-mūlamadhah-śākham[Bg.15.1].Where you have experienced this tree? You have experience: a tree isadhaḥ,down, amūla,the root, is down and the tree is up. And here it is said,ūrdhva-mūlam,the root is up and the branches and twigs, they're down. Where you have experienced? Eh? Dr. Wolf, where you have experienced this tree?"
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:I know of it, yes.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:I know of the tree with the fruits up and the leaves down, yes.",Prabhupāda,What is that? What is that?
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:Right, right.",Prabhupāda,So reflection is not reality and therefore it is compared like that. It is not reality.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Otherwise it would be satisfied.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:If it was real we would be satisfied with it.,Prabhupāda,Hm.
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):So the scientists are engaged in minutely analyzing this mirage, the reflection. They're wasting their time.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, now you are right."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:We have some specific topics that we wanted to have Śrīla Prabhupāda's instruction about these things that we are going to write. So shall I discuss them very briefly?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The title is ""The Origin of Life and Matter,"" and then there will be a sub-title called ""Life is a Manifestation of Life Only.""",Prabhupāda,Mm?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:""Life is a Manifestation of Life Only."" I mean ""Life Comes from Life.""",Prabhupāda,Mm.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is the sub-title.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Then we have some tentative titles of the chapters and the first one is ""A Unique Differentiation between a Living Spade(?) and a Non-living Matter.""",Prabhupāda,Mm.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:This will be tentatively planned to write by me and the second chapter is ""The Eternality of the Living."" That's also by me. And the third chapter is called ""A Look at the Natural Laws Regarding the Origin of Life and Matter."" In this there are different sections. First section is quantum mechanical demonstration that will be written by Jad (?)Prabhu, he's a mathematician.",Prabhupāda,Oh.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:And the second part of it...,Prabhupāda,"That theory, mathematics, you presented..."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, this is...",Prabhupāda,His.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, it's his.",Prabhupāda,So it is very nice. You have dedicated toHareKṛṣṇa. Then?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The second one is ""Order Cannot Arise from Disorder."" This will be based on mathematical arguments.",Prabhupāda,Very good.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is also Jad Prabhu's (indistinct).,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:And third one is ""The Statistical Disproof of Darwin's Theory."" This is on advanced mathematics. That also Richard Prabhu's duty.",Prabhupāda,Very good.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:And then on fourth chapter we have a section called ""False Theory,"" namely that life originates from matter. This will beMādhavaPrabhu's...",Prabhupāda,Life originates from matter?
Devotee:,Devotee:False theory.,Prabhupāda,"About false theory. Very good. (laughter) Very good, it will be very nice. You have all Kṛṣṇa's blessing, do it nicely."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Then from fifth chapter it will be evolution versus transmigration.,Prabhupāda,"Mm, yes, very good."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:And explanation. That will be written by me.,Prabhupāda,Mm.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:And then on the sixth chapter there will be a topic called ""Molecular Evolution."" This will taking the jumbles of the scientific findings, but we use it as a jumbles and turn around toKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So that will be by me and...,Prabhupāda,"That isvṛścika-taṇḍula-nyāya.Is not that? The last chapter, what he means?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, this one?",Prabhupāda,Mm.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:This is molecular evolution.,Prabhupāda,Ha. Molecular evolution takes place when the light is there.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Actually when they say molecular evolution, it talks only about molecules. They don't talk about life. Because they don't know what life is.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So they talk only about molecules. That everybody knows that molecules are around and it's evolving. But they don't know that there is life. They take...,Prabhupāda,"That is their defect. That is their defect, we want to educate them on this point."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:And on the seventh chapter there is that Prabhupāda's, that theory ofacintya-śakti.",Prabhupāda,Mm.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That will be a collective effort of all theprabhusfrom the movement.,Prabhupāda,"Yes,acintya-śaktiis there, within our body."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:We want to present it in some sort of very good arguments, foundations are there. It will be our collective effort.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:There was another devotee,Jñānadāsa, in Germany, who is a graduate from Oxford University, their school. And we have invited him to come to this meeting but he did not respond. Maybe he will come and help in the future.",Prabhupāda,"Mm, yes."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, yes. His topic was classical, statistical (indistinct) proof. That was allotted toJñānadāsaPrabhu, to Germany. (indistinct)Mahārājasent a telegram, and I also personally wrote a letter saying that he should participate in writing (indistinct). He has a (indistinct) background, he told me (indistinct).",Prabhupāda,"Yes, this is nice, attend.Kṛṣṇawill help you. They are wiping outKṛṣṇa, and your business will be to establishKṛṣṇa. Hm."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:1.1?,Prabhupāda,"Take the index, otherwise how you will find out?"
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:The index.,Prabhupāda,"This I want. You are nicely educated. Now by dint of your education, you prove that background isKṛṣṇa, that's all. Then your education will be perfect. Otherwise you are one of these fools and rascals, that's all. The particular type of education, mathematics, chemistry, physics, what you have learned after working so hard, now you should by your educational-departmental education—you prove that the background isKṛṣṇa. Then your education is perfect. That is the verse,idaṁhipuṁsastapasaḥśrutasyavā."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:,Prabhupāda,Purport.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Yes. ""Human intellect is developed for advancement of learning in art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, politics, etc. By culture of such knowledge the human society can attain perfection of life. This perfection of life culminates in the realization of the Supreme Being,Viṣṇu. Theśrutitherefore directs that those who are actually advanced in learning should aspire for the service of LordViṣṇu. Unfortunately persons who are enamored by the external beauty ofviṣṇu-māyādo not understand that culmination of perfection or self-realization...""",Prabhupāda,"Nature,viṣṇu-māyā,nature. They are bewildered simply by seeing the nature. Then?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Viṣṇu-māyāmeans sense enjoyment which is transient and miserable. Those who are entrapped byviṣṇu-māyāutilize advancement of knowledge for sense enjoyment. ŚrīNāradaMunihas explained that all paraphernalia of the cosmic universe is but an emanation from the Lord out of His different energies because the Lord has set in motion, by His inconceivable energy, the actions and reactions of the created manifestation. They have come to be out of His energy, they rest on His energy, and after annihilation they merge into Him. Nothing is, therefore, different from Him, but at the same time the Lord is always different from them.",Prabhupāda,"Absolute, that is absolute."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:""Therefore, all the sages and devotees of the Lord have recommended that the subject matter of art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology and all other branches of knowledge should be wholly and solely applied in the service of the Lord. Art, literature, poetry, painting, etc., may be used in glorifying the Lord. The fiction writers, poets and celebrated litterateurs are generally engaged in writing of sensuous subjects, but if they turn towards the service of the Lord they can describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Vālmīki was a great poet, and similarly Vyāsadeva is a great writer, and both of them have absolutely engaged themselves in delineating the transcendental activities of the Lord and by so doing have become immortal. Similarly, science and philosophy also should be applied in the service of the Lord. There is no use presenting dry speculative theories for sense gratification. Philosophy and science should be engaged to establish the glory of the Lord. Advanced people are eager to understand the Absolute Truth through the medium of science, and therefore a great scientist should endeavor to prove the existence of the Lord on a scientific basis. Similarly, all other branches of knowledge should always be engaged in the service of the Lord. In theBhagavad-gītāalso the same is affirmed. All ""knowledge"" not engaged in the service of the Lord is but nescience. Real utilization of advanced knowledge is to establish the glories of the Lord, and that is the real import. Scientific knowledge engaged in the service of the Lord and all similar activities are all factuallyhari-kīrtana,or glorification of the Lord.""",Prabhupāda,"That is perfection. If you can write this book nicely all together, it will be a great service toKṛṣṇa. AndKṛṣṇawill bless you and help you."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Will you read the rest of the chapters?,Prabhupāda,Mm? Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Then in the eighth chapter there will be...,Prabhupāda,Just make that Dr. Agarwala also interested.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, he can...",Prabhupāda,"He is the also scientist, professor of physics."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:""Defects and Errors in Scientific Research,"" it will be a title and we will find out all the mistakes that normally found in scientific research. That will be written byMādhavaPrabhu.",Prabhupāda,"And add ""and how to make it perfect."" Find out the defects. Don't be, what is called...?"
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Negative.,Prabhupāda,Negative only.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:No, we want to bring the, our four defects in our sense perception.",Prabhupāda,Sense perception is defective.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, there are four defects.",Prabhupāda,"And if you go beyond the sense perception, that is perfection."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That will beMādhavaPrabhu's duty.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Then on the ninth chapter there will be a topic, ""The Ultimate Research,"" (indistinct) research.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That...,Prabhupāda,Ultimate research is to find out the brain.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Kṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Absolute. Then there is no more defect. Everything is perfect. That is stated,dhāmnāsvenasadānirasta-kuhakaṁparaṁsatyaṁdhīmahi.Nirasta-kuhakam,where there is no defect, that isvaikuṇṭha-dhāma.Dhāmnāsvenanirasta-kuhakaṁparaṁsatyaṁdhīmahi.The absolute truth, we offer our respectful... That is the beginning ofBhāgavatam.Nirasta-kuhakam,where these defects cannot enter. Just like sunshine, in the sun, darkness cannot enter. There is no possibility of darkness going there. Is it possible? So similarly, inKṛṣṇa,kṛṣṇasūrya-sama;māyāandhakāra[Cc.Madhya22.31],there is no question of defect there."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:In this respect I wanted to phase this on (indistinct) that ultimate research, thatbrahma-jijñāsā.",Prabhupāda,"Brahma-jijñāsā.That is beginning of knowledge, what is the absolute truth?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is the research topic.,Prabhupāda,"Mm. Now this subject matter should be taken up seriously in the human form of life, that is the suggestion.Atha,atha,ataḥ,now you have got this human form of life, therefore you discuss about the absolute truth.Paraṁsatyaṁdhīmahi.Yes?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Next one is, next chapter is ""Matter Originates from Life."" That one ofDāsa(?) Prabhu's. And on the eleventh chapter there will be (indistinct)...",Prabhupāda,"Matter is a manifestation of life's energy. We can daily experience. The matter, hair is growing. Cut, again growing. Why? Because there is life. Dead body, hair never grows. Is it not?"
Mādhava,Well the scientists will say it's just recombination of matter.,Prabhupāda,"Whatever it may be, when there is body dead, no hair grows."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That's a nice example.,Prabhupāda,"They can use some bombastic word but we layman, we see this is the position. And you do not know how it is being done but the energy is there in you. That is calledacintya-śakti,inconceivable energy. That is there. Now you shave every morning and next morning, again millions of hairs. You do not know how it is being happening. But it is happening, and this is calledacintya-śakti.FromKṛṣṇasuch big, big things are coming out. EvenKṛṣṇamay not know butKṛṣṇahas got the inconceivable by which it is coming. The same example."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:People will speculate so many theories as to why the hairs are coming out but then after some time they will see that theory is wrong they'll have to present a new one.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is their rascaldom."
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:False ego.,Prabhupāda,That's it. So give something.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The last chapter is entitled ""Intellectual Amalgam, Psycho-social Implications."" That will be Rūpānuga...",Prabhupāda,What is it?
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:It was their idea. In a book like this there has to be some social conclusion as to the effects of such atheistic theories.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, the people are being misguided. That we want to stop. They have got this human form of body, that is an opportunity to understand himself and God and act accordingly. Now they are being misled. It is a social disservice. Cheating. In the name of scientist, they are exploiting this innocent person, taking their money and spoiling it without any good result."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:My idea is that they are... Actually the scientists are preaching void. They are preaching to the people...,Prabhupāda,"But what is the necessity of preaching void? Void is void, that's all."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:There's nothing to say about that. But because they're saying that, the people think that at the time of death there's nothing, so they want sense gratification. So the scientists are selling them their gadgets. They're selling them cars and things to keep them in sense gratification.",Prabhupāda,"We can see when a man is in coma, he cries, he suffers. Before death when a man is in coma sometimes tears come. Now why he says there is nothing? Imperfect knowledge, that's all. Misguiding people."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:The last chapter's the nicest.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The last chapter is—that Śrīla Prabhupāda suggested—that was ""The Original Idea isKṛṣṇa.""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is the concluding chapter. That will be a collective effort from the...,Prabhupāda,"That's nice, do it. Sincerely pray toKṛṣṇaand He will give intelligence. Now write nicely.Teṣāṁsatata-yuktānām,dadāmibuddhi-yogam[Bg.10.10],Kṛṣṇawill give you intelligence.Yenamāmupayāntite,such intelligence which will help him to come back home, back to Me."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:If we are strong in the principles, then we will have the intelligence to write this book.",Prabhupāda,"Yes,Kṛṣṇawill give the intelligence. What is that?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:""To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.""",Prabhupāda,That's nice.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Buddhi-yoga.,Prabhupāda,Hm.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:It will take us some time.,Prabhupāda,"It may take, that is... But do it very nicely. How many pages will it be?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:We plan about 500.,Prabhupāda,That's nice. Then we shall immediately publish. What (is) the title you have given?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:It's called ""The Origin of Life and Matter."" The origin of everything. When one talks about the life here in the material world, one cannot leave matter. Because the scientists, what they are doing, is the materialists taken it for granted. They do not ask who made this matter. So they've started at... ""Oh, matter is already, given by nature."" So they'll take the matter and then start life. That is their increasing. So we want to bring it that matter is also from life.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:That's like saying the car produces the driver. That's what they're thinking.,Prabhupāda,The car necessitates the driver's service. Otherwise car is useless.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Neither is the driver dependent on the car for his existence. He doesn't need the car. The car needs him.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee:,"Devotee:They also say that the car created itself somehow or other, the metal and everything.",Prabhupāda,That is not the fact. Car requires the help of the driver.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:I have interest for these journals, say life, origin of life, that started from last year. So here the international scientists from all over the world, they have combined together and then they formed this, this is all chemicals, this. And they're a big group.",Prabhupāda,So why don't you protest?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, that's what we're starting the background.",Prabhupāda,"Refute their arguments, then it will be nice.Aiye(Hindi—Prabhupāda greets guests and asks which province of India they come from and they reply Punjab). How long you are here?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):There are a number of projects and there are a number of disciplines in which people work. Mine is experimental nutrition.,Prabhupāda,So you are also believing that life comes from matter? (laughter)
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But I think you have assumed that Darwin's theory or theory of evolution is already there and even to study something intermediate, higher levels, evolution is all right but...",Prabhupāda,Basic means evolution.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But they want to study more some of the intermediate stages like this metabolism in some...,Prabhupāda,"Mother's, mother's body? No?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):What I can do is to study the growth and differentiation of the nervous system, different parts of the nervous system and how it is affected by lack of protein in the diet of the mother.",Prabhupāda,That is medical science.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Because all over the developing world there are millions of mothers who would not get any great quantities of protein while they are pregnant. In the first instance before they are pregnant, they are not nutritionally prepared for having another burden of a baby inside their body, and without that adequate preparation when they become pregnant, this is a double stress on their physiological systems. And we would like to see how the baby gets affected.",Prabhupāda,"So if by chance there is baby, killing. Is that the conclusion?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, our conclusions just say that there is a critical period in the development of the baby that if it does not get any good nutrition at that time, then he's likely to be retarded in many respects.",Prabhupāda,Therefore?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):The number of cells that he comes equipped with is less than the normal and number of enzymes that must be equipped in certain proportions do not come in the right proportion so that the later functioning is not to the mark. Therefore full and cognitive ability is very much affected. So what we are trying to do is—hopefully in the next five years we can do it—is to define a critical period. We do not know yet what is a critical period. We are talking of a very large time, large span of time, but most probably it is only a few months period in which if the baby is supplied very well, at least then our system will not be affected. His body may be affected. By the lunch program in a school they have been able to improve very much the physical characteristics of the body but if the mental mischief has been done, it is done. It cannot be corrected later on. So...",Prabhupāda,"No, now this killing of the babies are going on."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):You mean abortions.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, and not abortion, killing, regular killing. Sometimes they kill, the doctors. So it is going to be supported, like that, scientific research?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, Swamiji, it's a matter of opinion when the mentally fetus becomes an individual. If you think that as soon as it is conceived, it is an individual—of course it is because it's going to grow into one—then of course it's killing.",Prabhupāda,You believe that the child in the womb is not individual?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, I don't have any personal thoughts about it though. But I think if a woman thinks that she is not suited as a mother...",Prabhupāda,Then why she has sex?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, in this present world I think, you know, sex is not for procreation, it is more for fun. I think ninety-nine percent of the couples who indulge in sex do not think of children at that time.",Prabhupāda,But that is sinful.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):That's true. But this is also true that ninety-nine percent people when they indulge in it...,Prabhupāda,"Ninety-nine percent may be all rascals and fools, that is not true."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):For the common, I think masses, some practical means are needed rather than...",Prabhupāda,"Practical is that ourśāstrasays thatpitānasasyājjananīnasāsyāt,namocayedyaḥsamupeta-mṛtyum.The idea is that one should not become a father, one should not become a mother, unless they know how to make his child immortal. Because soul is immortal but he is entangled in this material body, therefore death takes place. Actually soul is not born,najāyatenamriyatevā.So this process is going on, transmigration of the soul from one body to another,tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].The father and mother should be so enlightened and educate the son in such a way that this is the last acceptance of material body.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaiti[Bg.4.9],he may not accept again this material body. If the father and mother is determined in that way, then they should become parents, otherwise no."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Swamiji, I think, you know, you are very right but we are the one in India who face this problem the most. We should not have gone to this stage which we are, six hundred million people. I think the most of us are, you know, procreating without any thoughts about the next generation.",Prabhupāda,"Then that is not for Indian and European, that is for everyone. That ignorance and knowledge is everywhere. It is not the Indian or American. That ignorance is everywhere."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):But Swamiji, while the family norm here in the western countries is 2.3 children per couple, we still have a family norm of about six children per family. You know I think there are a lot of cultural factors that are...",Prabhupāda,"No, that shastric injunction is, that is spiritual restraint. Therefore one should train himself when to have sex life or when to become father, when not to become. That education... Not to become like animal, dogs and cats, whenever there is sex desire, we must have. Therefore in theBhagavad-gītā,it is said,dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi.Find out this,dharmāviruddhaḥ."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Swamiji, do you recognize that India does need some method at this point...",Prabhupāda,"Why you are speaking of India. Everyone needs, all over the world."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Because we are the most unfortunate one that with only...,Prabhupāda,You are unfortunate because you are now following misleaders. You do not follow the real leader.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):We have only 2.4 percent of the land area and we support 16% of the human population. You see this land...,Prabhupāda,That is due to your ignorance. You have followed the so-called rascal politicians. You have not followedKṛṣṇa. Therefore this misfortune is there. Misguided. Now...
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Everything comes from the mother earth. We are in very short supply of things.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. No shortage. That is everything supply. You have got the Vedic knowledge. You don't take care of that. You now manufacture your own knowledge. Now there is knowledge, thisBhagavad-gītāis perfect knowledge, but even a political leader likeGandhi, he says that I don't believe that there was anybody likeKṛṣṇaliving. This is your leader. All theācāryas,previousācāryas,big, bigācāryas,Śaṅkarācārya, big, big, stalwart, learned, they have acceptedKṛṣṇa. NowGandhisays, ""I don't believe."" Now you are guided byGandhi, you are not guided by theācāryas.That is your misfortune. You are not guided byKṛṣṇa. You are guided by Dr. Radhakrishnan. That is the misfortune.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31],one blind man is being, is following another blind man. That is going on. That is going on all over the world, not only in India."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I thinkMahatmaGandhifollowed theGītā,all these...",Prabhupāda,But he did not believe inKṛṣṇaand he followedGītā.Just see.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"No, just try to understand the psychology. He says plainly that I do not believe there was anybodyKṛṣṇa, living ever. And he's following Kṛṣṇa's instruction. Just see his position."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, he must have also answered this question.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, there is no questioning. If you do not believe in somebody, how you are reading His book of knowledge?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):That's my point also.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, so therefore... This kind of leader we are following, contradictory. That is our misfortune."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Swamiji we are not following any person but we do see the realities all around the world.,Prabhupāda,"Realities... If you have no knowledge, what do you know about reality? If you have no knowledge, then what is reality, what is non-reality, how can you know? If your knowledge is imperfect, then how you can say reality? Suppose beyond this wall you cannot see, and how you can speak of the reality beyond this wall? That is misfortune. You do not see what is there clearly, and you are speaking on the reality. Your senses are defective. What do you know about reality?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):In the spiritual level yes, we are very blind.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is reality."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):But at the material level, at the level where people eat their food and live their lives, I think...",Prabhupāda,"That is also on account of presence of the spirit soul. Actually it... Whatever little you are doing on account of presence of the spirit soul, as soon as the spirit soul is gone then your body and senses are simply lump of matter. So you are working with that lump of matter on account of presence of the spirit soul. Therefore that is more important. To understand what is that spirit soul, how it is working, what is his position, that, that is real knowledge. ThereforeKṛṣṇabegins in theBhagavad-gītā,first lesson, about the spirit soul,dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā,tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].So you are studying thedeha,that we are discussing just now. One is studying the motor car but he has no knowledge of the driver."
Dr. Wolf:,"Dr. Wolf:Śrīla Prabhupāda, may I venture very humbly to this opportunity of saying something I've experienced so much with people, that they would say, ""Oh yes, we are ready to respect the spiritual values, but we live in this real world, in this material world and so we would rather not have the spiritual values interfere with it, settle everything in the material sense.""",Prabhupāda,"No, they, what they are saying, ""real world,"" that is unreal."
Dr. Wolf:,Dr. Wolf:They don't realize that.,Prabhupāda,"No, their knowledge is so imperfect, they're takingasatyeresatyakorimāni. Asatyere,you understand Bengali?Asatyeresatyakorimāni, accepting the untruth as truth.Asatyerenitāi-padapāsariyā, ahaṅkāremattahoiyānitāi-padapāsariyā, asatyeresatyakorimāni,by forgetting our relationship with God and being proud of their so-called... [break] That motor car is not your life. That is being misguided. Everyone is thinking that this body, motor car, is everything. But within, the driver, he's starving. So how long he'll carry on this motor car. So first of all take care of the driver who will protect this motor car nicely. And if the driver is a nonsense, he's starving, then how can I expect the car will go very nicely. It will create disaster. Disaster means... Suppose you have got very nice car, Cadillac or, many good cars there are, Rolls-Royce, and he smashes. Then he'll get ordinary car. This human body is smashed... [break]...hāntara-prāptiḥ,you enter into the dog's body, finished. That is not in your control, that is God's control, nature's control.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13],it is not under your control or so-called science.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ[Bg.3.27],kāraṇaṁguṇa-saṅgo 'syasad-asad-janma-yoniṣu[Bg.13.22],these things are there."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Do you think Swamiji, the scientists would be able to create life as they...",Prabhupāda,"That I was discussing, that is foolishness. That is—I was discussing—life is never created, life is already there. The body is created. So they are going on on a wrong theory."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):I think our definition of life is a little different.,Prabhupāda,"You may define differently, that is your concern."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):We are talking about a protoplasm, something that moves. It may not have the soul, it may not have any...",Prabhupāda,"""May not have,"" that means you have no real knowledge, ""may not have."" ""May not have,"" that is not knowledge. I say, ""May have."" Then what is the difference between you and me? ""May not have,"" that is not knowledge. That is simply suggestion, speculation."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Want me to give examples...,Prabhupāda,"Therefore we have to take knowledge from the perfect.Kṛṣṇasays, ""Yes,dehino 'sminyathādehe[Bg.2.13]."" You have to take that knowledge. You cannot say you are perfect and you'll say, ""May not have."" And what is this knowledge, ""May not have""? Say definitely and prove it, scientifically. That is knowledge. ""Perhaps,"" ""May not,"" ""May be,"" these are not knowledge."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Just to give one example, these days the science experiments have conclusively done that a particular egg can be in the body of the womb, can be manipulated into either a male or a female.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. We say the soul is within the body so you can make it male or female, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. We are not concerned with male and female, we are concerned with the soul."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Science does manipulate life.,Prabhupāda,"Maybe, even if you manipulate, then what you have done? You cannot create the soul, that is not possible. If you manipulate life then give the dead body again energy to rise up. Then we shall (admit) that you can manipulate. Otherwise it is false. If you are so expert in manipulation, then give the dead body life again. That is my request. If depend on others and you manipulating, this false knowledge will not help."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Swamiji, what actually I was coming to, most humbly, cannot spread to the (indistinct) science go together. It's not...",Prabhupāda,"No, if science is really science, that is helpful. If science is based on wrong theory, then what is the use of that. Everything is wrong. So many mathematical calculation, if there is any item wrong, then whole thing is wrong."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):So we are all moving in the darkness, ignorance, to begin with.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that if you admit then you will get knowledge. But that is not the position. You are falsely proud that you are very advanced in knowledge."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No Swamiji, no...",Prabhupāda,Then you are qualified.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Even for a small experiment, I don't pretend that we know anything, whatever it is.",Prabhupāda,"Actually that is the position, therefore our business is to surrender toKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇademands that,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].ThenKṛṣṇawill give you intelligence how to become perfect."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):That we believe in.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. We are not perfect. We can speculate only and that is not perfection. ""Maybe,"" ""perhaps,"" like that. No definite knowledge. The definite knowledge you can get fromKṛṣṇa, the perfect. Therefore all theācāryasacceptKṛṣṇa. We have to follow theācāryas, ācāryopāsanam.So in India all theseācāryas,Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya,ViṣṇuSvāmī, LordCaitanya, they acceptKṛṣṇathe supreme absolute. Why you should not? Are you more than theseācāryas?Then? That is the defect of modern education, they manufacture education although they're imperfect. They have no the common sense that ""I am imperfect, how I am manufacturing education and becoming teacher. My becoming teacher is cheating because I have no perfect knowledge."" Knowledge means it must be perfect, not ""maybe,"" ""perhaps."" This is not knowledge. Definite knowledge."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But to bring some message of truth to the people all over the world which are...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, the message is there, Kṛṣṇa's message."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Four billion, we need some people who will say, ""I am the teachers.""",Prabhupāda,"No, that we are teaching, that you takeKṛṣṇaas the authority. Don't go to the rascals. All problems will be solved. But they are going to the rascals, instead of going toKṛṣṇa. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):You mean Swamiji then that all scientific efforts, whatever they are, should be stopped altogether?",Prabhupāda,"No, not stopped. Just like you have got ordinary car and you purchase a Rolls-Royce car. The business is the same. It is simply an artistic improvement. In the ordinary car there is much jerking and the Rolls-Royce car there is no jerking. That will not benefit you. After all it is car. You can use it for going here to there, there to here, that's all. Therefore our Vedic civilization, they are not very much eager to manufacture a motor car, they are satisfied with the bullock cart. Because after all you have to go from this place to that place. And there was no need of big, big roads, three thousand miles long for driving the car. You see. The bullock cart was sufficient, here to there, a few miles. But they were interested to cultivate spiritual knowledge. That is Indian civilization. Vyāsadeva was living in a cottage and just see literature. CāṇakyaPaṇḍitawas prime minister of India and he was living in a cottage, drawing no salary and he has given his politics and moral lesson, so sublime. So here at the present moment, the motor car civilization, he's anxious how to get a Rolls-Royce motor car, that's all. That is his business."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):When you say Swamiji, very humbly I would like to know, that scientific inventions should not be stopped, what should be the actualmodus operandicontinuum on...",Prabhupāda,"Modus...athātobrahmajijñāsā,to enquire of the absolute truth.Jīvasyatattva-jijñāsānārtho yaś cehakarmabhiḥ,karmayou should do but thekāmasyanendriya-prītiḥ,find out this verse. (aside:) You can close this door.Kāmasyanendriya-prītiḥ,our desires should not be engaged for sense gratification. That is going on. All desires, all improvement, all science, they are being... Just like you were speaking about the protein deficiency. That is all concerning the body. Body means senses. There is no higher study."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):That we admit that there's not very high study and it's not something final but I think some...,Prabhupāda,"No, that protein fooding supply... Suppose the birds and bees, they have no research institute. They have sufficient protein supply, this supply and that supply by nature. An elephant has got so big body and so much strength that they have not found it by your scientific research. The nature is supplying.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ[Bg.3.27],it is being done. Why you are wasting time in this way? You study what isprakṛti,and what is behindprakṛti.That is real study. The protein supply is already being done. Just like a cow is eating grass and she's supplying milk, full of protein, so do you think the protein is coming from the grass? Can you eat grass?"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Something must be...,Prabhupāda,"Some... That is something, then there's no perfect knowledge. That is not perfect knowledge. It is... Everyone knows the cow does not take any protein food, it takes on the grass."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Grass is quite rich in protein.,Prabhupāda,"Then you take, why you are searching after protein?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Because we cannot digest the fibre in it.,Prabhupāda,Then? Then it is not suitable for you. Therefore nature's arrangement is that protein can be produced through the body of the cow.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I think Swamiji, nature's arrangement was not made for (indistinct) human beings that we have come.",Prabhupāda,"Nature was defective, you mean to say?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, sir.",Prabhupāda,Then?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):I mean nature's way is designed as a ecological balance of the...,Prabhupāda,"Nature's... If you follow the nature's law, then everything is there. If you deviate (from) the nature's law, then that is defective. (indistinct—some guests reply all together)"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Swamiji, nature's balance has been upset by us, us...",Prabhupāda,That's all right. Therefore I say...
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Otherwise there would not be that many human beings here. It was all the time checked by nature's forces. We have just constrained nature by our efforts.,Prabhupāda,"So that is, that is my point that nature is doing. As soon as you violate nature, then you become defective. That is... Therefore one should live natural life."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Kāmasyanendriya?,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Do you want me to read this,kāmasyanendriya-prītiḥ?",Prabhupāda,"India? No, I'm not speaking of India."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Kāmasyanendriya-prītiḥ.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes,kāma,yes. Read it."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:""Life's desires should never be aimed at gratifying the senses.""",Prabhupāda,Read the verses.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:,Prabhupāda,"Yes. This is the meaning thatkāmasya,we have got some demands of the body. That does not mean it is meant for sense gratification. We require something,āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam,these four things are the demands of the body. We must eat something, we must sleep for some time, we must have sex life also, we must defend. That is all right but not for sense gratification. That a child is required, progeny is required, for that sex life is good, but they are using sex life for pleasure and killing the child. And implicated in sinful activities and therefore suffering. And scientists encouraging them, ""Yes, you can kill child.""Why should you create child and kill him? That nonsense, they cannot understand."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Swami, can I ask you a very silly question which has been asked to us a lot of times and we don't have a satisfactory answer, to whit: why is the cow sacred and not the other animals?",Prabhupāda,Because it gives milk.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But there are a lot... Buffaloes give milk too.,Prabhupāda,Not so much.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):In larger quantities.,Prabhupāda,"But, milk means it is scientifically proven, milk means cow's milk."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):But what about the killing of those cows which are not the milching type, as cows that are being bred here?",Prabhupāda,"First of all, killing is sinful. Christ said, ""Thou shalt not kill."" That is sinful, it doesn't matter whether you kill cow or goat or anything. But from economic point of view, cow is very important because it supplies milk. And milk preparation, we Indians know how many you can get nice milk preparation.Dahi, rābṛi,this, that,Huh? But how nutritious, how palatable. And that is good for human being. First thing is that why you should kill if you have got sufficient food, eh?Patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyam[Bg.9.26].Eh? Vegetables, fruits, then food grains, then sugar, everything is there sufficient. At least we Indian, we know we can prepare hundreds and thousands of preparations, nice palatable, enjoyable. Why should you go to kill the animal?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Well scientists claim that meat ah...,Prabhupāda,"Scientists, first of all we have rejected that."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):...provides excellent quantity of proteins. (laughs),Prabhupāda,"But however protein you may accumulate, can you stop your death?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):No.,Prabhupāda,"Then what is value of protein? If you think that protein will save you from death, then you collect the best protein. But after all, you are going to die. Nature will not allow you to live, even you take much quantity of protein."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):That's correct.,Prabhupāda,"First of all make solution that you will not die. Then try to find out best protein. What is your answer about this birth, death, old age and disease? Can you check it?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, sir.",Prabhupāda,"Then? You take protein, why you are becoming old?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):The researches, though they have been made, they are imperfect again.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):They are imperfect, surely imperfect. ""Maybe,"" ""perhaps."" (laughs) (indistinct) But scientists say thatRomewas not built in a day. (laughter)",Prabhupāda,"Therefore Indian civilization is that you take rice, wheat,ḍāl,vegetable, a little milk, whatever protein and vitamin A,B,C,D can be available, that is sufficient."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Dr. Malhotra has done excellent work on nutrition and he has done two books. In those books he has advocated that milk is not the only best diet. Balanced food, you can have by I meanḍālsand so many other sources.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Milk is not the only one.,Prabhupāda,"In, in, in your Punjab, in United Province..."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Swamiji, my main question is although spiritualism is the Absolute Truth, can we not in some way make spiritualism in such a way, modify it in such a way, as to help the common people?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):The masses.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that we are doing."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):They have been steeped in ignorance for such a long time, it will take a long time to bring them into the fold of spiritualism.",Prabhupāda,"No, it has been made easy by LordCaitanyaMahāprabhu. That you don't commit sinful activities and chantHareKṛṣṇa. ChantHareKṛṣṇaand don't commit sinful life, that's all. And sinful life we have given them, no illicit sex—we don't say, ""no sex""—no illicit sex, no illicit sex, no meat eating. Suppose... They are not now eating meat, are they unhealthy? They are known now as bright-faced. So no illicit sex, no meat eating, no intoxication, and no gambling. This is avoiding sinful life. And chantHareKṛṣṇa. Do you see the result? Do you see the result? Within four, five years how they have advanced. Not that they're Vedantists or they have studied all theVedas, not that. Simple thing. Have you ever come here in the evening when they performārati,kīrtana?Just see how ecstatic it is. Simple thing. Don't commit sinful activities and chantHareKṛṣṇa,bas. You'll become elevated.Jagāi,Mādhāi, they were—in those days, because they were drunkards, women hunters, meat-eaters—they were considered most sinful. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhudelivered them by this process. There were twoJagāiandMādhāiand now hundreds and thousands of Jagāis and Mādhāis are becoming purified.Pāpī-tāpījatachilo,hari-nāme uddhārilo,tārasākṣījagāimādhāi.Everyone wants evidence.Huh?Pāpī-tāpī,all sinful men were delivered simply by chantingHareKṛṣṇa. So you may ask what is the evidence?Tārasākṣījagāimādhāi,the evidence is here,jagāimādhāi. So not thatJagāi,Mādhāifive hundred years ago, now see at the present moment. They did not come to me after studying all theVedas, and Vedantists. They come to me, I ask them that, ""Don't commit these sinful activities and chantHareKṛṣṇa.""That's all. Everyone can do, even the child can do. So you are all educated men, you study this philosophy, try to understand, also join. It is your duty, because you are Indian.CaitanyaMahāprabhuentrusted this mission to the Indians."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):At this time I think India also needs as much spiritual movement as anybody else in the world.,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):At this time I think India itself needs as much as spiritual needs.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):We are as much backwards as anybody else in the world, probably more so.",Prabhupāda,Because we have lost our original culture and we could not take the Western culture. So we are in the wilderness.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Because here the average man takes more interest.,Prabhupāda,Because they are fed up.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Whereas in India the average man doesn't even take interest.,Prabhupāda,"No, he knows, ""What is thisHareKṛṣṇa? We know it, now reject it."""
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):An average Indian, I think he will not be able to tell you how many chapters there are in theGītā.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, they have never been taught. But still they areKṛṣṇaconscious."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"When we hold our meeting in India twenty thousand, thirty thousand people come still, because by nature they are inclined. By artificial means they are being subdued. And in every step I can feel—they are not openly saying—the government is giving me trouble. They don't want this movement may go on nicely in India."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):But rules cannot be...,Prabhupāda,"No, that cannot be suppressed, that cannot be suppressed."
Balavanta:,"Balavanta:This is Dr. Fenton, Prabhupāda, he's a professor of religion at Emory University.",Prabhupāda,Oh! Very good. Hm. (aside) What is the time now?
Devotee:,Devotee:Its twenty of two.,Prabhupāda,Time.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Can we touch your feet, Swamiji?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that's all right."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Can we please?,Prabhupāda,"Come... You can offer your obeisances. Hm, so that is the father's duty to see the child is grown completely spiritual, so that he may not have to come again in the mother's womb.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmeti[Bg.4.9].So..."
Devotees:,Devotees:JayaŚrīla Prabhupāda.,Prabhupāda,"Thank you very much. (Indian guests leave and devotees offer obeisances.) I talk with the professor of religion sometimes, ""What is the meaning of religion?"""
Devotee:,Devotee:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. What is that college you are employed?
Professor Fenton:,Professor Fenton:Emory University. Its about three miles from here.,Prabhupāda,"So, what definition you give to religion?"
Professor Fenton:,"Professor Fenton:It has to do with saving, something that binds societies together, it has to do with the supernatural of (indistinct) God. And hm... Sometimes...",Prabhupāda,That there is relationship with God. Is it not? Religion has got relationship with God.
Professor Fenton:,"Professor Fenton:Yes, but sometimes it's simply something that holds a society together. Both are religion. Sometimes religion is shameful, sometimes its man's highest glory.",Prabhupāda,"Hm... (aside) You come here, I could not follow him."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:He says sometimes religion is shameful.,Prabhupāda,Shame.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Shameful.,Prabhupāda,What is that shameful?
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:There is a false religion and there's... Sometimes religion is the most glorious thing.,Prabhupāda,"Then there is no standard definition of religion. Sometimes this, sometimes that, like that. What is the definition...?"
Professor Fenton:,"Professor Fenton:Oh no, the more I study it, the more it slips through my fingers. I've been teaching for fourteen years and still don't know what I'm teaching.",Prabhupāda,"Just like Christian religion, what it is teaching?"
Professor Fenton:,"Professor Fenton:Christian? It is the humanization of man, to trust in Lord Jesus Christ.",Prabhupāda,Yes. And why trust Lord Jesus Christ?
Professor Fenton:,"Professor Fenton:Because he is the root to reality, the truth.",Prabhupāda,"That means he's son of God, is it not?"
Professor Fenton:,"Professor Fenton:Yes, but I personally am not that orthodox. That is the orthodox teaching.",Prabhupāda,"Hm. Teaching must be orthodox, otherwise what is the value? If the teaching changes, that is not very good."
Professor Fenton:,"Professor Fenton:Well, it may be that it changed in the early history of Christianity through Greek influence on its Jewish background.",Prabhupāda,"It is changing now also, they are so... Change is of the material world, in the spiritual world there is no change, absolute. In the relative world there is change. So our definition of religion is little different from the worldly definition. Our definition... ""Our"" means there should be the real definition: religion means the laws which are given by God."
Professor Fenton:,Professor Fenton:Sanātana-dharma.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes.Sanātana...Yes, religion should besanātana.Sanātanameans there cannot be any change. Just like every living being eats, you cannot change it. You cannot say that this living entity is not eating. Apart from human society, even in animal society, a living being eats. This is his religion. Sleeps, has sex, these are eternal characteristics. Similarly, religion means spiritual characteristics. That spiritual characteristic is also pervertedly reflected in the material world. Just like every one is servant. Anyone, any one of us, we are all servant. You are serving the University. He is serving the..."
Devotee:,"Devotee:He is serving, serving.",Prabhupāda,"He is serving International Society. I am servingKṛṣṇa, or he is servingKṛṣṇa, like that. So everyone is serving, this is religion. To remain a servant. It does not mean that the Hindus are only servant, or Muslims are servant and Christians are not. Everyone is servant. Is it not a fact?"
Professor Fenton:,Professor Fenton:I hope it is.,Prabhupāda,"That servitude or service has to be rendered to God. That is perfection of service. So that is religion. We are serving, I am serving this, you are serving that, you are serving... But when that service is rendered to God,Kṛṣṇa, that is perfect service, perfect, perfection aḥ... satisfaction, that is religion. According to Sanskrit dictionary or what is it called? The dictionary?"
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Sanskrit dictionary.,Prabhupāda,"Religion, inBhagavad-gītāKṛṣṇa, God, is demanding that you surrender. This surrender business is of the servant. Just like I can say to my servant, ""Just hear me what I say, do it."" And he does it. That is servant. A servant cannot dictate, the master can dictate. Servant is to obey the dictation of the master. That is religion. When the servant obeys the dicta... (aside—indistinct) Hm. Take this picture, keep there. This picture, here, here. You come here. Take thisvasedown. Yes. We... God is great. God is great. Do you understand? God is great."
Professor Fenton:,Professor Fenton:Great.,Prabhupāda,And we are subordinate. Is it not our position?
Professor Fenton:,"Professor Fenton:Being servant, yes.",Prabhupāda,"This is our position. God is maintainer and we are maintained. God is predominator and we are predominated. This is our position. We are not equal to God, neither over God. We are always subordinate. And why you are subordinate? Because He maintains us. That is the difference between God and ourselves. He is the supreme being and we are subordinate being. We are maintained by God. That is Vedic instruction.Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānāmekoyobahūnāṁvidadhātikāmān.(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13) This is understanding of God. He isnitya,He's eternal, and we are also eternal because we are samples of God. God is great and perfect and in our this position we are subordinate, and in material condition we are imperfect. So even if we become perfect, still we remain subordinate. Therefore our position is always to abide by the orders of God. This is religion. When we abide by the orders of God, then we are religious. When we do not, then we are demons or Satan. (speaks with arriving guests in Hindi, inviting them to come in and asking whether they have been to the temple inVṛndāvana) Religion means to remain faithful to God and abide by His order. That is religion. (end) You are well now for distributing books?"
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:[break] ...these areprabhusfrom different temples. Some work under the direction of the temple presidents and some work under my direction. And all these devotees distribute at the airports. Mostly big books.,Prabhupāda,And you are all feeling all right? Eh? Is there any difficulty?
Devotees:,Devotees:Increasingly blissful.,Prabhupāda,"That is fine. That is wanted. You are expertmṛdaṅgaplayer? I have seen. He is very, very nice."
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Sometimes when we go to the temples they ask us to give class,saṅkīrtanaclass on book distribution techniques. We tell them that before you can take any techniques, first you must follow the principles and study the books.",Prabhupāda,Yes. That is real technique. Our only technique is to be very devout followers of the rules and regulation.
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Sometimes the devotees, in their preaching, they will defeat someone.",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Sometimes we defeat someone by our preaching, and we show them they should take the book, but still they don't take. But if we call them a fool and point out to them how they are foolish, they become offended. So rather that we just very humbly say...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. Our... We know that he is a fool, but we have to present in a different way. We shall say that ""There is nobody as learned as you are."" In this way just make him puffed up, and then you say humbly, ""My only humble request is that whatever you have learned, please forget. Now you try to understandCaitanyaMahāprabhu. That's all."" This is the different way of calling him, that ""Whatever you have learned, this is all rubbish."" We simply say, ""Kindly forget them. Now you turn your attention toCaitanyaMahāprabhu."" This is the way PrabhodānandaSarasvatītaught us. You flatter him, ""Sir, I have got one request."" Flatter him like anything, falling down on his leg and becoming humble and... ""Sir, I have got one request."" ""What is that?"" ""You are very learned scholar. But kindly forget them, and you try to turn your attention toCaitanyaMahāprabhu."" He will not be angry. Then, if he turns his attention toCaitanyaMahāprabhu, then naturally he will forget all rubbish things."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):We've been trying more and more, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to make our techniques of distribution more honest and straightforward, not to cheat so much as some of these methods in the past.",Prabhupāda,"No, the thing is that Kṛṣṇa's service is so sublime that even if we cheat, you are not culprit. But because we have to deal with the worldly man, we have to go according to their rules and regulation on cheating. Otherwise, a devotee ofKṛṣṇa, he never cheats. He never cheats. Whatever he does... Just like a mother says to his child, ""My dear child, if you take this medicine, I will give you thislugloo."" The child is diseased. He will not be able to digestlugloo,but the mother sometimes cheats him. And when he takes the medicine thelugloois not delivered. Similarly, sometimes we have to say so many things very pleasing to him, but our business is that let him take this medicine. That is tactics. But that is not cheating. If the mother helps the child in drinking medicine and then afterwards she does not supply thelugloo,that is not cheating. Some way or other... That is the instruction ofRūpaGosvāmī,yenatenaprakāreṇamanaḥkṛṣṇeniveṣayet:""Somehow or other, let everyone beKṛṣṇaconscious."" There is no question ofvidhi-niṣedhā.Sarvevidhi-niṣedhāsyur etayorevakiṅkarāḥ.The other rules and regulation will act as servant, but the main business is to bring one toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is the main business. We are not meant for cheating anyone. We have no business. But to lead one toKṛṣṇaconsciousness we may say something sometimes. So that is not cheating."
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we open up these new airports, because the authorities, they are not familiar with us, they become very demoniac towards us. And some of them actually, they're thinking aboutKṛṣṇaall day...",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Just like the Mohammedans were benefited.,Prabhupāda,"They say, ""Here is theKṛṣṇaman."" So he utters the name ofKṛṣṇa. That is good for him."
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):And then after a while, when they become our friends, then they may stop and listen to us.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, because he has chantedKṛṣṇa, ""Here is theKṛṣṇaman. Here is the rascalKṛṣṇaman."" (laughter)"
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:We found one policeman at the Atlanta airport was always harassing the devotees, trying to stop them. And one time I came down the stairs and I saw him in the corner readingĪśopaniṣadand trying to understand. They know that we have some knowledge; they are just envious of our success. They want to find out, ""What is thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness about?"" They don't want to admit that they want to know. Actually everyone wants to know aboutKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, they must."
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:You said that everyone is hankering for these books.,Prabhupāda,So he read thatĪśopaniṣad?
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Yes. He tried to understand.,Prabhupāda,Then?
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Now he does not harass us so much now.,Prabhupāda,"(chuckles) So we have to do like that. Here everyone is demon, everyone. Demon means they are busy for sense gratification. That is demon. And devotee means he has no sense gratification. He is only busy how to satisfyKṛṣṇa. That is the devotee. Anyway, if you serveKṛṣṇasincerely,Kṛṣṇais with you. You will never fall in danger."
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Sometimes the devotees question, ""What is the best book to distribute,Caitanya-caritāmṛtaorBhagavad-gītā?""We're thinking all of them are absolute. It does not matter.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. It is just like sugar doll. Anywhere touch—it is sweet. That's all. When I read books, I open anywhere. Any book I take, and anywhere I open, and I read."
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):Sometimes we feel like... I know myself personally, if I'm distributing, like, Second Volumes ofCaitanya-caritāmṛtasI have this doubt, this feeling that it's sometimes hard for me to understandCaitanya-caritāmṛta,and I feel like thekarmī,he will open the book, and he will look into it, and he will become offended because he won't be able to understand hardly a word of it.",Prabhupāda,"No,Caitanya-caritāmṛtais not meant for ordinary person.Bhagavad-gītā, Īśopaniṣadand other thing..."
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Kṛṣṇabook?,Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇa.They will read as story book. TheKṛṣṇatrilogy is selling very nice?
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Yes.Nectar of Devotionalso.,Prabhupāda,Nectar of Devotionis very nice.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):There's many psychologists at the airport. I would attract them by giving them that particular volume and saying how this deals with the psychology of the conditioned self. And they were attracted in that way.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is very nice,Purañjana. His city, his gates, various manifestation."
Devotee (4):,"Devotee (4):Sometimes we are very encouraged because we find people, they come back to us. They say, ""I have gotten this volume, and I'd like to have the first part"" or ""I'd like to have the Second Canto."" I found that in the army base among the soldiers... I went to distribute at an army base with the soldiers. And one man saw me, and he came up, and he says, ""Can I have the Second Canto? I liked the first one so much."" It's enlivening for us.",Prabhupāda,Sometimes they come and demand.
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:More books, yes.",Prabhupāda,That is good.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Sometimes they want three or four or five at a time. (Prabhupāda chuckles) One boy...CārudeṣṇaPrabhuand I were distributing to him. First he distributed one to him. Then I saw he was coming and I approached him again, the same, five minutes later. I said, ""Didn't you get the story book,Kṛṣṇabook? You got the philosophy book,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Now take the story book,Kṛṣṇa."" And he tookKṛṣṇabook, and thenCārudeṣṇacame up and distributed two more books to him.",Prabhupāda,"So when they takeKṛṣṇatrilogy they take set, three?"
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Usually one, just one.",Prabhupāda,"It is closed, this? Drafty."
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):Sometimes we also, I know myself, ask them... We open the page, the front cover, and show 'em theHareKṛṣṇamantraand say, ""If you simply chant thismantra,you will be able to understand these books in a much higher way."" Actually, it's helped.",Prabhupāda,That is fact. His heart becomes cleansed to take up.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):They even say, ""I've seen him before.""",Prabhupāda,Where they have seen me? Somewhere. (chuckles)
Devotee (7):,"Devotee (7):There was one lady when you were here the last time at the airport, she would ask, when we saw the woman at the airport, practically every day, ""When is that nice gentleman going to come back to Atlanta?"" And she's always thinking about you. [break]",Prabhupāda,...that (sic:) Kenneth Keat? Bring that letter. He wrote to Gurudāsa?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"(sic:) Kenneth Keat was ambassador in India. So Gurudāsa met him. Now he is ambassador in Israel. So he has written that ""You are all doing very nice work."" People appreciate, any intelligent man."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):For one period of two or three days we were going to the airport and simply... This was during the whole controversy about the cheating and the honesty and..., that controversy. So we just went and we just started preaching. And we actually didn't find that much of a diminution in the sales of the literatures. In fact one time a couple of us went out indhotīseven to the airport, without wigs or anything, for a weekend. And we still did nicely. It was a little more difficult. They weren't so... Some of them weren't as warm. But we find that the businessmen, they can be convinced by just preaching.",Prabhupāda,Read it.
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:""Dear Gurudāsa, Thank you for your letter of January 2nd and for your continued prayers for me in my work. As you perhaps do not know, I am now ambassador to Israel. I have been in the United States for a couple of weeks but have not been able to arrange for any free time in which I could meet with you and have not been on the West Coast or at any point except Washington and New York. I hope it may be possible at some future time for us to get together, since, as you know, I have great respect for you and your associates who serve the Lord according to your faith and perform many good deeds in these hectic days. Warm personal regards. Sincerely, Kenneth Keating.""",Prabhupāda,"So any sane man will appreciate our activities. We are doing simply to turn people's attention towards God, that's all. That will make him happy."
Sudāsa,"Sudāsa(?):Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's been several places in the First Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamyou say how we have to get the class of men, how if the leaders take to thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness then...",Prabhupāda,Others will follow.
Devotee:,"Devotee:The mass will follow. Some other times I've heard you say, like the other day, that the masses of people... When BalavantaPrabhuwas running for office you were saying that it'd be very difficult to get our present-day leaders to take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. I'd just like to try to understand further, whether it is the masses or the leaders?",Prabhupāda,"No, we are dealing generally with the masses. But if we can convert one leader, then it is equal to turning many people in the mass. That is the idea. Some way or other, we are doing Kṛṣṇa's service. Either you serve the mass or the leader, it doesn't matter. Your service is recognized."
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Sometimes the devotees question, if they were pure, then they could get everyone to take a big book. It's simply our fault that we're not pure enough that we can't get everyone to take a big book. Or is it just that we can't engage everyone, we can't get everyone to surrender completely?",Prabhupāda,"Well, that is also a devotional attitude. Just likeCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid that ""I do not loveKṛṣṇa. So that's... And if I would have loved, then I would have died without His presence. But I am living now. Therefore I have no love forKṛṣṇa."" This is another thing. One who is too much addicted to the service ofKṛṣṇa, that is very good sign. So your headquarter is now Pittsburg?"
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:No, now Philadelphia.",Prabhupāda,"Philadelphia, oh."
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:It's in Rūpānuga's zone.,Prabhupāda,"In the Philadelphia University, I think, there was one Mr. Norman Brown."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:The Temple University.,Prabhupāda,"Not Temple, Philadelphia."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:The one who took yourNectar of Devotion?,Prabhupāda,"No, that is Temple University. There is another university, I think Pittsburg University."
Devotee (5):,Devotee (5):The University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.,Prabhupāda,"Ah, yes."
Devotee (4):,Devotee (4):They call it Penn.,Prabhupāda,"That university, there is one professor, Norman Brown. I met him. He was a very nice gentleman. He carried my bags to the bus station. He was very kind. His father was a clergyman in India, so he was born in India. So he has got good respect for Indian culture."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Is that when you went to speak in Philadelphia?,Prabhupāda,Um hm.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Then that was when Nikhilānanda was there. Didn't you speak in his class?,Prabhupāda,Nikhilānanda was in New York.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:At that time.,Prabhupāda,He is now dead?
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Yes, I think so.",Prabhupāda,"Nikhilānanda was working with Dr. Bose, Bose's laboratory, and before my joining, it was disclosed that I was also... Dr. Bose had one department. He was in charge."
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Śrīla Prabhupāda, you first began to distributeBack to Godheadmagazine by yourself, right, in India? You would go to the shops?",Prabhupāda,"That was second stage. The first stage I used to publish and distribute asgṛhastha,I did not mind whether one page or not. I was distributing. So spending about four hundred, five hundred rupees, I did not care if one page or not, but I'll distribute. Then, when I retired, left home, I was publishing and distributing myself to get subscription. The subscription was very cheap, two rupees, four annas, I think, for the year. Two copies per month. Just like you publishedThe Harmonist?Like that. Then I publishedBhāgavatam.So I was going to libraries, school, colleges, and everyone was purchasing. MyBhāgavatawas being purchased by your Congress Library. In Delhi they have got office. So there was standing order, eighteen copies of my book as soon as they are published. The head librarian in India, New Delhi, he gave me standing order. Dallas is very cold? No. Like this."
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Dallas is warm.,Prabhupāda,"Warm, oh."
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Probably warmer than here.,Prabhupāda,New York is cold.
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Yes. Now in New York they're distributing 100,000Back to Godheadsevery month, New York temple. And you saw thelugloofrom New York?",Prabhupāda,(chuckles) Yes. Whichlugloo?
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:They are making in New Yorklugloosand packaging them, distributing them on the streets withBack to Godheadmagazine. Many people come back for more. They like the taste.",Prabhupāda,And for eachlugloothere is magazine? No.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Pardon?,Prabhupāda,"If anyone wantslugloo,then he have to take one magazine? No. (laughter) Onelugloopresentation for one magazine."
Devotee (4):,"Devotee (4):We were thinking about how everyone knows aboutKṛṣṇanow. In the United States they didn't know before, but when they see this little picture on the book, they all know, ""That isKṛṣṇa."" We hand them the book, and we say, ""We're passing these out."" They say, ""Oh, that isKṛṣṇa."" So it's so successful that everyone has learned aboutKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, as soon as they see the picture, they understand it isKṛṣṇa."
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:They see the picture ofKṛṣṇaor the name and they think of the devotees chanting.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, by seeing you."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:I once asked a boy in Washington temple how many devotees he thought we had, and he said, ""Oh, I cannot guess."" And I said, ""Make an educated guess."" And he said, ""Well, I've seen you here and I think maybe two million."" (laughter) And I said, ""Three thousand. Now just see the potency ofHareKṛṣṇa. You're thinking we're two million, and we're simply a handful."" He became a little convinced. So our books make us millions. People think we are millions because of the books.",Prabhupāda,"Push on this. Then our movement is successful. All Americans should have at least one set of book. That is not very difficult for them, to purchase one set book. But it will be a good asset for them if they keep and see sometimes. Any line he reads, he will get transcendental knowledge."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):There is one very wealthy man in Atlanta who... We went and did a nice presentation at his home. And then afterwards we distributedprasādamand had a nicebhajana, kīrtanas.Then afterwards he bought the whole set of literatures and gave a hundred dollar donation for all of the literatures, and he has them now.",Prabhupāda,Yes. For an American gentleman one hundred dollars is nothing.
Devotee (5):,"Devotee (5):Just like in theKṛṣṇabook it says anyone who reads this, he will become a devotee.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that's a fact. Anyone who reads that book, he will becomeVaiṣṇava."
Devotee (5):,"Devotee (5):And a year ago in a mall in Pittsburg, because I stay at the Pittsburg temple, I gave a bigKṛṣṇabook to a...",Prabhupāda,George has become?
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Pardon?,Prabhupāda,"George, George Harrison."
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:George Harrison?,Prabhupāda,He has become a devotee ofKṛṣṇa.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):He's living in the temple?,Prabhupāda,"No. He, not temple, but he chants always. He is keeping oneJagannāthawithin the bead. He showed me: that ""I have put..."" He saw me inVṛndāvana."
Devotee (8):,Devotee (8):We use his name quite a bit to distribute books. A lot of people take books because of his name. We often wonder what he was actually doing as far as the movement was concerned.,Prabhupāda,He has got his foreword in theKṛṣṇabook.
Devotee (5):,"Devotee (5):Just likeKṛṣṇasays. What the big men do, the common men follow.",Prabhupāda,"He gave me first money for publishingKṛṣṇabook, $19,000. He is a good boy. He is a good boy, and he has got good regard for me."
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):He just recently went on a concert tour around the country, and he was having the young people chant Kṛṣṇa's names in the concert. And because of the concert tour, many, many, many books were distributed, unlimited.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, his song, ""Kṛṣṇa..."" I have forgotten that. That record?"
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Yes. And he went on a tour of the United States, playing at different cities, concerts, and he would ask people in the audience to chant, ""Kṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇa.""",Prabhupāda,He was asking?
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):And wherever he would go the devotees would be there withprasādaand literatures, distributing profusely. Very successful. Sometimes it seems thatKṛṣṇais arranging these concerts simply so young people can come together so we can be there to reach many, many thousands at one time.",Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇais all-attractive.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:But we have no attraction forKṛṣṇa. You are attracting us toKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"(laughing) ActuallyKṛṣṇais attracting. One, what is called, touchstone, no? Magnetic stone?"
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Yes, magnet.",Prabhupāda,"So background, magnetic stone, one iron, and then another iron, another iron. It is all attracted."
Devotee (5):,Devotee (5):We are becoming happy by distributing your books.,Prabhupāda,Thank you. It is Kṛṣṇa's book. You have got that cake? Give them.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Just by distributing your books we can become self-realized.,Prabhupāda,"You are already self-realized. Otherwise how you can push on the books? You loveKṛṣṇa. Therefore you are taking so much labor for pushing on. And that is self-realization. If anyone tries to establish thatKṛṣṇais the Supreme Lord, that is self-realization."
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Sometimes the devotees ask if they can take birth again distributing books for you.,Prabhupāda,"Very good. That is real devotion. A devotee does not want to go toVaikuṇṭhaor any liberation. They are satisfied with the service. That is pure devotion. And distributing books for the benefit of going toKṛṣṇa, that is selfishness. But ""I want to simply distribute the books without any remuneration, without any my personal..."" that is pure devotee. Just likePrahlādaMahārājasays that ""I do not wish to go toVaikuṇṭhaunless I take all of these rascals with me."" That is pure devotee. Pure devotion does not mean to... He is always under the protection ofKṛṣṇa. What is the use of goingVaikuṇṭhaor...? Wherever he stays, that isVaikuṇṭha. That is pure devotional service.Mamajanmanijanmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktirahaitukī:[Cc.Antya20.29,Śikṣāṣṭaka4]""Life after life I may go on with this business. I don't want anything."" That is pure devotion. (About cake:) So distribute."
Devotee (5):,"Devotee (5):When a new book comes we're very happy. We read it, and then, when we read it, we become enlivened to distribute it. And sometimes we read one like theBhagavad-gītāor one newŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and then we'll concentrate on that book because it has made us so happy.",Prabhupāda,You have readCaitanya-caritāmṛta?
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Yes. We studyŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamin the morning andBhagavad-gītāin the evening. Then in the day we readNectar of Devotion,Caitanya-caritāmṛta,andKṛṣṇabook at night. All the devotees are reading...",Prabhupāda,It never becomes old.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:No.,Prabhupāda,(chuckles) Yes.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:This is this boy's son.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, your son?"
Devotee (10):,"Devotee (10):Yes, Prabhupāda. He's going to go toGurukulathis summer.",Prabhupāda,Very good. How old he is?
Boy:,Boy:Ten.,Prabhupāda,Hm? How many?
Devotee (10):,Devotee (10):Ten years old.,Prabhupāda,Ten years. And how old you are?
Devotee (10):,Devotee (10):Twenty-seven.,Prabhupāda,"(chuckles) Sometimes young father and children, we say jokingly,bap betaduibhāi:""Father and son, two brothers.""Bap betaduibhāi.In India there are many fathers—the father and son age difference, sixteen years, seventeen years. And mother and son, twelve years, thirteen years. There are many mothers. You have got one son?"
Devotee (10):,Devotee (10):I have a daughter also.,Prabhupāda,Oh. Younger than him?
Devotee (10):,Devotee (10):Yes.,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Balavanta:,Balavanta:These are some things that some guests wanted me to give to you. One made a hat for you.,Prabhupāda,What is this? Cap?
Balavanta:,Balavanta:This is a hat that one of the guests made for you. A temple guest. And they painted this picture.,Prabhupāda,Pencil? This is pencil?
Balavanta:,Balavanta:Pencil or watercolor. I think it's watercolors. (pause),Prabhupāda,So you want to take again election? (chuckles) No.
Balavanta:,"Balavanta:Not if you don't want to, Prabhupāda. I was just thinking it was an opportunity to preach if you want it. But if you're not very enthusiastic about it, I don't want to do it.",Prabhupāda,"No, I am enthusiastic provided you don't want money."
Balavanta:,Balavanta:I think we can get our own... I can get the money. It doesn't have to cost very much. The only thing we would need is maybe two men to help. And we can... It won't cost... Only for two or three months out of the year.,Prabhupāda,Then you can do it. It makes you well known in the city. And you get the opportunity of criticizing the demons. (laughter) That is...
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:This boy isBhaktaDoug, and he was a personal secretary of Maharishi for two years.",Prabhupāda,Oh.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:He traveled all over with him. And one day... He was a very good student, and one day Maharishi said, ""If you really want to know the highest truth, it'sKṛṣṇaconsciousness."" And then he left and he came and joined our tem... (laughter)",Prabhupāda,Maharishi said like that?
Devotee (5):,"Devotee (5):Maharishi must have read one of your books, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,He has read my books?
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:They are just imitating theKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:No other group distributes literatures, though.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:No other group, no other societies of philosophy distributes literatures.GuruMaharaj-ji, they published one magazine for some time, and his devotees, they went out and distributed short time. But they had no taste for continuing the distribution. So they have stopped now.",Prabhupāda,Artificial.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Yes.,Prabhupāda,So he is still making propaganda? No.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Sometimes the Christians are distributing papers still at the airports. We invite them to come and takeprasādawith us every day.,Prabhupāda,They come?
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):Every once in awhile someone we meet when we're distributing books comes and joins us forprasādam,one time a businessman and one time a soldier. Various people sometimes join us. We take a 12 o'clock, 12:30 lunch break. Sometimes we'll be joined by one of these people we distribute books to.",Prabhupāda,When you were with Maharishi? Come here.
Doug:,"Doug:I joined the Maharishi in 1969, and at that time I was living in Washington, D.C. And his national director came, gave a lecture, and they said that they needed some help because they didn't have a center there. So I organized the movement out of my parents' house. I had the center, and I established lectures at all the colleges and started the movement there. And later on, they finally sent some full-time teachers, and they established a center there. And then I started to be with Maharishi and his different courses and doing extensive meditations for long periods of time. And then eventually he formed a committee. This was in 1971-72. He started to form a college called M.I.U., Maharishi International University. And he started to invite educators, and he wanted to... And he also had this...",Prabhupāda,"""M.I.U."" means Maharishi...?"
Doug:,"Doug:Maharishi International University. And so he started to formulate a curriculum. He was trying to present Vedic studies in Western terms. And so he formed this council of the executive called his executive council. It was called The 108. It didn't have 108 people, but this was what he called us.",Prabhupāda,One hundred...?
Doug:,"Doug:The 108. He called it The 108, but the official term was the executive council. And that's what I was with...",Prabhupāda,How many students are there?
Doug:,Doug:How many students do his meditation?,Prabhupāda,"No, the university?"
Doug:,"Doug:In the university? I haven't been with them in a year and a half, but they recently bought a college, and they have part of a college inSantaBarbara, the University of California there. So they're pretty well established educationally. But it's losing its potency actually. I think it's actually reached its peak and left, because when I was with Maharishi also I noticed that it seemed that a lot of his potency seemed to diminish, his charisma, over the years. Seemed to me he'd get more and more depressed if people weren't actually reaching the states that he was talking of. It didn't seem like he was satisfied with the advancement people were making. And certainly he wasn't answering the questions, because all that time I was asking him ""What is the highest truth."" And when he talked to God I would say, ""Who is God?"" And we'd ask him, ""Who isKṛṣṇa?"" and ""What about thisKṛṣṇaconscious movement?"" And it was word jugglery. He'd kind of evade our questions and satisfy our elan, but... those questions kept coming up. Somehow he kept us from going into too much detail about it. But eventually... I didn't see him for a few days. This was when I was in the mountains with him, some other people. And we were making up these curriculums for this college program. And he was doing some transcriptions on theBrahma-sūtras,and he came out, and he was in a very solemn mood, and he said... We asked him what he had realized, what truths he had realized from theBrahma-sutras.And he said, ""Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest state of consciousness."" So I left shortly after that. I feel that I could have been chanting all those years, making some progress.",Prabhupāda,What is his age?
Doug:,Doug:What is my age?,Prabhupāda,"No, his age."
Doug:,Doug:His age? He's sixty-eight.,Prabhupāda,Old man.
Doug:,"Doug:Actually, it's interesting about that, because he finished the wholeBhagavad-gītā,and he put out these first six chapters in a really a boggling word, way, the first six chapters. He was writing in a way that people could still enjoy material sense enjoyment and still do his technique of meditation. But I had a chance to hear the rest of theBhagavad-gītāthat he had translated. And we asked him... We heard that he had it. We asked him why he didn't put it out, and he said that the people of the Western world weren't ready to hear what he had to present. But actually what he had to say was... It's very authentic. What I read was very close with what you have to say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, thatKṛṣṇasays surrender all your senses unto Him. And I have hopes that maybe someday... Balavanta suggested the idea that I should write him a letter and ask him to have a meeting with you. And maybe some conciliation could be made, and maybe he could come to his senses or something that he could propagate thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness also, because he has so many followers. And I think that there must be some sincerity in him, else I wouldn't have spent so long with him. He must have some sincerity. And I think that he obviously feels thatKṛṣṇais the Supreme Lord, and I noticed that on hispūjātable he always had a picture ofKṛṣṇaprotecting the cows.",Prabhupāda,"Instead of asking him to preach, you preach. He has already enunciated a type of formula, and it is very difficult for him to change it. He does not say that he isBhagavān?"
Doug:,"Doug:No, he does not say he is God.",Prabhupāda,That is good.
Doug:,"Doug:He always talked in terms of higher states of consciousness, in terms of cosmic consciousness, which I understand to beBrahmanrealization. Then he talked in terms of, after about the sixth state of consciousness was then God consciousness. And thenParamātmā. Then he talked of the highest state of consciousness, and he said it'sBhagavānrealization. But he completely steers away from putting any type of limitation on people's sense control at all, and this is what I have a hard time understanding. Even though the more I was with him he suggested to his close associates to follow the principles ofbrahmacārī,and he made me one of hisbrahmacārīs,and he told us to read the scriptures every day, and we had a lot of association...",Prabhupāda,What is his personal character?
Doug:,Doug:Pardon me?,Prabhupāda,He is observing celibacy or...
Doug:,"Doug:As far as I'm concerned he's been celibate for an awful long time. And he had, his master... He comes from the Śaṅkarācārya tradition. His master was the last Śaṅkarācārya. And supposedly his master is a life-long celibate. So as far as I know, he always practiced that. Some other rumors have come up somewhere. I heard that the rumors originally originated with the Beatles when they were in India, that there was something going on like that. But as far as I know and anybody else who had been involved with him knew that he was very strict about that. And he encouraged the, me to meet...",Prabhupāda,Brahmacārī.
Doug:,Doug:Brahmacārī.,Prabhupāda,Celibacy. Does he observe?
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Physics, a doctorate in physics.",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Doug:,Doug:I don't think it's a Ph.D. I think it's just a masters degree.,Prabhupāda,In physics.
Doug:,Doug:His master told him to finish school before he could join up with him.,Prabhupāda,He talks science about? No.
Doug:,"Doug:He does talk science, yeah. He tries to present Vedic ideas in scientific terms, so that the people of the West will understand. So originally he came out talking about God consciousness and so forth, but eventually he got more and more into this course he calls the science of creative intelligence, SCI, which is what he... (end)",Prabhupāda,"...and standing naked, that those who are fond of nudie-ism, they can get in next life. ""All right, you stand naked for many years."" This is the punishment. Human society, naked, that is their punishment."
Jayatīrtha:,Jayatīrtha:And during the winter they even lose their leaves...,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Jayatīrtha:,"Jayatīrtha:During the winter, when it's coldest, they lose their leaves.",Prabhupāda,"The trees are taken to be the most tolerant.Tṛṇādapisunīcenatarorapisahiṣṇunā.There is an extreme example of tolerance, this tree life."

So the punishment is that ""All right, you become nudie, you remain standing in one place, for five thousand years."" (laughter) That is right. The trees live up till five thousand years. They live."
Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:Prabhupāda? But they argue that if God wanted us to wear clothes He would have made us with clothes. But He made us without clothes, so...",Prabhupāda,"The thing is that here material world means that whatever you want, you have to work for it. That is material world. Things are there, but you have to work for it. In the spiritual world there is no need of working. You get all necessities. That is the difference."
