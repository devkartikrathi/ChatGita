Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Chiku.,Prabhupāda,What is thatchiku?
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:The brown fruit,chiku.",Prabhupāda,"Oh,chiku."
Indian man:,"Indian man:Oh, the big one. Yeah, that is.",Prabhupāda,"It is well known,chiku.In Gujarat there is amplechiku.This stone is artificially brought here, I think."

Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):[break] ...small trees in here or grass, we can walk in there.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, which way?"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):...poison, Prabhupāda. This one is poison. It's called aki (a key?) apple. I think, I don't know, but I'm not sure.",Prabhupāda,"Without tasting, you say poison? First of all taste. (laughter) If you die, then you say it is poison."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):This is a candlenut tree, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They take these nuts and in old Hawaii they string it through a coconut frond, and then they light it, and it used to burn for a few minutes. It's full of oil. Candlenut.",Prabhupāda,What it is written there?
Indian man:,Indian man:That yellow kind ofcampaka?,Prabhupāda,"No, it is notcampaka.It is calledkaiku(?).[break] ...Melbourne?"
Paramahaṁsa,"They have a park, a botanical garden in Melbourne where we went.",Prabhupāda,Very big and very beautiful.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:There there were no fruit trees.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:In Melbourne there were no fruit trees. Here there are many...,Prabhupāda,But here the poison fruit. (laughter)
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:He says poison.,Prabhupāda,It is better not to have fruit tree than to have a poison fruit tree. What is for?
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is a cinnamon tree over here, a cinnamon.",Prabhupāda,"Oh. Cinnamon tree, you can use the leaves for cooking.Teja-patra."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):This is the same?,Prabhupāda,No.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):It says it's from India and Ceylon.,Prabhupāda,Maybe.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):In either direction, you know, they're all different plants. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...say ""This contains this chemical, that chemical, this chemical,"" but he will never think who has put this chemical. That is his dullness. They will analyze and say, ""It contains this chemical, that chemical, that..."" And who has put this chemical? That they cannot say."
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Very large trees.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):This big one?,Prabhupāda,Maybe thousand years old.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):It's from Africa.,Prabhupāda,African trees are like tall like this.
Indian man:,"Indian man:This is that same one. They give red, different flowers.",Prabhupāda,This is also African?
Indian man:,"Indian man:No, they have in India this tree also. That gives red flowers?",Prabhupāda,"And it was in a small seed. Prepare such seed, you chemist. How strong!"
Indian man:,"Indian man:No, here, from that tree.",Prabhupāda,Oh.
Indian man:,Indian man:We have also in India.,Prabhupāda,"We make thread out of it. It is called cotton wool. We can sit down here? [break] ...Zamindar, very rich man, NarottamadāsaṬhākura. [break] ...cars, but where their men?"
Bali,"Bali-mardana:There is a Buddhist temple here, Chinese Buddhist temple, and I think the cars are for that. And some of the keepers. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...be superintend when the garden opens. [break] ... saw the question, but he cannot answer. So he began to write words like this, whole book, and the examiners saw that it has no meaning. But he has coined so many words. They said, ""Very intelligent."" They passed him. (laughter) Now, ""upperfluous."" You don't find all these words in dictionary. ""Upperfluous rain of agua was dogbendikulali gondolized by lacticism of wine."" It appears very gramatically nice composed, but it has no meaning. So he coined such words, a full book. Because he could not answer. So the time was there. He began to coin words. And he was passed, for his intelligence. Similarly, these people are putting words which you cannot understand, and they are getting their salaries, that's all. [break] ...invent something, that they will not die, there will be no disease, there will be no old age. That is something. What is this nonsense, simply speculating? [break] The cloud is standing there. It is not systematic. Then why the gravitation is not working? There are millions and millions tons of water. Why the gravitation is not working? The law of gravitation, why it is not working? Don't work with a rod.(?) What is the answer? They are not systematic changing. Why? Why the gravitation is not working, fall down? They are heavy, very heavy when they, what is called... Agitation. What is called?"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Friction.,Prabhupāda,"Friction, yes. There is so much sound. So why it is not falling down?"
Indian man:,Indian man:The scientist says the pull of gravitation starts only so high.,Prabhupāda,"Why it is not working in all heights? Then what is their theory? If it is working under certain condition, who made this condition? [break] ...the nature, ""Now you get down these islands. Get(?) the water,"" can they do that?"
Bali,"Bali-mardana:No, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"Then how they will come to know? [break] ...Kṛṣṇawants, immediately this land, by earthquake, can go down, immediately, within a second. So in the Vedic literature nature is accepted. But the creation, maintenance, destruction, that is in the hand of God, not nature. [break]"
Bali,"Bali-mardana:...used to say that they can control the weather. They used to make big propaganda, ""We are now going to control.""",Prabhupāda,Another foolish propaganda.
Bali,Bali-mardana:Now they have given up.,Prabhupāda,"You see? They want to draw some salary, big salaries, by bluffing the government and the public. This is their business. They are failing. They have finished their business on this planet; now they are going another planet. These are nonsense. [break] They know that ""We... So as far as possible, we have bluffed. Now our business in this planet is finished. So let us go to another planet."" This is going on."
Paramahaṁsa,"Even if they wanted to stop this space project, they couldn't stop because they've already spent billions of dollars for making equipment and rocket ships and launching pads and rocket bases and so many employees. If they stop, then so much would be wasted, so many people would be unemployed. So they have to continue even if they know that it's a bluff.",Prabhupāda,"That is the way of falsehood. If once you speak something false, then to protect that falsehood you have to take to so many other falsehoods. This is the way of falsehood."
Paramahaṁsa,One lie leads to another.,Prabhupāda,"[break] ...are going to Venus, Americans and Russians combined together?"
Ambarīṣa,This summer.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, in the summer. Venus is very cold? Why they have selected summer season? (laughter) [break] ...could not go to the moon, and Venus is far above moon. How they will go?"
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):Prabhupāda, when they said they went to the moon and they showed films of them landing and walking on the moon, was this all a bluff?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, here they... All laboratory work, that's all."
Devotee (3):,Devotee (3):They all made it up?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bali,"Bali-mardana:Prabhupāda, they are not going to go to Venus. The American and Russian, they are just going to meet outside the earth. They are not going to any planet.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, that is finished."
Ambarīṣa,They're going to meet in space and float around in space.,Prabhupāda,That is birds are doing also. What is the credit?
Paramahaṁsa,"They are thinking that ""What is the use of going to any other planet, because there is no life on the other planets.""",Prabhupāda,Why no life?
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, they have photographs and things.",Prabhupāda,"Photograph, what is this nonsense photograph? How long it can go up?"
Ambarīṣa,"They're taken from hundreds of miles up in space, and then they say there is no life.",Prabhupāda,"What is hundreds of miles? It is, er, forty billion, what is that?"
Paramahaṁsa,Four billion.,Prabhupāda,Four billion. So how they can calculate?
Paramahaṁsa,"If they took a photograph of the earth planet from up in space, they would probably also say there is no life.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):They say because the atmosphere is not like this planet, others cannot live there.",Prabhupāda,"Why not atmosphere? The moon planet, there is a planet. There is space. There is surface. There is dust. So why not atmosphere the same? It is made of the same ingredients, earth, water, fire. Why do you say that is not same atmosphere?"
Devotee (3):,Devotee (3):They are saying that it's too cold or too hot.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. That is here also. There are many cold places. Do they think that in the cold places there is no life? All nonsense. And only nonsense will believe them. I never believed it. Why? Here we see under this sand there is life. The crabs, what is called? They live within, so many hundreds of thousands. We have seen on the sand."
Indian man:,Indian man:And the polar bears for cold season for living in mounds of snows and all.,Prabhupāda,"There are birds, some birds."
Paramahaṁsa,Penguins.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Penguins birds. There is life.
Bali,"Bali-mardana:Seals, whales, polar bears...",Prabhupāda,"There is life everywhere.Bhagavad-gītāsays,sarva-gaḥ.The life is there everywhere. And moon planet, according to our Vedic literature, that is one of the demigods' place. People live theredaivaage, ten thousand years."
Devotee (3):,Devotee (3):They will not believe in the demigods...,Prabhupāda,"So I will not believe them. That's all, finished. (laughter)"
Devotee (3):,Devotee (3):They cannot see them.,Prabhupāda,"What can you see, teeny eyes? What can you see? Can you see what is there on the other side of the sea? Then does it mean there is nothing? Your nonsense seeing. Why you are believing of seeing? Your seeing power is very, very limited. Why do you believe in seeing? That is childish, ""I cannot see."" What you can see? First of all, let us consider this point. You cannot see anything."
Paramahaṁsa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, people will be very surprised to find out that the moon is farther away from us than the sun when they read your..., when they read Fifth Canto.",Prabhupāda,"But at least, they could not go there. Otherwise, why they are giving up this job? They could not go there. That's a fact. Their plan was to... They were selling land even on the moon planet."
Ambarīṣa,Selling land on the moon?,Prabhupāda,Yes. (laughter)
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:They were selling airline tickets also.,Prabhupāda,"Ah, yes. (laughter) Just see, route.PanAmerican, yes. They sold so many tickets. Such fools there are."
Bali,Bali-mardana:In New York sometimes people sell new immigrants the Brooklyn Bridge.,Prabhupāda,And Moscow Sea. They pitched one flag in the moon planet and named Moscow Sea. Yes.
Indian man:,"Indian man:Just like you said that this moon and other planets are also made of these five elements—earth, water, fire, ether—they brought a rock from there. So they are accepting that the moon is made of those elements also. But they are not accepting that life is there.",Prabhupāda,"No, they'll not accept. Therefore... therefore fools. Why? The circumstance is the same. Why there should be no life? That is foolishness. We have got experience. As soon as there is water, there is life. As soon as there is land, there is life. As soon as there is air, there is life. So where is life? No life."
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):They may agree in undeveloped species, but as far as higher forms of life, they will not agree, such as humans or demigods.",Prabhupāda,"No, that also we cannot agree. If there are lower species, there must be higher species. As we see here is dog also, man also, higher species, lower species, why not there? They can talk all nonsense, but a nonsense will believe. No sane man will believe. [break] ...going to meet in the space?"
Ambarīṣa,Yes.,Prabhupāda,What is the idea?
Indian man:,Indian man:They cannot meet on the earth and they are going to meet on the... (laughter) [break],Prabhupāda,"So I am the only man in the world challenging that ""You have not gone to the moon planet."" Eh?"
Harikeśa,Is it possible there's some difference as to the definition of what the moon planet is? They will say that the moon planet is that planet out there. Do we agree? At night?,Prabhupāda,What is your definition? First of all let me hear.
Harikeśa,I'm still wondering myself.,Prabhupāda,We have got our definition.
Harikeśa,What do we call those planets that rotate around Jupiter and Saturn and... They will say those are also moons.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Different planets, different position. Just like this sun planet is fiery. There is fire. Similarly, in moon planet there is fire, but it is surrounded by cold atmosphere. Therefore it is cooling."
Harikeśa,So that's the specific characteristic of this moon?,Prabhupāda,"Which moon? Yes, this is..."
Harikeśa,Our moon.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Harikeśa,So the other moons that rotate around Saturn and Jupiter...,Prabhupāda,Other moon? There is no other moon.
Harikeśa,So they're just planets?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Harikeśa,The moon is further away than the sun. Wow! (laughs),Prabhupāda,Yes.
Harikeśa,Why does it seem like the moon is...,Prabhupāda,"Seen? Who has seen it? First of all let me..., who has seen it? (Devotees are laughing)"
Ambarīṣa,"Prabhupāda, you said the other day that pretty soon all these lies will be exposed.",Prabhupāda,"They are already exposed because they have left that expedition. That means they are hopeless. That is exposed. But foolish people will not ask them that ""Why you have stopped this expedition?"" They will again go on bluffing, and they will accept. That is the position. Now people should ask them, ""Why you have stopped moon expedition and Venus expedition? You proposed you were going there, making arrangement. Why you have stopped?"" It is failure."
Harikeśa,They might argue...,Prabhupāda,"What is the argument? You have stopped. That is your failure, that's all. You can argue to the laymen, foolish men, but we will say you have stopped; therefore it is failure. All bogus propaganda is now stopped."
Devotee (3):,Devotee (3):They are saying the moon isn't worth develop...,Prabhupāda,"Now they cannot say anything because they are failure. Anything they say, that is all foolishness. They cannot say anything. Once you are failure, you have no value, anything you say."
Harikeśa,"I've heard the argument that when they are going to the moon, they are always in contact, bouncing off these sonar waves and radar waves off the moon's surface, and when they are coming near, they can even see from their little portholes the moon's surface, the same moon that they see on the earth.",Prabhupāda,They say all nonsense. That's all. (chuckles) Why the earth is not brilliant at night like the moon?
Bali,Bali-mardana:It depends on where you are. It depends on where you are looking from.,Prabhupāda,"""Where you are"" means?"
Harikeśa,They have pictures from the moon taken of the earth.,Prabhupāda,Pictures? First of all you see. Then take picture. You cannot see.
Harikeśa,They use all these things to argue that they actually did go to the moon.,Prabhupāda,What is the meaning of argument if they have stopped? That is failure. Don't talk nonsense anymore.Phalenaparicīyate.By the result we have to understand. Your result is you are failure. Then what is the use of talking nonsense? Stop this nonsense.
Ambarīṣa,"It's like five years ago they declared a war on cancer, and they spent billions and billions of dollars on it, and just the other day they now said that it was a complete failure, that the disease has just kept on growing and growing.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. You cannot stop even cancer disease and you are controlling nature. Just see their (?) false, puffed up. They cannot control one disease, and they are going to control nature. We have to believe that."
Harikeśa,"He just told me I was spaced out because I wasn't punching this in, but I'm still astounded by the fact that the moon is further away than the sun. When the devotees hear this tape, they're not going to believe it.",Prabhupāda,Therefore they could not go. I... First of all I said that they might have gone to theRahuplanet.
Harikeśa,"Yes, the Fourth Canto.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. First of all my conviction: they have gone nowhere. They have simply stayed in their laboratory, that's all."
Paramahaṁsa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think somebody might have told you before, but there was a big scandal right after the moon shot when they said they went to the moon and..., that it was all staged in the desert of Arizona, that they...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is the fact."
Bali,"Bali-mardana:WhenPuruṣottamaheard that, he blooped. (Devotees continue laughing.)",Prabhupāda,"Yes. In 1968 I was questioned by the reporters, ""What is your opinion about this moon?"" ""It is simply a waste of time and energy, that's all. It is all false propaganda."" I told to the reporter."
Devotee (3):,Devotee (3):[break] ...real information about the moon from theBhāgavatam?,Prabhupāda,Veda.Vedameans knowledge. What is this? Some animal?
Harikeśa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, do we say that they've gone toRahusimply to placate them?",Prabhupāda,"No, accidentally they went toRahu. Maybe. That is also not..."
Indian man:,Indian man:[break]...gone at all outside this atmosphere of earth.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. [break] ...haven't gone to moon planet, that is my... [break] ...why they will give it up? That is the proof. America was found by Columbus. So many people came from Europe and utilized it. So if they would have gone to moon planet, they would have utilized it. But they have not gone. That is the fact."
Paramahaṁsa,"That was their original proposal, that they can utilize it, make colonies there.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. Yes."
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):The moon exploration, because they thought that we cannot use the moon like Columbus, they used America.",Prabhupāda,That is your excuse.
Harikeśa,That's cause they were in the desert. (laughs),Prabhupāda,"[break] ...grow so many nice dates, you know that? You cannot say in the desert there is no..."
Paramahaṁsa,"Oh, yes. Arabia they grow.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. [break] ...desert nice watermelon will grow. Yes. Nice dates. So people go there, take the dates and take the watermelon.Kṛṣṇahas provided food even there. [break]"
Harikeśa,Would one see gross form on a subtle planet?,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Harikeśa,Like the moon planet is heavenly planet. They're supposed to have subtle bodies there. So would there be any gross forms?,Prabhupāda,Why subtle body? That is material body.
Harikeśa,So we would not be able to see any traces of a civilization?,Prabhupāda,"There is civilization. You have not gone there, rascal. You are simply imagining. (Devotees laugh) There is civilization. First thing is, you rascal, you did not go. You are talking only nonsense. That's it."
Paramahaṁsa,"[break] ...Rahuplanet, that's a hellish planet?",Prabhupāda,Yes. They might have gone to that hellish planet. That's all.
Paramahaṁsa,That seems more befitting them.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes!
Bali,"Bali-mardana:They were not qualified to go to the moon, soKṛṣṇasent them there.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, they are not qualified. Even in this planet, unless one is bona fide, he is not allowed to enter America. How you can go to the moon planet? That is demigods' planet."
Harikeśa,Some of the astronauts became very religious after they supposedly went.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, they are intelligent, that ""This is all nonsense. Real thing is God."" That is... They come to their senses. They are intelligent. [break] (In car:) ...real business is to enhance yourKṛṣṇaconsciousness. These people, they are wasting time simply to know something else. There is no limit.Kliśyantiyekevala-bodha-labdhaye.What is moon planet? What business you have got to know the...? Whatever is stated in theśāstra,accept it, that's all. What is the use of experiment and going there and then again say, ""Oh, it is all failure."" Simply waste of time. The arrangement is there by God. That's all. Spending so much money, hard-earned money, unnecessarily and then say, ""Oh, it is failure."""
Paramahaṁsa,"If they were a little bit intelligent and had some knowledge of theVedas,they would learn that they could go there...",Prabhupāda,"The knowledge is already there. Just like I am speaking. I am not a scientist. On the knowledge ofVedas,that's all."
Paramahaṁsa,"Yes. Just like you have said in theEasy Journey to Other Planets,you can go there by the mysticyogaprocess. You don't have to make some space machine.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Ambarīṣa,The scientists want to go there without performing any kind of austerities.,Prabhupāda,But there is austerities.
Paramahaṁsa,"Yeah, actually they end up performing greater austerity.",Prabhupāda,You have to earn money with so much labor and spend it for nothing.
Paramahaṁsa,Billions of dollars. Some of them are working like madmen.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,They work all day and most of the night. [break],Prabhupāda,"...expedition is exposition of the scientists: useless. But these materialistic persons will be cheated again and again.Punaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30].The scientists will propose something else and they will accept. They will never say that ""You are failure in your moon expedition. Why you are proposing again something nonsense?"" They will never ask. They will pay me, ""Yes."""
Ambarīṣa,The government doesn't want the people in general to know that the scientists are failures because they feel that the people will be put into a lot of anxiety because of this. So they...,Prabhupāda,"No, they are already in anxiety. This material world means anxiety. So many problems there are.Sadāsamudvigna-dhiyāṁasad-grahāt[SB7.5.5].Because they accepted this material world as all in all,samudvigna,they are full of anxiety. Just like if you are on a boat and if you know that after some hours the boat will be drowned, then can you remain without anxiety?"
Paramahaṁsa,"They have some relief, though, because they think that the scientists will be able to protect them.",Prabhupāda,"This is their position. This is their position. Just like we are in this car, but we know it, that any moment there can be accident. So how we can be without anxiety? In the material world, on account of this material condition, we are not going to stay here. There must be anxiety. But if we close our eyes, that is different thing. Otherwise it is full of anxiety. [break] ""... be free from anxiety, then surrender to Me. What I say, do it."" That he will not do. They will manufacture their own way of life. They must be in anxiety. They will never hear whatKṛṣṇasays. And our propaganda is that ""Just you becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, and you will be happy."" This is our... That they will not do."
Ambarīṣa,"...'60, 1960. When did they start to go to the moon?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Ambarīṣa,I think President Kennedy started the program in 1960.,Prabhupāda,Sending dog first of all?
Ambarīṣa,"Yeah, mice and then monkeys and...",Prabhupāda,"[break] ...desert. But here we find, within the desert, petrol. Why not get petrol there and solve your power problem. Can I not raise this question?"
Ambarīṣa,How would they get it back from the moon?,Prabhupāda,There will be petrol. You take it.
Ambarīṣa,How would they get it back here?,Prabhupāda,"As they are coming. They are going and coming. So let them go, and if the surface is desert, then find out oil within."
Indian man:,Indian man:They can make up tanks.,Prabhupāda,"No, you can make devices, fill it up, and throw it. (laughter) [break] ...mad, you should give themmadsuggestion. (laughter) (end) ...how they are beautiful."
Devotee:,Devotee:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Hawaii birds? No. [break]...all these birds?
Devotee:,Devotee:No.,Prabhupāda,I think it is Bulbuli.(?)
Paramahaṁsa,They have those in India?,Prabhupāda,"Not this red, but bluish color."
Paramahaṁsa,Oh.,Prabhupāda,"But of the same kind, having bunch of hair. [break] ...three hundred varieties of birds. How many one has seen? One million.Pakṣiṇamdāsa-lakṣakam.Dāsa-lakṣakammeans one million. [break] ...varieties of life, so many varieties of planets, sky, the sea, ocean, the mountains, the rivers, and they want to compete with God. Just see their foolishness. (laughs) Controlling nature, is there... Eh?Bali-mardana? Scientists they want to control nature."
Bali,"Bali-mardana:Yes, they try to make it rain or stop the rain. They try different experiments.",Prabhupāda,Why not death? Stop death.
Bali,"Bali-mardana:Yes, they are trying that also. They are not succeeding.",Prabhupāda,"That is the misfortune. [break]...they are going to the sky for meeting, the Russian scientists and American scientists? [break]"
Bali,"Bali-mardana:On big island, the island that you visited where the farm is...",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bali,"Bali-mardana:On the island with the farm, the people are, now they are afraid that there will be a volcanic eruption and the whole island will be finished.",Prabhupāda,There is such sign?
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:Siddha-svarūpahad said every twelve years it erupts, and I think it's been ten years since the last one or something. So it's expected that in two years...",Prabhupāda,The last time it devastated? No.
Paramahaṁsa,Partial devastation.,Prabhupāda,"No, when volcano is in smoke, that is dangerous. That is dangerous. [break]"
Devotee:,"Devotee:Shall we sell our land, then?",Prabhupāda,"What will come? Trust no future, that's all. We must be always ready for destruction. Material world is like that.Nityaanityatam.CanakyaPaṇḍitahas says,tyajadurjana-saṁsargam:""Avoid bad men's company.""Bhajasādhu-samāgamam:""Always try to associate with learned, what is,ādhu,with devotees. Avoid this worldly men's association and try to associate with devotees.""Tyajadurjana-saṁsargambhajasādhu-samāgamam,and thensmaranityamanityatam.""And always think that everything here in this material world is for few days."" That's all.Tyajadurjana-saṁsargambhajasādhu-samāgamam. [break] Anityatam.[break] ...be the motto of life. [break] ...associate with the materialistic person, try to associate with devotee, and always think that this world is for few days. That's all."
Ambarīṣa,This world is what?,Prabhupāda,"For few days.Nityamanityatam.[break] ...other.Kurupuṇyamaho-ratram:""And act piously, day and night."" This should be the motto."
Bali,Bali-mardana:That is nice prescription. [break],Prabhupāda,"...yamaho-ratram.[break] Civilization is just the opposite. Always act sinfully, notkurupunyamaho-ratram.Twenty-four hours act sinfully."
Harikeśa,It seems that practically every single person in society today is going to have to go to one of those hells.,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Harikeśa,Every single person in society today is going to have to go to one of those hells.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bali,Bali-mardana:...reads about the different hells he'll become scared. [break],Prabhupāda,"...animals. The animals... You keep the animals here, and take one of them, slaughter—they will think, ""I am safe."" This is animal. All of them will think, ""Oh, I am safe. He is being taken. That's all."" This is their dull brain, the modern animals. [break]...dvī-pada-paśuḥ.These two-legged animals, they will think like that."
Paramahaṁsa,"They say that if you have a herd of sheep and one, the first part of the herd falls off of a cliff, then all the rest of them will simply walk off the cliff.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is calledveriyadāsan.In Hindi,veriyadāsan."
Paramahaṁsa,What is that called?,Prabhupāda,Veriyadāsan.
Paramahaṁsa,What does that mean?,Prabhupāda,"No,verimeans lamb or sheep. Their walk... If you can push one of them in the slaughterhouse, all of them enter. This is calledveriyadāsan.You haven't got to endeavor to push others. You just push one only. ""Fut, fut, fut, fut, fut, fut, fut,"" they all enter. (Laughter) In Hindi it is calledveriyadāsan.Just cheat oneveri,and all others will be followers. [break] Long ago, when we were boys, we saw one comic cinema. That old cinema player was... His name was Max Linder. Max Linder. So this Max Linder was going to a ball dance, and he was waiting in the park, and the ball dance coat, you know? It has got a tail. So he was sitting in a bench, and some naughty boys came and they nailed the tailing part. So when he got up it became torn, like... So his, this hip was visible. So when was dancing in the ball others were seeing his, ""What is this?"" (laughter) So he went to the mirror, he saw, ""Oh?"" So he began to dance and show everyone like this. So others said, ""What is this?"" ""This is the latest fashion. This is the latest fashion in ball dancing."" ""Oh?"" Then all cut their tail coat. You see? ""The latest fashion."""
Devotee:,Devotee:That's how they got the cut now. There's a cut in the coat in the back.,Prabhupāda,"This is theveriyadāsan.[break] ...taken the story from the Aesop's, no,Hitopadeśa.

Paramahaṁsa,"This is a spot that has a very large crab population. Many crabs are living here, big ones.",Prabhupāda,They catch.
Paramahaṁsa,Yes.,Prabhupāda,They say it is very good eatables.
Paramahaṁsa,"Yes, (Laughing) they say like that.",Prabhupāda,And crabs?
Paramahaṁsa,Clams.,Prabhupāda,Oh no? What is called?
Paramahaṁsa,Crabs and clams and lobsters...,Prabhupāda,Yes. Lobster is very popular.
Paramahaṁsa,"Oh, yes, that is a big delicacy. One lobster, if you buy it in the restaurant, they sell it for at least five dollars.",Prabhupāda,Ācchā?
Paramahaṁsa,"Usually closer to ten dollars, for one lobster. Very costly. [break]",Prabhupāda,...import lobster from India. I have seen it. Lobster from Cochin.
Bali,Bali-mardana:South India.,Prabhupāda,"Ah, South India. Lobster and this, what is called? Labhanga...? Cloves. And these cashew. Cashew is produced in India. [break] ...big, big European companies for doing this business in Cochin."
Bali,Bali-mardana:They were set up by the British?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, and Greeks. [break] Americans don't care for this business. They want machine."
Bali,"Bali-mardana:They do not care for the clam business. [break] Europeans consider Americans a little bit barbarian, a little bit uncivilized.",Prabhupāda,Why?
Bali,"Bali-mardana:Because they say that they do not have very much manners, etiquette.",Prabhupāda,"They say boys, they are boys."
Ambarīṣa,Unsophisticated.,Prabhupāda,"Ah, yes. They are in the make-up, not yet fully civilized. [break]"
Devotee:,Devotee:I was thinking if you would like to stay here forRatha-yatrawe can make it bigRatha-yatrahere.,Prabhupāda,Ratha-yatra?
Devotee:,"Devotee:Yes. [break] ...different places, you like to stay here in this nice place, you can translate. Everyone wants you to stay here. I heard one of your letters quoted in Śrī Govinda's letter that you likeRatha-yatravery much. So I think you would like to go somewhere. So if we can have it here, you can attend here.",Prabhupāda,What he is doing?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Cleaning his fishing net. [break],Prabhupāda,...ratha?
Devotee:,"Devotee:We can build it. We have few carpenters here, four or five carpenters. We can build it. [break]",Prabhupāda,"If you can build it, do it.

Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:That is that steel boat we were looking at to get.,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:The white boat there...,Prabhupāda,White boat?
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:Yes, the large white boat just there, that is the one we were after. That is the steet boat.",Prabhupāda,Oh. This one?
Harikeśa,It's not so big. [break],Prabhupāda,...can avoid.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:How are you?,Prabhupāda,Not very well.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:You have carried a big load. What is... Will you be in a position to come to the conference?,Prabhupāda,I don't think so. Which conference?
Yogi,YogiBhajan:This Unity of Man Conference.,Prabhupāda,Where it is?
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:New Mexico. There are about, we have confirmed sixteen teachers coming from, various people from India. We have confirmation of people coming all around the world.",Prabhupāda,"So they have not invited me, I don't think."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:The invitation must have gone.,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Yogi,YogiBhajan:We invited everybody.,Prabhupāda,"Ah, but I have not received an invitation."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Oh, it may be on the way.",Prabhupāda,Mexico City?
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Yeah.SantaFe. We have decided that this is the time for everybody to get together and get their scene together and merge together.,Prabhupāda,"They will never. (laughs) You may call all conferences, hundreds and thousands, but they will never, because there is no common platform. Godless."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:That is what we are trying to provide.,Prabhupāda,"But you are trying, that's nice, but it will be never successful. You can write it down."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, perhaps it is very simple. Somebody has to break the ice.",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Somebody has to break the ice. Somebody, it doesn't matter who. Somebody has to go out and say, ""You are welcome. Come in."" And it has shown response. Even the prime minister has agreed to it. First she was not agreeing. And she is coming in Mexico.",Prabhupāda,IndiraGandhi?
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Um hm. She will be there on the 17th and 18th. So we are carrying that spirit.,Prabhupāda,"The thing is everyone is trying to be united. That United Nation is for the last twenty years. They started in 1947, United Nations? Eh?"
Paramahaṁsa,"Yeah, '47.",Prabhupāda,And it is seventy...
Paramahaṁsa,Almost thirty years.,Prabhupāda,"Thirty years. What they have done? All the best men of the whole world, they are there, but no united, simply disunited. Common platform, they are not agreeable. They do not accept God."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Um hm.,Prabhupāda,"That is the difficulty, no central point. You have got your own philosophy. I have got my own philosophy. He has got his own philosophy. Now, how we will agree?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, I may not agree with your philosophy, and you may not agree with my philosophy, but one thing we both have agreed that you are you, and I am I, and both can have respect and love for each other. And there has to be a place where everybody should be given that opportunity.",Prabhupāda,"That is going on. When I meet you I say, ""Yes sir."" You say, ""Yes sir."" That is all right. That is social etiquette. But real unity is on the platform of spirit soul.Paṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18].Paṇḍita,he issama-darśina.Sopaṇḍitāḥmeans"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, that's agreed. But...",Prabhupāda,"So that requires education.Brahma-bhūtaḥprasannātmānaśocatinakā...samaḥsarveṣubhūteṣu[Bg.18.54].When one isBrahmanrealized, then he can see equally. But that requires education, how to becomebrahma-bhūtaḥ.But everyone isśarīra-bhūtaḥ.Everyone is thinking, ""I am this body."" So how it can be possible? So we may attempt, but it is not possible."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:There are a lot of misunderstanding and misconceptions given against each other.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. Misconception... Just like you have got a body; I have got a body. If I say, ""No, I don't like you ""... If I say, ""I don't like you""... Naturally, when we see superficially, then this tendency will go on. When you see inside, introspectively, then there will be equality. That requires education. So..."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:All right, come and educate.",Prabhupāda,"(Chuckling) But that education is there, the beginning, in theBhagavad-gītā."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, you are shy.",Prabhupāda,"Bhagavad-gītāand the education is there, that, immediatelyKṛṣṇasays,dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā,tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Asmindehe,there is the soul. This is the beginning of education. But there are many learned scholars; they do not believe in the soul. That is the difficulty. They do not believe. A big, big professor.... I have been in Moscow. Professor Kotovsky, he said, ""No, there is no soul. After this finishing of the body, everything is finished."""
Yogi,YogiBhajan:But they don't have experience.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore... So if you assemble some not experienced men, then how there will be unity?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, granted. What we are trying to do is we are giving out a call to all learned, the unlearned... But basic fact is: there is a desire somewhere in the ether that everybody wants to feel each other. And they have not done anything good by negating each other or talking negatively. They have not gained anything. They have realized it now. Otherwise...",Prabhupāda,"Now, what will be the basic principle of unity? That is the point."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:The point of basic unity is respect for each other.,Prabhupāda,"But that is going on. Suppose you have come here. I welcome you. If I go to your place, you welcome me. That respect is going on."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, that's right. That is between two individuals.",Prabhupāda,"Similarly, whenever we come in a big assembly, we respect each one, gentlemen. There is no harm."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, no, but people do not understand why we are like this, why they wear like this. They don't get a chance to explain. At Interreligious Council, I am a member. They never knew. They think we are the most weird people from the Mars perhaps. They don't understand a bit. And now our legal services are helping them, and all sorts of things have happened, and they are trying to understand. And when the last president left the office, he said, in his words of departure, he said, ""I am only limited by the Christ. I never understood anything else. But I do feel from that limit that God is unlimited and it is in everybody."" Asking a fanatic Christian to make that statement to the general assembly, it took us about two years.",Prabhupāda,Hm. You find so many fanatics. How you will unite them?
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Gradually, one by one, one by one, they will understand. Love is the winning point. That's why they don't understand. When they find love from you, they will find love from me, they will love from people, they will love from everybody else. You know, you can take a mango stick and beat somebody, but you can take mango off it and eat. Effort has to be made somehow. And now...",Prabhupāda,"Effort is being made, but the platform, the world where you are staying, that effort is very difficult to fulfill."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:That is agreed. That's typical, difficulty is agreed. I go to India; I find the difficulty. I am here; I find the difficulty. But there are genuine people in the spiritual work...",Prabhupāda,"But one thing is, just like you said some Christian priests?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"That ""I realize that one, God is one."" So if God is one and every one of us after God, then why there is disagreement?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, those... Everybody has limited egos, so we understand that.",Prabhupāda,"No, we should... The conference should be made that if there is God and God is one, then who is that God? What is His characteristic? That should be discussed."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, that's what I say. But what we are trying to do is spend all, what we have righteously earned, provide that platform, and invite somebody. My personal feeling is even if somebody comes and tell us there that we are the worst being on the world, but by coming and opening himself up, herself, he at least acknowledges that there is a mutual existence. At this time I have walked away to every corner, here and there, everywhere. Some people are not aware totally. I was asked one day a question, ""Why theseHareKṛṣṇapeople dance in the streets?""",Prabhupāda,Ecstasy.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:I said, ""Why not?"" I asked the question. I said, ""Why not? What is wrong with them? What do you feel?"" ""But that's not in America. You know, we don't go and dance everywhere."" I said, ""You go in ballroom dances and you dance all the time. You drink and you dance, and you do what you want to do. And they just, in their own life, feel that they enjoy dancing right for God and the world. You dance for your own social contact. They dance for their own divine contact. What is wrong with them? Their leader, their prophet, their spiritual guide danced to God, and they dance to God. Why you think, why you go to the church?"" ""We go to pray."" I said, ""That's their prayer. Why don't you understand the prayer aspect of it? Why you want to understand how they dress, how they like, how they dislike each other?"" And the second question somebody asked me, ""But do you think somebody has the right to convert our children?"" I said, ""But do you think somebody hasnotthe right...""",Prabhupāda,I never asked them to be converted.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, I understand that. My situation is sometimes people ask you a question about me. They think I am another religion, they can ask question of me.",Prabhupāda,...Dr. Judah has written. Where is that book? That Dr. Judah's book?
Ambarīṣa,"We took it to court, and I think (indistinct name)) has it.",Prabhupāda,"One professor, Dr., what is his name?"
Paramahaṁsa,Stillson.,Prabhupāda,"Stillson Judah, he has... Many others also written books about us, but his book is very scholarly. He has written the same thing that... What is that dedication?"
Ambarīṣa,"""So they will understand.""",Prabhupāda,"Ah, ""the parents who will understand them."" My students, mostly they are young, mostly within thirty, some of them little above thirty. So some of their parents they come and congratulate me, ""Swamiji, it is our great fortune that you have come to our country."" That I receive many. But there are other many parents, they are not happy."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:We are starting a parent organization for our kids. We invite the mothers, parents, ask them to stay, and send them back. Idea is basic, and the fundamental idea is: what you are doing is God's will, these people who are following you is God's will, and those who will receive it as God's will... But it is not that everybody sees that God will.",Prabhupāda,"No. God's will is open.Kṛṣṇasays,man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65].God says that ""You always think of Me. You just become My devotee, worship Me, and offer your respect to Me."" This is God's will. ""And if you do this, then you are coming back to Me."" It is clearly said. God's will is declared. There is no secret.Man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad...Find out this ninth verse, er, Ninth Chapter. Yes. Read it."
Bali,Bali-mardana:Sanskrit?,Prabhupāda,That's all. This is God's will. It is not secret. It is open. But the thing is that everyone has got his different God.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, question is very fundamental. Everybody has his own God, so let everybody bring one's own God in understanding. It's not... God is...",Prabhupāda,"God... you have got own God. God says, ""Always think of Me."""
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Um hm. That's true.,Prabhupāda,"So that's all right. The followers may think of Him.Man-manā.""You become My devotee, become My devotee and worship Me and offer respect to Me,"" that's all. So we are teaching our student, ""Here is God,Kṛṣṇa. You chantHareKṛṣṇa, always think of Him. You just offer your respect and worship Him. In this way become His devotee."" We do not... Spiritually, thing is (?) (indistinct) That's all right. And they are doing that and they are getting the result. We do not say that ""Sit down, press your nose, and meditate and this, that,"" or, no. Simple thing. There is God, we have got our temple... (Aside:) Don't make now this sort of thing.... Simple thing. We have got our temple. We say that ""ChantHareKṛṣṇa. Here is God. And think of Him."" As soon as you chant ""HareKṛṣṇa,HareKṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇa..."" Everyone has got the beads. That means you are thinking ofKṛṣṇa,man-manā.And then we are offering respect, go to the temple and offer our obeisance, very simple thing. So we acceptKṛṣṇaas the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So if you don't accept, then you must have your own God. Do that. But the followers of Vedic principle, they will acceptKṛṣṇathe Supreme Lord.Kṛṣṇastubhagavānsvayam[SB1.3.28].I think somebody was telling me thatGuruNanak also acceptedKṛṣṇaas the supreme father. Is it a fact? I do not know."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, we have inSiriGuruGranthalot of things about LordRāma, about LordKṛṣṇa, about...",Prabhupāda,"Now, what isKṛṣṇa? HowKṛṣṇais accepted? Is He accepted as the Supreme Lord?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Kṛṣṇais accepted as incarnation of God.,Prabhupāda,"Well, incarnation of God and God, there is no difference."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:That's it. Also there is a fundamental message in that, that as God created everyone, God created all of us, and in SikhdharmaGod, whatever we want to call it, ultimate reality, beyondsunya-samadha,the truth, and LordKṛṣṇain His incarnation taught, LordRāmataught. And what our problem at this time at the humanity is: the humanity is divided in many forms. And it is the inner hatred which people want to expel (spell?) out.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore I say that every, at least, religious sect... I don't say others, nonreligious or agnostic. There are Christian, Mohammedan,Hindu, Sikhs, or any religious system, they have accepted that there is God, Supreme Truth."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, there is one fundamental thing which this movement may not know. InDasanGrantha,GuruGovind Singh wrote downKṛṣṇaavatāra.",Prabhupāda,Avatāra...
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Kṛṣṇaavatārais in his own poetry. It is about LordKṛṣṇa. If somebody of these people who know Sanskrit and who knowguru-mukhican translate that part...,Prabhupāda,"No, translate or not translate, we have already acceptKṛṣṇaGod. So ifGuruNanak has described Him as God, that's all right. Then ifKṛṣṇais God, accepted byGuruNanak, andKṛṣṇais God, accepted by us, why not put this God, one God?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Yeah. One God is all right. That everybody will agree. But everybody...,Prabhupāda,"That one God,Kṛṣṇasays, ""I am the same, I am the one God, that Supreme Lord.""Mattaḥparataraṁnānyat.Where is...? Find out this verse.Mattaḥparataraṁnānyat kincidastidhanañjaya[Bg.7.7]."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Chapter Seven, text seven. You'd like it read?",Prabhupāda,"And so all theācāryasof India, includingGuruNanak, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya,ViṣṇuSvāmī, Śaṅkarācārya,GuruNanak, they have accepted GodKṛṣṇa. So why not present this God all over the world?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, but question is very simple. Present it among the other Gods. Time has come of a mutual presentation.",Prabhupāda,"No, mutual presentation, simply talking will not do. Suppose we are presenting from India. If we acceptKṛṣṇa... We have accepted, as you say. As so far otherācāryas,namely, Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, theViṣṇuSvāmī, and then, Nimbārka, LordCaitanya, andGuruNanak-practically the whole India, they have acceptedKṛṣṇathe Supreme Lord."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Um hm.,Prabhupāda,"Now, in India, I think, people ask me the ""How many they areKṛṣṇaconscious?"" ""Everyone in India."" At least in India everyone isKṛṣṇaconscious. So the majority of people... And why majority? The whole India. Even there are many Mohammedans who also worshipKṛṣṇa. So ifKṛṣṇais God, we, in this conference, why not present, ""Here is God, whose name isKṛṣṇa."""
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, but understand one thing. In layer, thatKa-rish-na, when thekarcomes tosunya,at that consciousness if a person does not release to himself, he is not...",Prabhupāda,"What is that,sunya?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Sunya.,Prabhupāda,Sunya?Mean zero? God is zero?
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, it is not zero, it is where thekar,the action, stops.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:That is the Godhead.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is reaction..."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:But everybody here in this world, four billion people, everybody does not have that experience...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, I mean to say that every religious sect believes in God."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Um hm.,Prabhupāda,"If we present, ""Here is God. You are seeking after God. Here is God,"" now what they will say?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, some will say, ""Yes, it is."" Some will say, ""No.""",Prabhupāda,"Ācchā.So if he says no, ""Why do you say no? Then what is your conception of God?"""
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, that is what we want to understand basically. That's what we are talking about, one thing. Your realization about God is a very universal realization. Somebody on this human level is very limited. After all, the limited and the unlimited have to be brought together.",Prabhupāda,No. Limited cannot understand God. Limited is limited.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Um hm.,Prabhupāda,Mahātmāmeans unlimited.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Um hm.,Prabhupāda,"Mahā.Mahāmeans very great. So unless one has very big understanding, he cannot understand God. God is unlimited. So you have (to) come to that platform to understand. Those who are limited, they cannot understand God. That is not possible.Manuṣyāṇāṁsahasreṣukaścidyatatisiddhaye,yatatāmapisiddhānām[Bg.7.3].Siddha.Siddhameans one who has become unlimited,Brahman,ahaṁbrahmāsmi,Brahmanrealization. SoKṛṣṇasays,manuṣyāṇāṁsahasreṣu:""Out of many millions of person,""kaścidyatatisiddhaye,""somebody is trying to become unlimited."" Andyatatāmapisiddhānāṁ:[Bg.7.3]""Those who have become unlimited, out of millions of them, one can understand Me,Kṛṣṇa."" SoKṛṣṇaunderstanding, God understanding.... When I sayKṛṣṇa, God. God understanding is for the perfect unlimited, not for common man. Common man should accept theācāryas.They must follow.Ācāryopāsanam.Just like in India the Sikhs, they followGuruNanak. SoGuruNanak says, ""Yes,Kṛṣṇa, incarnation of God."" So they should accept, that's all. Not that every Sikh is expected to be unlimited asGuruNanak. That is not expected. But they should followGuruNanak. Then they will understand.GuruNanak says, ""Kṛṣṇa is incarnation of God."" The all the Sikhs should accept, ""Yes,Kṛṣṇais..."" Then it is all right. It is not expected that every Sikh will understandKṛṣṇa.Mahājanoyenagataḥsapanthāḥ[Cc.Madhya17.186].Themahājana,theācārya,what path they have shown, that will show. All theācāryas,they have acceptedKṛṣṇa. AndArjuna, who directly listenedBhagavad-gītāfromKṛṣṇa, he accepted,paraṁbrahmaparaṁdhāmapavitraṁparamaṁbhavān[Bg.10.12].So in this we have to follow. Otherwise it is not possible. What they will understand? They must follow theācārya.IfGuruNanak says ""I accept LordKṛṣṇaas God,"".... God's incarnation and God—there is no difference. Then why the Sikhs should not acceptKṛṣṇaas God?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:That doesn't solve the problem of the world.,Prabhupāda,"No, first of all, if we know, ""Here is God,"" then it will solve the problem. But if we do not accept... If I... I can hear from you, provided I know that you are some big man. Otherwise how shall I agree to hear from you? The obedience must be there. A student, a small child, hears the teacher because he knows that ""My teacher is very great."""
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, we may try to become limited or unlimited. Question is very simple. There are four billion people on this earth and...",Prabhupāda,"And therefore they are not expected to understand, four billion. They should follow the leader. It is not expected that..."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:That is what we are trying to do. We are going to get the leaders together.,Prabhupāda,"That leaders... the leaders are already there. Now, supposeGuruNanak says ""Kṛṣṇa is God,"" so will the Sikhs followGuruNanak or their own whims?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, no, Sikh will follow the instructions...",Prabhupāda,OfGuruNanak.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:...GuruNanak.,Prabhupāda,TheGuruNanak saysKṛṣṇais God.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:That's very true.Kṛṣṇais God.,Prabhupāda,Then why don't you follow Kṛṣṇa's instruction?
Yogi,YogiBhajan:We are not disobeying any instruction towards God.,Prabhupāda,"No,Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's... WhatKṛṣṇasays, that is written in theBhagavad-gītā.Why don't you take it,Bhagavad-gītā,that instruction? What is wrong there? Every problem is solved there. Now, so far economic... Now the question is economic. SoKṛṣṇasays,annādbhavantibhūtāni[Bg.3.14].So where is the objection? Produce food grain, and both animal and man will be happy. So who will disagree with this point? Follow this.Annādbhavantibhūtāni.Kṛṣṇasays first. This is economic. Social—Kṛṣṇasays,cātur-varṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭaṁguṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ[Bg.4.13].The human society should be divided into four classes according to quality and work. So four classes there are. First class, intelligent class; the second class, the administrators; the third class, the mercantile; and the fourth class, who are not within these three class. That is going on. Now make it systematic. The first-class man... Who is a first-class man? Then... Find out.Satyaśamodamaḥtitikṣaārjavaḥ,jñānaṁvijñānamāstikyaṁbrahma-karmasvabhāva-jam[Bg.18.42].Train first-class men. He must be truthful. He must be self-controlled, controlling the mind, controlling the senses. He must have full knowledge of the whole world,jñānaṁvijñānam,practical application. So where is the question of that ""I am Sikh,"" ""I amHindu,"" ""I am Muslim..."""
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, no, the question is very simple, what the people will ask you. Thecastesystem, what did to India...",Prabhupāda,This is notcastesystem.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:It turned into.,Prabhupāda,This is classification of the human being. This is notcastesystem. Just like we are making this American boy abrāhmaṇa.So this is abrāhmaṇacaste?
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, but that is only...",Prabhupāda,"We have been training them to, how to acquire thebrāhmaṇaqualification. It doesn't matter whether he is coming from Christian family or Mohammedan family, this... No. Just like if you train one how to become engineer, it doesn't matter from which family he comes. It doesn't matter. Any family, he can come. He can be trained how to speak truthfulness.Satyam.What is that? So..."
Devotee:,Devotee:The verse is...,Prabhupāda,Satyaśamadamaḥtitikṣa.You don't find?
Devotee:,Devotee:I thought it was the verse about the qualities of abrāhmaṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes, what is that?"
Devotee:,"Devotee:""Peacefulness, self...""",Prabhupāda,"No, no, what is the Sanskrit verse?"
Devotee:,"Devotee:The one I have is text forty-two of Chapter Eighteen, but I don't think that's the one you're quoting from.",Prabhupāda,What is the verse? You cannot read?
Devotee:,Devotee:Śamo damastapaḥ...,Prabhupāda,"Ah,śamodamaḥ,that's it. Read."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Śamo damastapaḥśaucamkṣāntirārjavamevaca,jñānamvijñānamāstikyaṁ...[Bg.18.42].",Prabhupāda,"Brahma-karmasvabhāva...this is first-class man.Śamaḥ. Śamaḥmeans controlling the sense or controlling the mind. Anddamaḥ,controlling the sense. Now, if either you may beHindu, Muslim, Christian... Now, if I say, ""Please come here. Learn this thing, how to control the mind, how to control the senses,"" so who will object to it? So if anyone is trained up, it doesn't matter from which sect, which family he is coming, if he has learned how to control the mind, how control the senses, then he becomes first-class man. So we have got everything already spoken by God. If we accept it, then there is unity. But we don't accept, we manufacture something. That is the difficulty."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, but let us agree to confer...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Your..."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:There will be difficulty.,Prabhupāda,"Our difficulty is that we don't agree. If I say, ""Come here. Be educated,"" and if you don't agree, ""No, no. I don't want,"" then how you can be educated? One must agree what God says. They will say, ""I believe. We believe."" What is the ""I believe, we believe""? If you want to become first-class man, then this is the formula: Control your mind, control your senses, be fully in knowledge. Practically apply knowledge in life. So this is first class. Then the second-class men, you see, what is that?Kṣatriya."
Devotee:,Devotee:,Prabhupāda,"Next class. First class, either you say first class orbrāhmaṇa.The second class..."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Kṣatri.,Prabhupāda,"Kṣatriya,the administrator. They have got(?)śauryam.Then what is the word,śauryam?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Heroism.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Devotee:,Devotee:Śauryam...,Prabhupāda,"Heroism. That is... Just likeMahārājaParīkṣit. He was going on his tour, and he saw one black man was trying to kill a cow. Immediately he took his sword, ""Who are you? You are trying to kill cow in my kingdom?"" This is called heroism. Now, where is that hero? And they are becoming president. How he will command? He is not hero. Everyone has right to live. Why they are killing animals? This is heroism. As soon as he saw that a rascal is going to kill a cow, ""Why you are doing this?"" Immediately he took his sword. Heroism. Then?"
Devotee:,"Devotee:""Power, determination...""",Prabhupāda,"Power. He must have power, influence. Why he should beg vote, ""Give me vote, give me vote, give me vote,"" begging? Where is power? If he is begging vote, where is power? Formerly the kings... Just like they used to take sword. ""If you don't accept me, then I shall kill you."" This is power.Śauryaṁ tejam..."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Dhṛtir,determination.",Prabhupāda,"Determination, andyuddhecaapalāyanam.Now when there is war, these politician will remain in their room safely. They will not go to the war. And why these people are voted for political post? Formerly the king would first of all stand. To the other side also, the king is there and this side also. The fight is going on. If the king is killed, then the victory is there.Yuddhecaapalāyanam.The formula is there. So these classes of man should be on the administration, not anyone coward, nonsense, and by hook and crook they get some vote and take the political leader... How you will find peace? The fourth class is required. Just like in your body you have got brain, brain is required. Then hand. Whenever there is some attack, consciously, unconsciously, I forward my hand. So the division is already there. If you come to attack me with a knife, I don't push my head. I push my hand. So when there is attack, thebrāhmaṇasare not expected to go forward; thekṣatriyas.So this is training. Everything is perfectly there. People are not accepting. You don't require conference. You simply accept the standard knowledge. Then everything is there. I am speaking to you because you are leader of the society. So if we takeBhagavad-gītāseriously and train people from all over the world —not thatBhagavad-gītāis meant for theHinduor for the Indians—for everyone, then there will be all right. Otherwise difficult..."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, I definitely agree that you must be successful in that mission now. And you have practically and honestly taught what you believed in. My idea...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. ""I honestly believe."" Why don't you honestly believe?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:I believe that you honestly believe...,Prabhupāda,But you also try.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:That's what I am saying. This is the time...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you accept thisBhagavad-gītāas the standard knowledge and preach it."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:I read it, I preach it, I understand it. That's in my concept.",Prabhupāda,That is wanted. That is wanted.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:What I am trying to reach is that this concept which you honestly believe as individual must be shared.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. I, again you take... Why ""I honestly believe""? Why you honestly do not believe?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, every honest understanding will believe that.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:There is no individuality in that...,Prabhupāda,That is wanted.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:But still there is individuality.,Prabhupāda,"No individuality. Then suppose you are leader of a group. If you honestly believe, teach them. They will accept it."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:So that is why we are having understanding, why we are to gather today at this point. Because we understand that one particle...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So if we accept, if we try to convince the people that ""We haven't got to research how to unite the whole world. The things are already there in theBhagavad-gītā.Accept it and follow it, everything will be done."""
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Come for a message then.,Prabhupāda,Message is already there. I am giving you the message.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Well, they are coming about lot of people, and they would like to understand and..., what thisKṛṣṇamovement...",Prabhupāda,"No.Yadyadācaratiśreṣṭhaḥ[Bg.3.21].If you carry this message... It is not my message; it is the message ofKṛṣṇa. I have not manufactured this message. I am imperfect. But I am presenting the perfect message. That is my business. I don't say I am perfect. I am simply carrier, peon. When a peon delivers a money order, thousand dollars, it is not his money. He simply carries. So my business is to carry Kṛṣṇa's message. That's all."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:It is very kind of you. But if you carry this message to New Mexico, to all those guys, (laughing) it will be a great joy.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:I am also carrying the message of those limited ones who want to share the unlimited ones. And that's what the whole attempt was, to provide a platform where limited, unlimited...",Prabhupāda,"No.... First of all, just like you are leader, similarly, all the leaders must accept."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yes, Swami Dhirendra...",Prabhupāda,Then the followers will accept.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Swami Dhirendra Brahmacary has flown all the way from India to just participate in that. Other people, Ācārya...",Prabhupāda,"Who is, who is that? Swami Dhirendra...?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Swami Dhirendra Brahmacary. He has flown...,Prabhupāda,"But prime ministerguru, does he believe inBhagavad-gītā?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Oh, yeah. He knows it by heart, word to word. That's true.",Prabhupāda,"So why he does not teach his disciple, followers?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:He teaches, he teaches, he teaches. He's a very good man. And there are otherācāryasand Śaṅkarācārya Math and other people are coming. We have the list in Los Angeles, about sixty who have accepted to come. Then from the Judeo-Christian thoughtway(?) people are participating. And then...",Prabhupāda,"No, they will come and they will go away, that's all."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, understand...",Prabhupāda,"There will be... There will be no understanding. I know that. There will be no understanding. You can write it down in your notebook. They will come, and they will say, and they will go away, that's all. I have dealt with all these men very nicely. You see?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:I understand the pain, but still...",Prabhupāda,"And still you may go on, taking this pain."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Effort, effort. There is nothing wrong to put that honest effort. Because lot things you can say which I cannot say.",Prabhupāda,"No, I do not say anything."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:You have seen this.,Prabhupāda,"Whatever I have said, I am quoting from theBhagavad-gītā.You have seen it. I don't say anything. I never say, ""It is my opinion,"" ""I think."" No, I never say like that."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:This style, they will look at it and like it. And there will be nobody else who can exactly present this style.",Prabhupāda,"If you like to go me, I can go there. That's all right."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, yeah, it must... It is... My basic idea is you inKṛṣṇaconsciousness can present a style which a Judeo, a rabbi, may not be in a position to do it.",Prabhupāda,That is certain. Nobody can present.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:All right. Then that guy, that guy has the love for his conviction. Where mutual convictions can meet and still create a harmony... My honest opinion is that it is the time. World has become small.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness has spread. Message ofGuruNanak has spread. Message of LordRāmahas spread. Message of Jesus has spread. Message of Moses has spread. All right. Now the spread is going to interact. And in that, somebody with this style can come in and can represent right. You will be my personal guest and you will be in a position... We will do whatever personally we can do for that whole situation. But it will be a good idea to talk to all these people, to make them understand, and from when your mouth the person will understand whyHareKṛṣṇaperson goes on the street and chant... They have got fundamental things to say. They do not know. They have different versions to hear, they have versions to talk.",Prabhupāda,"No, it is... We are chantingHareKṛṣṇamantra.That, find out the...Satataṁkīrtayantomām[Bg.9.14]."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Kali-yugamemkīrtanapradhana.NowŚrīGuruGranthasays,GuruNanak writes himself, correct versions are many, but my idea is: it is good to hear from you.",Prabhupāda,That is also stated in theBhagavad-gītā.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:I know.,Prabhupāda,
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:I would like you to meet that greatSanātana-dharmarepresentative, who will be coming.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Sanātana-dharmaPratirini(?)is sending their representative. I forget his name. It is much better he hears from you among the, among the wise.",Prabhupāda,What is that verse?
Devotee:,Devotee:,Prabhupāda,"We are doing that,HareKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays, ""Always chanting My glories."" And we are doing that—""HareKṛṣṇa."" We are not introducing anything new. That is not our business."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:So we will have the privilege to have this ancient one among us for those three days, and be there and present your style and your...",Prabhupāda,"When, when, when is..."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:June.,Prabhupāda,June.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:That is this month?,Prabhupāda,"This month, yes."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:This month, June.",Prabhupāda,New Mexico.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, hour and a half. We will receive you at Albuquerque. And we would like you to come the day the other Indian gurus are coming because we would like to receive them at the airport and we would like to have state banquet arranged for every visitors. And our basic idea is to bring understanding among all men of God. And...",Prabhupāda,Hm. It is a good idea.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:And in spite of the fact nothing may happen...,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Something will happen.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:At least, people will know you, people will have met you, people who have never met you, that way. So whosoever come will come with God will, and whosoever will do something will do something with God will. And we will enjoy the experience to be the host, and that I think is ourkarma.We must pay that.",Prabhupāda,"No, the thing is that is if we want to do something substantial, we must come on a common platform. That common platform is already there. Every line ofBhagavad-gītāis so nice..."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, but sir...",Prabhupāda,Nobody can argue on it.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:You have to provide the opportunity for those who will not have the chance to meet you to meet you. Those who have no opportunity to listen to you to listen to you. Those who have not seen you to see you. And I think that has its value. I never... I would never have gone to meet Sant Kirpal Singh. He came. And there the idea of this Unity of Man Conference was framed. And I left all the way to India, and I asked him one thing which I loved in him. He said, ""Well, I am going to die next year. You take over,"" and I said, ""Forget it, that's not my job. I'm not going to take over anything from anybody. I have to do what I have to do."" Then he said, ""Well, this is the idea. Would you try to be second with me in this time?"" I said, ""All right, I'll do that."" And in the end I almost was convinced that he is a great man. And he asked me, he said, ""You don't believe in anybody except God. Human forms are very... I understand you, I know you,"" because he knows me from very childhood. But I asked him one thing. I said, ""I have never seen a saint on whom saints believe. They all have their own territories and whole thing."" You know.",Prabhupāda,"Nāsau muniryasyamataṁnabhinnam:""He is not amuniif he does not disagree with anothermuni."""
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, that's right. (laughter) So what I told him was that ""It is a good idea."" So we are carrying that good idea now, andMuniSushila Kumar is coming from India, then Swami Chittananda is leading that tour. And they have sent a list of sixteen other religious people who are coming. They are going to U.N.O., where the peace presentation this year is happening. I think we should participate in that. Then there is a vegetarian congress. There the participation is happening. And all this has been done just to lay the platform and honor the idea of that man Kirpal Singh Sant. Just he wanted that way. So we thought it is a better idea to be in the West and with the arrangements that everybody can come, participate, talk to each other. I would like you to be in New Mexico in one of the presentable cabin, and not let anybody of these devotee of you be around but to askotherpeople to come and talk to you, learn from you, share with you, share your wisdom, share your conviction, share your experience...",Prabhupāda,"That's a good idea, very good."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:And I like all these guys to come and talk to me and when they will listen me talkingGītā,perhaps they will understand, ""Well, Yogiji knows little bit about what we know about."" So when they pronounce certain words, I just sometime correct in between, but I don't tell them anything because they know...",Prabhupāda,Where is your headquarter?
Yogi,YogiBhajan:Los Angeles. We are neighbors.,Prabhupāda,Oh. Los Angeles.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:We are almost neighbors. We are few blocks from each other.,Prabhupāda,"Now, when you have started?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:About five years ago. Six years.,Prabhupāda,Six years. We started there in the...
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:About you when it came inIllustrated Weekly,I was in India.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, oh."
Yogi,YogiBhajan:So I am very recent here. But I go toHareKṛṣṇa...,Prabhupāda,Where is your address in Los Angeles?
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah. They all come Sunday. They come to ourGuruDvaraon every Sunday. People participate. We have our magazine, and this was our anniversary renaisance, which we issued... Rather, I was planning if some of yourācāryacan come and I can give them a program forKṛṣṇaconsciousness development and authoritative human aspects ofGītā,which I teach in UCLA, they can participate and start courses in that. Because everybody is special in certain areas, and I thought that was a better idea. However...",Prabhupāda,These pictures of...?
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:This is Golden Temple, Amritsar.",Prabhupāda,Amritsar.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Five years ago we had a one-paper print. We used to give it away for five cents. That developed into a paper. This is how everything develops. And my basic idea is people must share. And why not come there, participate, share, say what you have to say? It is one of the funny coincidence that we both live in Culver City. We live very adjoining to each other. And I go to your temple, see how it is made and how they are doing and what kind of marble they are using. And I have a lot of things to criticize but... You know. They are messing it up, but they are spending a lot of money. (laughter) So I don't mind what they are doing, but it is really a waste, lot of it is waste. I go and watch and it hurts me. But I just go around see, after all. You must have very wise architects.",Prabhupāda,They are very expert in wasting. (laughter)
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Yeah, that I have seen. That is totally what annoys me sometime and then I go and ""Well, say you have to learn this way. It doesn't matter."" Now, the Mexico marble has a flower arranged in it. Everybody has two eyes, and that flower arrange can be arranged, and none of your persons, in spite of my... One day I yelled at them and say, ""I am going to pull your out of your this little hair, and what are you doing, waste of time?"" They said, ""Well, we have to ask somemahātmā,someācārya.Someone will tell him the message."" I went again next day. They did it exactly what was wrong. But you know, they are kids. They will learn. So I go and poke my nose all the time because I thought if I can tell them, they will do it better. But my basic situation is we are doing...",Prabhupāda,"The Americans, they have no value for their money."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:No, no, nothing.",Prabhupāda,Therefore they can waste very lavishly.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:But they are very beautiful people. One of the girl there in your organization almost brought tears to my eyes. And it is very seldom I have tears, and I love them when they come. And she said to me, she just came and hugged me. ""Oh, Yogiji, I love you, you came."" I said, ""Oh, don't tell anybody. I just want to go around. And I want to run away."" So she knows me. And she took me to her one store where there where a lot of books, and she asked me to have some books, and some of them I had, some I didn't. So I picked up. And she said, ""You know, we were raised like dogs. Now we are being raised like gods. You think this old man, our god, is going to stay with us?"" You know, she is very young in your organization. I said, ""What are you talking, a old man?"" She said, ""Our Prabhupāda."" Then she took your whole name with reverence. And I looked in her eyes. I said, ""Look, my dear daughter, if that man has taught you so much love, then you will never be separated. Keep doing what you are doing. You will be all right."" There is devotion. There is a power to learn. There is a power to gain. They have many faults, but they have many merits also. I think it is a time to present them, as they perform of the humanist to the whole world. And that will take away a lot of misunderstandings.",Prabhupāda,"No, misunderstanding, there are... That will continue. You see?"
Yogi,YogiBhajan:I hundred percent agree. When we wanted to join the...,Prabhupāda,Especially in the Western countries they had misunderstanding with Christ so that they crucified him. You see? So this is the...
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:We can do all that, and still, it will be useful.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, we can... We can advise."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Your visit will be useful, and it will be very divine to come with a message, with a conviction. You know, I have come to this conference here.",Prabhupāda,Which conference?
Yogi,YogiBhajan:That Rainbow Festival.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, what is that?"
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:Metaphysical, psychics, intuitives, people who can perform things. They are all in God. I was surprised last night that A to Z, everybody talks about God, and none of them understands that the God is right in them. So I was one among them. It did change the whole thing. I honestly believe that it was very good for me to come. If I would have gone to the equals, where if I find some equal, it would not have done any good, you know. They all know what they know. We all know that what we know. But it was amazing that people liked it, people talked, people asked questions, people... Whatever I could share, I shared. But in the evening I was surprised. There were two hundred people, beautiful, seeking some way or the other, and looking for certain things for their life. So my only idea was that I have never worked less than these five, six days. It was very boring for me. There was no work. But I liked it. At least, I could share with them; they could share with me. First they were all doubtful what ayogiis, what ayogais. I said, ""Well, it is... After all, they were not asking me a yogurt. So there is a safety. So people, when people see you theyhateyou, they find you are different, that you taught something which you taught. They don't like it. They don't want to hear it. And gradually, gradually, gradually, it brings them to understanding. So I, my personal request, and on behalf of all those who are coming, I would like you to visit us if you possibly can and...",Prabhupāda,Give someprasāda.
Yogi,YogiBhajan:And this is... Because this is time of the world where love has to prevail from the higher and from the lower equal.,Prabhupāda,Put it here. (Prasādais distributed; Prabhupāda speaks a bit in Hindi)
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:All these young people walk into theāśramas,and any time, middle of night, they are always received. That understanding exists anywhere. Nobody has issued them any instructions. But they go with each other very well. Some of our boys who started with us inyogaclasses are member of theHareKṛṣṇamovement. Sometime we get on telephone. I say, ""At least, you are somewhere. It's all right. Take care of yourself. Keep up."" So life is going on as it has to go on.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is nice."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:But there is a lot of mutual love, understanding. And after all, this is a discipline. All can't have this discipline. Those who can have it, they can have it. (Hindi) Understanding is there,pralabhais there, will of God is there. God wants us, we are the pawns of it. But it will be a great joy. So I will ask for your leave. It's my pleasure.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, thank you very much for your coming. Give him our literature,Back to Godhead."
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:(Hindi:)Namaskara.And we will, we will get you, receive you, and it will be our privilege. After all, you are our elder. Don't forget that. Thank you.HareKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,Jaya.
Yogi,"YogiBhajan:And now these people forget sometimes theirHareRāma, why? (Hindi) (guests are leaving) Thank you very much. (tape continues as guests leave, sound of car driving away, devotees talking in background)",Prabhupāda,They are gone?
Paramahaṁsa,"Yes, they just left.",Prabhupāda,This is our or their?
Paramahaṁsa,"I know one devotee who was a... There was one devotee who was a disciple of him before he came to us. He used to live withYogiBhajanabout ten years ago inSanFrancisco. Not ten years ago, about eight, nine years ago inSanFrancisco. And he said that when he first came, he was a professor from India. But then he associated with the hippies for some time and became a...",Prabhupāda,He was Indian?
Paramahaṁsa,"Yeah, he's from India. You meanYogiBhajanor the devotee?",Prabhupāda,"No, the devotee."
Paramahaṁsa,"No, the devotee, I think the devotee isRāmeśvara.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Paramahaṁsa,Rāmeśvaraused to be (laughs)YogiBhajan's disciple.,Prabhupāda,Oh. Why he left him?
Paramahaṁsa,"(laughs) Because he, I think because he met you. He was his disciple, and then he became a devotee ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness afterwards, by Kṛṣṇa's grace. But he saidYogiBhajanwas too much associating with women.",Prabhupāda,That is...
Paramahaṁsa,Yes. That was the...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,"Many devotees, they put it in the sun when it becomes dead. Is that all right to tighten the head? (referring tomṛdaṅga)",Prabhupāda,(inaudible)YogiBhajan... did he come here?
Paramahaṁsa,"At most eight years, seven or eight years.",Prabhupāda,So less than we are.
Paramahaṁsa,"They have, in Phoenix, Arizona, they have a very nice place, very large building.",Prabhupāda,Where?
Paramahaṁsa,"Phoenix, Arizona. It's similar to our Los Angeles branch. I think they tried to make... They have buildings, block buildings nearby, apartments for householders. In many ways they are imitating our movement.",Prabhupāda,But there is no Deity?
Bali,"Bali-mardana:No, they worship the... (end)",Prabhupāda,"...devotees are described assiddha-sattva-maṇi,siddha-sattva-maṇi.[break]"
Harikeśa,I haven't listened to it all though. That's why the tapes aren't done. [break],Prabhupāda,"...people, by not believing in the next life, they have dismissed all problems. Very happy life."
Bali,"Bali-mardana:They have one saying, ""Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you'll die.""",Prabhupāda,"That's right. Very good civilization. [break]... Aryan civilization. This is not Aryan civilization. Barbarian. [break] A small child, he knows that ""I shall become like my elder brother. I shall get this body, next body."" And these people, they cannot understand that there is next body. That means their civilization is less than a child's civilization. [break] ...hantaraprāptiḥ."
Bali,"Bali-mardana:Even every child knows that ""When I grow up I will have a different body,""...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bali,Bali-mardana:...but they do not know.,Prabhupāda,"These people, they do not understand. What kind of civilized men they are? Less than a child, and they are proud of their science. [break]"
Devotee:,Devotee:They're fishing.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Devotee:,Devotee:Crabs. [break],Prabhupāda,"...fisherman. They keep this side open and this side covered. Front side covered, back side open. (end)"
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:...talking in the car on the way over, the other day you said thatGovindadāsī, she had asked you if in general that we would have to take birth in India before going back home and you said yes. So we were wondering (laughter) how that's possible that we have to take birth in India. Because we see that they're not very strict Vaiṣṇavas there. So what is it...",Prabhupāda,The land is there.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Land is... Just like this land,Vaiṣṇavais there. This land is not meant for spiritual culture but still the Vaiṣṇavas are there. Similarly, in India, no, there are many Vaiṣṇavas there. The mass of people, they are allVaiṣṇava."
Paramahaṁsa,So by joining this movement we come to the platform where we can take birth in India in a nicebrāhmaṇafamily?,Prabhupāda,"No, you can go directly also, if you want to finish your business.Śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgehe[Bg.6.41].This is a consideration, who, one who fails in executing. But if you become successful, then you go directly whereKṛṣṇais there.Kṛṣṇais there in some universe. So those who are completely liberated, they go to that universe. Just like whenKṛṣṇacomes here, in each and every universe there is aVṛndāvana. So in thatVṛndāvanaone takes birth. Then goes to originalVṛndāvana. [break]"
Paramahaṁsa,"Those who are not able to maintain theKṛṣṇaconsciousness principle, then they may have to go to India next lifetime.",Prabhupāda,"Yes.Śrīmatam,śrīmatāṁśucīnāṁ."
Paramahaṁsa,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Sośrīmatāṁ,you can get here.Śrīmatammeans rich, rich family. Here you get many families, Ford family... Butśrīmatāṁandśucīnāṁ.So if you are creating so manybrāhmaṇas,so if this cult is permanent, then there will be manybrāhmaṇafamily here also. [break]"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:...someone had asked me yesterday. You say that the moon is self-luminous. So then... But during the course of the month there are times when only part of the moon is showing. The moon is not always full.,Prabhupāda,Maybe some planet between. Maybe due to sun. So moon is above the sun. Above the sun.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:They call them rain birds.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Rain birds.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:They like to stay near the clouds.,Prabhupāda,Above the clouds?
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Just below the clouds usually.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. [break] ...Siddhaloka the residents, men, they also can fly. Siddhaloka. They can go from one planet to another by flying. [break] ...eating, they come down, these birds?"
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Do they come down to eat?,Prabhupāda,For eating?
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:I've never seen them on the ground. I think they might be eating something in the rain. There's actually particles in the rain. Isn't there?,Prabhupāda,"There is a bird,cataka.They drink rain water."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"The example is given, thesecatakabirds, they want water from the cloud and they will never come down to take water, take water down. Similarly, devotees will simply depend onKṛṣṇa. They'll not accept anything from this material world. [break] Example is given that sometimes the cloud, instead of giving water, gives thunderbolt. Still, they will not take water from down. That is acataka.Although it is... Sometimes they are punished—instead of water, they are given thunderbolt—but still, they will not take any."
Harikeśa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was wondering if it was more important to understand the universal make up or simply to accept whatŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamsays.",Prabhupāda,That means you don't acceptŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam?
Harikeśa,No. But some of the things inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamare difficult to understand.,Prabhupāda,"Rascal, fool. Therefore it is difficult for you."
Harikeśa,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"You should not... You understand or not understand, you have to accept it."
Harikeśa,That is why we are asking so many questions about the moon and the planets.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, so where is the doubt? It is a fact that they did not go to the moon. That's a fact."
Harikeśa,I'm just trying to understand for preaching purposes.,Prabhupāda,Why do you try to understand?
Harikeśa,Because I have a hard time explaining about the make up of the universe as far as...,Prabhupāda,"That make up is all right, what they say?"
Harikeśa,What they say?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Harikeśa,No.,Prabhupāda,"Then don't understand them also, you don't understand here also. Then what you will do?"
Harikeśa,"Well, the difficulty I was having about this mountain, thisMeru. It sounds... It's very difficult to explain that to someone.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, that is difficult, but everything is difficult for you. Because you want to see. You have not seen their arrangement; neither you have seen our arrangement. So but your proposition is you don't believe what you don't see. You have not seen neither of them, so you have to remain silent."
Harikeśa,So the best position is just remain silent until realization comes?,Prabhupāda,"No. You should... Śukadeva Gosvāmī says. You have to believe that. It is an idea. If you believe or not believe, it doesn't matter. But you can get an idea about the planetary situation. That's all. Neither you can go there; neither you can see it. An idea is given, that is all. But there is no argument."
Harikeśa,No.,Prabhupāda,No.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Did the people who said they went to the moon, did they go to another planet?",Prabhupāda,Yes. Or they did not go anywhere. They were in the desert... What is that?
Devotees:,Devotees:Arizona.,Prabhupāda,Arizona. That's all. That is possible.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Yes, it's possible. I wouldn't put anything beyond them.",Prabhupāda,They are all doing this nonsense here on this planet and showing and advertising that.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Yes, they made big propaganda that they would get there, and then they had to succeed. And then they showed that they succeeded, they stopped the program.",Prabhupāda,That one film?
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:Oh, King Kong. (laughter)",Prabhupāda,King Kong. It was made in laboratory.
Devotee:,"Devotee:Someone was arguing with me that if, like Russia and America both are enemies, if Russia achieves something great like going to the moon, America will immediately try to expose it. But on the contrary, America accepted all those things. And because...",Prabhupāda,"Then there is also... Both of them are thieves, they have made agreement, ""Don't expose me. I'll not expose you."""
Devotee:,Devotee:So that is their agree... But they are enemies...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, enemies, they are not enemies. They are simply rogues and thieves, that's all."
Bali,Bali-mardana:Honor among thieves.,Prabhupāda,"""Thief, thief, cousin brother.""Coracora, pasurabhai.So far our position is that we are not concerned with anything with this universe. We are concerned with Kṛṣṇaloka. So whatever one may say, one other may say, we don't care for that. We are not going to the moon planet, Jupiter(?) planet."
Harikeśa,"So our preaching platform should be is that ""You don't know."" We can say, ""You don't know"" or ""We don't know. Why shouldn't one accept what we say over what you say?"" We should just prove that we...",Prabhupāda,"No, accept or not accept, the whatever is description there, inBhāgavatam,we are accepted."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Why not on the platform of not being the body? Why should you...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Why not speak on what we're trying to speak about instead of overly indulge in that which is beyond debate actually?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Ask them, ""Are you the body?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" and then ask them to show how...",Prabhupāda,"Just like here in America I have come to preachKṛṣṇaconsciousness. I am not interested for sight-seeing. That is not my business. Whatever you say, ""It is here like this,"" ""All right, That's all, finished."" Why should we try to confirm it? Whatever you say, that's all right. Now, we are seeing the other part; if somebody there, ""It is like this,"" that's all right. I'm not going to test it. So what is the use of arguing? I have no interest."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:The materialists, they want to argue on the platform of material arrangements, and there's...",Prabhupāda,That is useless.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"What he will gain by such argument? You are not going there neither you are interested for going to the moon planet. For knowledge sake it is stated in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and everyone is... Just like when we speak of the hell, everyone is little anxious, ""Where are the hell?"" So that is described. In the down this universe there arelokas."
Harikeśa,"So, in other words, it would make no... It would be not a very good program to get some understanding from Vedic astronomy, like, say, some expert Vedic astronomers.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Harikeśa,It would not be a good program...?,Prabhupāda,"No, what benefit you will derive there? Your problem is that if at the time of death you can rememberKṛṣṇa, then it is success. We are not going to any other planet.Yāntideva-vratādevān[Bg.9.25],let them go. We are not interested in these things."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:There's only a certain amount of time and a certain amount of..., that we can talk about to people. And if we're talking about so many material arrangements, then it means that we can't be talking about that which is actually important. So we have to make a choice, whether we're going to get straight to the point or beat around the bush. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...no interest in a particular subject, why should you bother your head about it?"
Harikeśa,I become very fascinated when I read these descriptions inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamabout the creation and the universal...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. That's gist idea of the universal position. That is sufficient."
Harikeśa,"So, in other words, Śukadeva Gosvāmī is always bringingMahārājaParīkṣitto the platform of ""Why bother with all of this? Simply perform devotional service""?",Prabhupāda,"Huh? No, no. He's giving full knowledge of the universal affairs. He also says at the end that ""I have described whatever I have heard."" That's all."
Harikeśa,So we should simply describe it without being concerned that the scientific mind may make sense out of it or not?,Prabhupāda,"What is this nonsense scientific? That is... We reject immediately. What is scientific? A tiny brain, what is their science?Phenebaredhakenateute.A snake catcher... There is a kind of snake which has no poison. So he cannot catch even that non-poisonous snake, and he's trying to catch one cobra. So these scientists, what is their value? What they have done anything contribution to the world for the benefit of the human society? They could not give any relief from the disease, relief from old age, relief from death or birth. These are the real problems. So what is their contribution? They have given some horseless carriage. Again there is problem of power. What is actually benefit they have done, that this is the benefit from the scientists? Anything they have done, there is counter disadvantage. This is simply waste of time. Our... We consider our human life is very valuable, and before the next death we should prepare ourself go back to home, back to Godhead. This is our philosophy. We cannot waste a minute time before the next death comes. That is our philosophy. So why should we waste our time, ""Where is the moon? Where is sun?"" Just have it gist idea, that's all. [break] ...no profit. Suppose the position of the moon is correct according toBhāgavataor according to the scientist, what benefit we shall get out of it? Whichever may be correct or wrong."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Yes, right.",Prabhupāda,"We are not getting any profit out of it. So why should we bother about it?Adharavapare jaj akalara.We are dealing in ginger. Then what is the use of asking, ""What is the hire, I mean to say, freight for a big ship?"" If you are dealing with ginger, ginger is not sold by tons. When you go to purchase ginger, you take one or two pieces. So those who are dealing in ginger, what is the use of asking what is the fare of a freight ship? We are not going to..."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:It doesn't have anything to do... [break],Prabhupāda,"...be done by Darwin, that he will live for fifty years; he is giving account millions of years. ""Some millions of years after, this evolution takes place like this.""Huh? Will he live for millions of years? Why he's talking of millions of years? This is a waste of time. He will live for fifty years or, say, utmost, hundred years, and he's talking of millions of years."
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:Just like that man who wrote the letter yesterday. He's prepared to spend the rest of his life understanding the transfer, the transmigration of the soul instead of just accepting it in theGītā.He's going to spend his whole life.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. His non-acceptance means he's a rascal. He's a rascal. He may waste his time in that way. What can be done? His non-acceptance means he's a rascal. It's evident. Anyone knows that ""After this, I will get another body."" You are all young men. You know that you will get after some years a body like me. So what is the difficulty to understand that we are changing body?"
Paramahaṁsa,So actually it's useless to try to give any more proof other than that.,Prabhupāda,That is sufficient for an intelligent man. That is sufficient.
Paramahaṁsa,"So if a scientist or someone who has some degree in science comes to our movement, should we encourage him to try to prove through science theKṛṣṇaconscious principle of transmigration and eternal quality of the soul?",Prabhupāda,Not necessary. Not necessary.
Paramahaṁsa,Better if he just...,Prabhupāda,"It is not that if we prove scientifically there is soul, if there is scientific proof, not that all the people of the world will becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, even if you do that. So it is useless. You simply understand what is stated byKṛṣṇa."
Harikeśa,Can a material calculation prove a spiritual fact?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Harikeśa,Can a material calculation prove...,Prabhupāda,No. Materialists cannot understand spiritual subject matter. It is not for them.
Harikeśa,So there is a project in Los Angeles where some psychologists are examining all the devotees.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Harikeśa,Some psychologists are there. They are doing a laboratory test on all the devotees.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, he may study in his own way, but he will not profit."
Harikeśa,"He will not profit. So this, the findings, even if they are published will not profit?",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Harikeśa,The findings? They are going to...,Prabhupāda,So what is their findings? The devotees are working on the soul platform but he does not know what is soul.
Harikeśa,"They're really far out. Actually, they're crazy...",Prabhupāda,The psychology is on the mental platform.
Harikeśa,Yes.,Prabhupāda,So what he will understand about spiritual platform?
Harikeśa,Actually they can't. They put these little things around fingers with wires and heads and they find that the readings are...,Prabhupāda,And our devotees also agreed to sit down like that?
Harikeśa,"Every week they go, and every week another man comes, and they give all of these tests, psychological tests. We would say yes or no to different questions, material questions.",Prabhupāda,So why do they agree to?
Harikeśa,"They're being, more or less, forced to.",Prabhupāda,Forced?
Harikeśa,"But actually, that's not true because some...",Prabhupāda,"That transcendental meditation, that is a bogus humbug. So they are making experiment. So in that way it is good for us, that they're better than transcendental meditation."
Upendra,"No, but this is... Dharmādhyakṣa was... He did it. The same result, they have to act the same way. They have to chant theirjapanicely. And then the transcendental meditationist will meditate his way. But the results are coming out better inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Dharmādhyakṣa, at least, andGurudāsasaid so I'm not sure. It hasn't been working yet.",Prabhupāda,"In the Bhagavad-gītāit is said that beyond the senses, the mind is there. Beyond the mind, the intelligence is there. Beyond the intelligence, the soul is there. So they are studying the mind. They are not even on the intelligence platform, and what to speak of spiritual platform?Mano-rathenaasato dhavato,bahiḥ.These rascals, those who are on the mental plane, they will remain materialists. That's all. They will not know, understand anything spiritual."
Harikeśa,"So even if someone were to read the results of such a test, it would not convince them.",Prabhupāda,What...? What you...?
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:They're testing after a material thing. Try to understand it. They're testing the mental plane and they're thinking that that's the spiritual plane.,Prabhupāda,"Their position is described in theBhagavad-gītā,avajānantimāṁmūḍhā.These rascals,avajānanti,I mean to say, cares a fig forKṛṣṇa, ""Oh,Kṛṣṇais also a very big man, that's all."" Just theAryaSamaji says in India, that ""We don't accept Him as God, but He is a very big man, a very big politician, like that."" So that is described in theBhagavad...,avajānantimāṁmūḍhāmānuṣīṁtanumāśritam,paraṁbhāvamajānanto[Bg.9.11].Theparaṁbhāvam,what is the actual significance, that is, they do not know. What is the actual significance of the soul and soul platform, spiritual..., that they do not know. They are studying from the mental platform. So they have to go beyond mental platform,avāṅmānasa-gocara,beyond bodily mental platform. Then they will understand."
Harikeśa,So we shouldn't bother with such tests?,Prabhupāda,No.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:By submitting to them we're actually... We're endorsing that they are dealing with the spiritual.,Prabhupāda,"When they come first of all, you have to inform them that ""We are working on the platform of the soul. What do you know about the soul?"""
Harikeśa,This psychologist has become a devotee.,Prabhupāda,That is another thing. He might have failed in his mental working in the mental plane. Then he has come. That is another thing.
Harikeśa,But still he wants to try and proveKṛṣṇaconsciousness through this psychological testing.,Prabhupāda,"No, what he will prove, psychological...? Psychological means mental plane. How he will understand soul from the mental platform? That is not possible."
Bali,"Bali-mardana:What they want to know is the effect of the, the effect on the mind of the soul.",Prabhupāda,"Effect will be good. As soon as one is on the platform of the soul, the intelligence, mind, body, everything will be good."
Bali,Bali-mardana:That is what they are studying.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is another thing. Just like if you get millions of dollars, ten dollars is already there. You haven't got to endeavor for ten dollars. Similarly, if one who is on the platform of soul...Yasminvijñātesarvamevaṁvijñātaṁbhavati(MuṇḍakaUpaniṣad1.3).If you understand the platform of soul, then you understand the other platforms: the intellectual platform, mental platform, bodily platform. And platform of knowledge,pratyakṣa, parakṣa, aparakṣa,adhokṣaja,aprakṛta.Soaprakṛtais this platform of the soul. Kṛṣṇa's activities, that isaprakṛta,completely far beyond these material ideas, material platform. Material platform,pratyakṣa.Just like you want to see the arrangement. That ispratyakṣa.Thenaparakṣa,accepting the authority's version.Pratyakṣa, parakṣa.Thenaparakṣa,thenadhokṣaja,beyond your mental speculation. Thenaprakṛta,spiritual. Spiritual platform is not understood by machine, material machine. Then what is the spiritual platform?Kṛṣṇais understood not by machine.Kṛṣṇasays,bhaktyāmāmabhijānāti:[Bg.18.55] ""Through devotion only."" So devotion is not machine. That is spiritual activity."
Harikeśa,So you cannot understand the consciousness of a devotee by testing his body.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Harikeśa,You cannot understand the consciousness of a devotee by testing his body or his mind.,Prabhupāda,"No, consciousness means... That is mental platform. Consciousness is also in different platform, bodily consciousness, mental consciousness, intellectual consciousness, then spiritual consciousness.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness is spiritual consciousness."
Harikeśa,So there is no way they can understand. No way.,Prabhupāda,"How they will understand? First of all let them explain what does he mean by soul? That they cannot explain. They take mind as the ultimate, that's all."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Yes. And they see whether or not the mind is moving like this or like this or like this or like that, and then they have a gauge which says, ""This is perfect."" So they're seeing... They're judging whether or not...",Prabhupāda,"But we say, ""Any position on the mental platform, it is all nonsense.""Mano-rathenasato dhavatobahiḥ."
Harikeśa,So the mind of a devotee is based on the activities of his spiritual practices.,Prabhupāda,"Mind of a devotee is uponKṛṣṇa. So what they will understand, that mind is inKṛṣṇa? What they will understand?"
Harikeśa,"So according to different transcendental emotions, the mind will be agitated or calm or...?",Prabhupāda,It is not mind. It is spirit soul. You also do not understand.
Harikeśa,That's a fact.,Prabhupāda,"Spiritual platform is different. But the spiritual activities expressed through mind, through body, through intelligence. That's it."
Harikeśa,"Yes. So that will bewilder them, this expression.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Harikeśa,"This expression through the..., it will bewilder them.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:See, the materialist is seeing that everyone is agitated, so the goal in their life is cessation of that agitation. They want to merge or cease their existence. They want to go into nothingness. So...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is their..."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:...this is what they're looking for. The transcendental meditator goes in so that the gauge doesn't make any motion. But a rock, if you put that same gauge on a rock it also doesn't make motion. Does that mean the rock is spiritual or that he's more advanced than someone else?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:You see? They're saying that perfection is no motion. They're saying that perfection is inactivity. So they already have in their mind what they think is perfect, and then they're going to see if this method helps a person to achieve calmness or whatever they're calling perfection.",Prabhupāda,"That is thatBuddhaphilosophy,nirvāṇa.Nirvāṇa,stop all activities.Buddhaphilosophy."
Harikeśa,"So someone who's actually following the scientific method, when he comes up to these bewildering conclusions about a devotee, he will be forced to inquire into the spiritual consciousness? Therefore we might be able to say this is a bona fide thing.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Harikeśa,"Because they are bewildered—they will see the conclusions, they are bewildered—they will then have to inquire further, ""Well, why is this? Why is this?"" They will have to come to the spiritual platform to understand.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Harikeśa,"No, they even admit they're bewildered.",Prabhupāda,"The reply was given by Socrates. He was condemned to death. So the judges inquired, ""Mr. Socrates, what kind of grave you will like?"" So he answered, ""First of all, catch me. Then talk of grave."" (laughter) So..."
Paramahaṁsa,Śrīla Prabhupāda...,Prabhupāda,"They are not on the spiritual platform, so all their studies are useless. They are studying with a pre-concept idea."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Right. So that when you don't fit into their preconceived idea...,Prabhupāda,"It is called, in logic it is calledprititio principia(?).So it is useless."
Paramahaṁsa,"In our movement, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we have that group of scientists who are preparing that book,The Origin of Life,but will they actually be able to prove anything through that book?",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Paramahaṁsa,Will they actually be able to prove anything by scientific presentation or...?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is science. If you can prove it by experiment. Otherwise, it is not science, theory."
Paramahaṁsa,But how can they prove the existence of the soul through experiment?,Prabhupāda,"No, first of all let them prove by chemical composition they can produce life. Then we shall talk of soul. First of all let them, in the laboratory, let the chemicals be mixed up and produce a small ant. Then we shall understand."
Harikeśa,They can make these little amoebas but they can't make ants.,Prabhupāda,"Amoebas, that is automatically... By perspiration it comes out. There are four sources of life:udbija, jarayuja, svedaja,and, what is other?Andaja. Andajameans life comes from the egg. That is calledandaja. And life comes from, under certain circumstances... Just like trees, grass. It is calledudbija. And thenjarayaja,just like we human beings or animals, they come from the embryo. Andsvedaja. And some living entities come out from perspiration."
Harikeśa,So they were saying in this experiment they made that they completely...,Prabhupāda,"Four kinds of generating process is there. So what they have studied? That germs come out perspiration, that is already accepted in theVedas.Under certain circumstances the germs come by, what is called? Scientific name?"
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:I don't know.,Prabhupāda,"Just like bugs, bed bugs. Due to your perspiration of the body, the bed being unclean, they come."
Harikeśa,"So the capability was already there in like seed, and you just watered it.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Harikeśa,"So when they said they created life in this laboratory experiment, the capability...",Prabhupāda,But that also they cannot do. That also they cannot do.
Harikeśa,But the capability was there and they just watered it. They...,Prabhupāda,What is the capability?
Harikeśa,There was one of these four circumstances for life in that test...,Prabhupāda,"Potency, that is potency."
Harikeśa,Yeah. And they just made the circumstance proper so that life came.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Harikeśa,That is their big thing on the path to becoming God.,Prabhupāda,"For the time being, let them be kicked by the God's servant, that's all. Then some day they will become God. For the time being, let them be kicked. That's all."
Harikeśa,Actually the whole field of psychology is going towardsyoga.,Prabhupāda,Yoga?
Harikeśa,"So we went to a convention two weeks ago, and they were all doing their scientific experiments, and they were trying so many different methods to enjoy sex life and be happy, and then the last day we had a bigkīrtanafor two and a half hours. And all of these people who were so frustrated by all of their other methods came, psychologists and professors and chairmens of department, and little old ladies, and they were all jumping up and down in ecstasy for two and a half hours.",Prabhupāda,Just see.
Harikeśa,"And they said, ""Oh, this is the best process. Because this is joyful realization."" They said, ""You people really have something here.""",Prabhupāda,"So in that way, if they understand, that is good."
Harikeśa,Also they lovedprasādam.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. That they are realizing, that how these hippies, they have given up everything, and they are now enjoyingsaṅkīrtana.That they are realizing. Because they know most of our devotees coming from the hippie community. So they are surprised, ""How the hippies they have given up everything and they're enjoyingsaṅkīrtana?""That is already their problem, another, that ""There must be something."" Therefore these big, big professors study. [break]"
Harikeśa,"...one place inCaitanya-caritāmṛtawhereKṛṣṇadāsaKavirājasays that ""You mental speculators, put your speculation toCaitanyaMahāprabhu."" He says something like that. If you were to speculate, speculate aboutCaitanyaMahāprabhu, the greatness ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu.",Prabhupāda,I don't think there is anything.
Harikeśa,Analyze?,Prabhupāda,"Caitanyer dayārkathākaravicāra:""Just analyze the merciful contribution ofCaitanyaMahāprabhuwith others."" That you have already experienced, that they experimented in so many ways, but as soon as they come toCaitanyaMahāprabhu's mercy,saṅkīrtana,they become immediately, ""Oh, this is the nicest thing.""

They've gone to Buddhist monks and various people that are into voidism, and they've made these tests, and it comes out that there's no activity. So they're seeing this as being the goal. They're trying to see if the same perfection, result of perfection, is achieved by the chanting. They already have a preconceived notion of what perfection is, and if they're testing to see if...",Prabhupāda,To that standard.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Yeah, if we're up to that standard of perfection of the Buddhist monks or the Zen monks or transcendental meditators or whatever. So I think it's a very bad thing to take part in that thing.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Because they'll simply try to... Anyway, it's... [break] Sometimes because these people have big titles like psychologist or professor and they have many machines and authoritative looking instruments, we become deceived into thinking that they are authorities of some sort, and we let them dictate to us. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...do not study that why these devotees have given up intoxication, which the government failed to stop?"
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,It is practical.
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Yeah, it's an easy enough thing to study.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:It's an easy thing to study, simple.",Prabhupāda,"Why these devotee, they have given up intoxication? Apart from other items, the government, especially in U.S.A., they are spending millions of dollars to stop this intoxication, L.S.D. So why they have failed? And whyKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement has become successful? What is the psychology?"
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:It seems that these people don't know how to be simple.,Prabhupāda,"Well, they no spiritual information. That is the... Therefore the first education is to understand what is spirit. Then spiritual knowledge is... They do not know what is spirit. [break]...imānibhūtānibhavanti.That is spirit, the original source of everything. This body, original source is the spirit. As soon as the spirit is not there, the body will not grow. They are seeing actually. Therefore the original source is the spirit. Why the dead child does not grow? Or dead young man does not grow? They have not studied still, what is the cause? If it is chemical, then inject some chemical, if you know it, and make it grow. Is there any... Why they cannot do it? Why do they say it is chemical? Chemical you have got in your possession. So inject the dead child and it will grow, then it is correct. And where is that? Simply bogus propaganda. And we have to accept it? Either they must say that ""Yes, it is chemical, but we did not find that chemical."""
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:So they have to admit their failure.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:So that means they're not sure it's a chemical.,Prabhupāda,Then?
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:If they say they haven't found it, they have to admit that they're not sure.",Prabhupāda,"Why do they not inject chemical in the dead body?Harikeśa? What is their answer, these rascals' answers? If they know it is out of chemical, then inject that chemical in the dead body and let him come back again in life. What do they say?"
Harikeśa,They're a little puzzled about that one.,Prabhupāda,"Puzzled means they are rascals. Why a scientist should be puzzled? Then you are rascal, admit it. If I know my business correct, why shall I be puzzled? That means rascal. You are rascal, and you are theorizing only. What is the value of your statement?"
Harikeśa,"Well, they will say there's a slight difference and that slight difference is enough.",Prabhupāda,But you do not know what is that slight difference.
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:It is a slight difference. The soul is missing. (laughs),Prabhupāda,If the chemical is missing you can replace the chemical.
Harikeśa,"Yes, there's just a slight difference with some of the chemicals...",Prabhupāda,What is that difference? That also you cannot explain.
Harikeśa,Well they haven't found it yet.,Prabhupāda,"Well, that's it still they are talking of chemical... They did not find what is the original cause; still, they are suggesting this is the cause."
