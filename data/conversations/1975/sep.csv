Brahmānanda,Infected to?,Prabhupāda,"Syphilis, yes. So in India the syphilis is very horrible disease. So he exclaimed, ""Oh, it is horrible."" The doctor, that Colonel Maylow(?), he was astonished: ""Why you say it is horrible? In your country they suffer, 90%, from malaria. That's not horrible?"" So the example is that when you are suffering for a doctor, either you are suffering from malaria or from syphilis, we are suffering from disease. Why you say ""This disease is horrible than that disease""? Actually this is the fact. Why should you discriminate? So he chastised him that ""As a medical man, you cannot say this disease is more dangerous than that. Every disease is dangerous."" Actually you should take that. Suffering, three kinds of suffering—adhyātmika, adhibhautika...The suffering is there. If you sayadhyātmikasuffering is better thanadhibhautikasuffering, that is foolishness.Atyantika-duḥkha-nivṛttiḥ.Spiritual life means to end all kinds of suffering. That is spiritual life. Not that I get free myself from this kind of suffering and I accept that kind of suffering. This is not good conclusion.Atyantika-duḥkha. Duḥkhālayamaśāśvatam[Bg.8.15].This place isduḥkhālayam,full of miseries. AndKṛṣṇais canvassing, ""Why you are suffering? Come to Me."" This mercantile community, they are earning money for mitigating suffering, but for earning money they are accepting any means. In future he is creating field of another suffering. That he does not know. He thinks, ""Now, if I get money somehow or other, my present sufferings will be mitigated."" But he does not know that he is creating another field of suffering."
Brahmānanda,In the next life.,Prabhupāda,"Next life or this life. Suppose you are earning money in the black market. As soon as you will be arrested, you will be pun... Just like so many people are put into jail. Why they are put into jail? They have done something, big, big leaders."
Brahmānanda,In the past. They have done something in the past and now they are suffering.,Prabhupāda,"""In the past"" means in this life. So as soon as you do something wrong, you must suffer, either by government's laws or by nature's law."
Brahmānanda,"They're thinking that ""If I earn much money now, then later on in my life, everything will be very comfortable.""",Prabhupāda,"That's all right, but this is the fact. If you earn money by black market and if you are arrested, then your all comfort will be finished."
Aksayananda:,Aksayananda:In theKṛṣṇabook there is one king...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Aksayananda:,"Aksayananda:He says, ""I worked so hard for enjoyment, but I have no time to enjoy.""",Prabhupāda,"(chuckles) This is going on. They do not understand that this world is meant for suffering. We have discussed little in that topic with Śyāmasundara. Just like they invented the communistic idea. Does it mean the communists are not suffering? They are suffering more. They have no liberty. They have lost their liberty, the whole people. They are so much pressed by the government that there is no liberty at all. The younger generation, they cannot go out, so much suffering. I may live even in a big house, but if you say, ""You cannot go out. Then you'll be punished,"" that idea will be suffering—""Oh, I cannot go out."""
Brahmānanda,"We have one devotee. He escaped from Communist Hungary, and he was telling me all the story, how on the borders how much they keep the people from trying to escape. Even in Berlin, in Germany...",Prabhupāda,They shoot.
Brahmānanda,"They have a system, automatic shooting, that if you cross a certain line, they have these rays of light, and if you break the ray of light, then automatically all machine guns start firing in the whole area. It's all done...",Prabhupāda,This is their scientific advancement.
Brahmānanda,They've made such a nice place that they're afraid the people will escape from it.,Prabhupāda,"And they are thinking, ""This system is for happiness."""
Brahmānanda,"If it's for happiness, then why prevent people from leaving?",Prabhupāda,"""Why?""—that you are asking. They think it is happiness. That is calledmāyā.It is not happiness; still, if somebody is thinking happiness, that is calledmāyā."
Dhanañjaya,"But even if they cross the line successfully, they'll only suffer misery on the other side too.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Dhanañjaya,They'll only suffer another kind of misery.,Prabhupāda,Hm. Yes.
Brahmānanda,"Some boys, they escaped from one country, I think Rumania. And they came to our temple. They had heard about our movement, so they came to our temple. They stayed for a little while, but then they were wanting to leave. So they left, and immediately they were apprehended by the authorities in... I think it was in Sweden. And now they are put into camps, they cannot leave, they have to be processed, and practically they are again in jail. They have no freedom. They cannot get a job. They have no passport. It will take them years to get all the papers in order. They have to be investigated to see that they are not spies. So again they are still in the miserable condition.",Prabhupāda,"So miserable condition... That is our conclusion, that either you remain this side or that side, it is miserable. By mental concoction you think that ""This is better than that."" ThereforeKṛṣṇasays frankly,sarva-dharmānparityajya[Bg.18.66].That is only shelter.Māmupetyakaunteyaduḥkhālayamaśāśvatamnāpnuvanti[Bg.8.15].[break] ...take Kṛṣṇa's words as it is. Everything is there. He said, ""This material world isduḥkhālayam;it is the place of suffering."" Industrialist, businessman, anyone, even ordinary man, actually everyone is suffering, but everyone is thinking, ""I am happy."" [break]"
Brahmānanda,"...because there is some sex pleasure, that makes it tolerable.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is the, what is called, topmost ignorance, topmost ignorance, that ""This is happiness."" So the materialistic person means only for that happiness they are suffering so much, this way. They agree, ""Yes."" Just like Dr., er, BonMahārājawas speaking that they are talking freely?"
Brahmānanda,"Oh, about homosexuality.",Prabhupāda,"""Oh, yes. What is the wrong? It is pleasure."" They take it as pleasure."
Brahmānanda,"The priests. They're in the theological seminary, and they are priests, and they are saying that ""It is pleasurable, so why not do it?""",Prabhupāda,"And what is the pleasure? Stool-passing and urine-passing points are joined together, and it is pleasure. Just see their standard of pleasure. Just like the pigs. With pleasure, they eat stool. So they think it is pleasure. Standard of pleasure has gone down so low. This isKali-yuga. [break] ...advanced. He has disciple,guru, but he knows that he is suffering whole life for this institution. Still he'll not give it up."
Brahmānanda,He still has hope against hope.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He thinks that ""I shall die peacefully if I expand the laboratory house, that I have given something toVṛndāvana."" Did he not say like that?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,As ifCaitanyaMahāprabhuasked him to give this institution toVṛndāvana. Such a foolish person.
Brahmānanda,"Yet he also admits that any boys who have intelligence, who are good students, they will go toMathurāandAgraand other places for education. Here only the village boys come.",Prabhupāda,(to passerby:)HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.
Brahmānanda,Therefore he has very few students. He has very few students.,Prabhupāda,Yes. [break]
Brahmānanda,Now he is wearingkuntībeads.,Prabhupāda,Oh. Because he was criticized by our students in U.S.A. (sound of bell) See? The bell is ringing nice. There was no such ringing in this quarter. [break] ...fixed up so that thieves may not take it away? Not so securely.
Dhanañjaya,"Well, they have... I'll make sure it is done today.",Prabhupāda,"Oh. When I say? That means no brain. I am asking without seeing, and you are seeing for the last one week. You do not know it, that what is secure, what is not secure. That is the defect. Here thieves are very expert."
Dhanañjaya,"But thechokidaris there at the front, guarding all night, and the bell is situated very high inside the dome.",Prabhupāda,Still should be secure. [break] ...that in the temple these bells are stolen even it is secure. Therefore we shall be very careful.
Dhanañjaya,"But there are always devotees, twenty-four hours.",Prabhupāda,"(to passerby:)Jaya.HareKṛṣṇa. But our devotees, the first-class devotee, (chuckles) he is not very intelligent. He does not know what is secure, what is not secure. [break] ...character that we are not very much concerned, but we have to live in a world which is very, very cunning. It is not yet half past six.HareKṛṣṇa. (end) As soon as you make ""Hindu religion,"" ""Muslim religion,"" ""Christian religion,"" immediately it is not religion, immediately. BecauseKṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajya[Bg.18.66].Why does He say,sarva-dharmānparityajya?(Aside:)HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.Because that is not religion. The so-called religions which are going on, they are not religion. That we do not say at the present moment because you are not so strong. But we have to say that. There is no religion. All cheating. WhyKṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajya[Bg.18.66]?Why?"
Akṣayānanda:,Akṣayānanda:Because there is no other religion.,Prabhupāda,Yes. There is no religion.
Akṣayānanda:,"Akṣayānanda:That is actual religion, surrendering toKṛṣṇa. Everything else is cheating.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Cheating others, cheating himself. Just like this animal sacrifice. The man who is sacrificing, he is cheating himself, and he is cheating others also. [break] ...cheating, envious. Just like a man who is killing another man. So he is envious to himself as well as the man whom he is killing. Both. I am killing somebody, he is being killed. I am envious. And I forget that I'll be killed. Then I am envious to me also."
Brahmānanda,Yeah. Even one's own self-interest he is not taking care of.,Prabhupāda,"This is the position. Even it is forbidden... In the Christian religion it is forbidden: ""Thou shall not kill."" And they are killing. That means envious of the animal, and he is envious of himself also. They are now being killed in the womb of the mother. Why the child is now being killed within the womb of the mother? Hm?"
Akṣayānanda:,Akṣayānanda:Because they are envious. They are envious.,Prabhupāda,SoUpendrahas not come?
Brahmānanda,No.,Prabhupāda,Why?
Brahmānanda,He said he had to take a laxative last night.,Prabhupāda,"Some way or other, he avoids. Eh? [break] ...therefore forbidden to make one steady inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So if one does not follow this thing, then his mind, he cannot control. It is not possible. Unless one can control the mind and the senses, he cannot be steady. That ismāyā'strick, to become guided by the mind. That ismāyā'strick. [break]"
Trivikrama,...sixteen rounds.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So let him go to hell. What can be done? [break] So his friend said, ""Oh, you are drinking. You will go to hell."" ""Oh, my father is drinking."" ""Oh, he will go to hell."" ""My mother is also drinking."" ""Oh, she will go."" Then brother, sister... ""Then where is hell? We are going all there. If we can live together, where is hell? Let us go to hell. Doesn't matter."" So your argument is that. ""Because everyone is being cheated, then where is fault? I have been cheated. That's all. It is not hell. It is heaven."" (laughter)HareKṛṣṇa."
Akṣayānanda:,Akṣayānanda:It's like saying everything is one.,Prabhupāda,No. That cannot be. You are one cheated and he is one cheater. How they can be one? (laughter)
Dhanañjaya,[break] ...isn't self-sufficiency...,Prabhupāda,"Self-suff... There is no self-sufficiency. Self-insufficiency. Always remember that. Unless you become perfect inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, there is no self-sufficiency. All self-insufficiency.HareKṛṣṇa. [break] So you give me a description, what he is doing. [break] ...thinking, ""I am independent,"" but he is kicked by his mind every moment. This is his independence—""Go there. Come here. Do this. Do that."" The mind is dictating, and he is thinking, ""I am independent."" This is the position of conditioned soul. Therefore he is called conditioned. He is conditioned by the mind, and he is thinking ""independent.""Mūḍha.Thereforemūḍha.Tri-guṇamayairbhāvaiḥmohitaḥ.He is illusioned by the three modes of material nature, and he does not knowKṛṣṇa, and he is thinking ""independent."""
Trivikrama,The mind is cheating us.,Prabhupāda,"Certainly he'll cheat. If you cannot control, it will cheat. Mind is the friend, and mind is the enemy. If you becomeKṛṣṇaconscious fully, then mind is friend. And if you do not becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, mind is enemy.māyāis also. If you becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, then she is Rādhārāṇī. And if he is notKṛṣṇaconscious, she isDurga."
Dhanañjaya,So all these cheaters aremāyā'sagents.,Prabhupāda,"No, no, they are agent ofKṛṣṇa. (to passerby:)HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.But because you want to cheatKṛṣṇa, therefore they are cheating you. They are not your servant.Mamamāyā:""My servant."" Just like the police. Police is punishing you not on their own account. Because you are disobedient, you must be punished.Daivīhyeṣāguṇamayī[Bg.7.14]."
Brahmānanda,"The moment we stop cheatingKṛṣṇa, then we can...",Prabhupāda,"Then, immediately, he becomes friend. This is the way, going on. The whole arrangement is like that. So long we shall not surrender toKṛṣṇa, we have to suffer so many ways, different species of life, different condition, different planets. This is going on. [break] ...indirectly forcing that ""You beKṛṣṇaconscious. Otherwise you'll be punished."" Why police is so unkind? Because the indirect way is that ""You become lawful; otherwise you'll continue to be suffering by us."" So intelligent person thinks of it, and he becomesKṛṣṇaconscious. And those who are rascals, fools, bewildered, they think, ""We shall adjust it by manufacturing every year new type of motorcars."" Although there is accident... The increase of motorcar means increasing the death rate of public.Huh? And still they'll do that. It is becoming problem in cities in Europe and America. All roads and streets are always congested. They cannot drive even at ten miles speed. Still, they are increasing. Still, they are increasing motorcar."
Brahmānanda,They are passing laws now that you're not allowed to drive your car in the center of the cities.,Prabhupāda,Just see. They are keeping two miles away the car and coming to the office.
Guṇārṇava,"And they pack all the cars on top of the roofs of the buildings, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Brahmānanda,"Yeah. They have a board with numbers, and each time a car is produced, it is put on the board. And it's a big board displayed in the city. (end)",Prabhupāda,"...get money, they will spend it for spoiling himself."
Nayanābhirāma:,Nayanābhirāma:So I was just wondering if it wouldn't be better if we gave them food and clothing instead of paying them.,Prabhupāda,"But they will not work. [break] ...gradually.HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.[break] ...Who does not deviate from the instruction of the Lord, he is Aryan. All others, non-Aryan. The Aryans will take the words of God as it is, without any deviation. That is Aryan. An Aryan means advanced, advanced in knowledge, and one who is advanced in knowledge, he is advanced civilized. Rascal fools, how they can be civilized? Everyone is claiming ""Aryan,"" but he does not know what is the business of Aryans. Simply by some bodily feature... The same ignorance—""I am this body."" So by the bodily features they settle up: ""This is from Aryan family; this is from non-Aryan family."" That is good. That is external. Real Aryan means one who is advanced in knowledge and goes by the order ofKṛṣṇa, or God. (aside:)Jaya."
Brahmānanda,"Adolf Hitler adopted the idea of Aryan, but his criteria for Aryan was one who had blond hair and blue eyes.",Prabhupāda,"That is bodily. (chuckles) That is another foolishness. Just like we have dress. So this dress ofsannyāsīis not all. I must be realsannyāsīin knowledge, in education, in behavior, not that... Hitler studies by the dress. That is the foolishness. It is not by the dress, but by the quality. Dress is also required. As I amsannyāsī,I cannot dress otherwise. That is also essential. But if one judges, ""Here is asannyāsī,"" then he'll misled. That is being done. People are being exploited in the dress of asannyāsī,although actually he is notsannyāsa.That is also stated in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.""Asannyāsīor abrāhmaṇawill be accepted by the outward feature."" If somebody has got a thread only, twopaisaworth, he becomes abrāhmaṇa.And when one takes adaṇḍa,he becomes asannyāsī.This will be the identification in theKali-yuga."
Brahmānanda,So the Ramakrishna philosophy...,Prabhupāda,Ramakrishna philosophy is nonsense.
Brahmānanda,I know. (laughter) They say it doesn't matter what kind of dress you wear.,Prabhupāda,"But ""They say..."" They are rascals. They can say anything.Chagalekinakhayapagālekinabale:""A madman, what does he not say, and a goat, what does he not eat?"" (laughter)"
Brahmānanda,That's their philosophy.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. We have to take philosophy from theācāryas. Ācāryopāsanam.They are notācāryas,neither they follow theācāryas.They do not follow anyācāryas,either Śaṅkarācārya or Madhvācārya or Rāmānujācārya. They have their own philosophy.Ācārya,the Ramakrishna, he used to worship GoddessKali, but even they do not do that. Eh?"
Brahmānanda,No. They don't even have deity worship even to GoddessKali. They are so advanced...,Prabhupāda,Yes. So where they stand? They have no platform.
Guṇārṇava,"What do they do, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,I do not know.
Guṇārṇava,"Oh, yes. I went to that, one candle, once. They were just playing...",Prabhupāda,"Then why they have established Ramakrishna'smūrti?If they worship candle, then why they install Ramakrishna? That is the flaw. They have no standard of knowledge."
Guṇārṇava,"ĀnandaPrabhuwas mentioning that he was speaking to one of thesannyāsīsof the Ramakrishna mission, and they were very concerned because a lot of their disciples were leaving the mission and joining our society. They were very concerned. Their society is not at all expanding.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That was begun long ago. For their hospital, formerly... (bell ringing)"
Viśāla,Viśāla(in distance):All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!,Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇa. Retired medical practitioners, they used to join. (aside:)HareKṛṣṇa. But nobody is joining now. What is this?"
Viśāla,Tadviddhipraṇipātena...[Bg.4.34]. (etc.) (end),Prabhupāda,"Brahmācarya. Brahmācaryameans completely cessation from sex life. This isbrahmācarya.Tapasyabegins, austerity. This is the greatest austerity, to cease sex.Tapasabrahmācarya.Our Vedic civilization, the boys are trained how to becomebrahmacārīfrom the very beginning of life."
Indian:,Indian:(Hindi),Prabhupāda,"Ha. [break] ...putrakāyenaśuddhyetsattva.Our existentional position should be purified. How?Tapo,bytapasya.Tapodivyaṁputrakāyenaśuddhyetsattva[SB5.5.1].""And we are enjoying life. Why we should undergotapasya?"" And you are enjoying, but you are not enjoying; you are suffering. Even if you think you are enjoying, there are so many sufferings. That the foolish people, they do not know. Just like a healthy man, he thinks, ""I am enjoying,"" but he does not see that even he is now healthy, he will be an old man, he will be attacked with disease, he will die, and still he thinks, ""I am healthy.""Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam[Bg.13.9].Therefore the intelligent man will see that ""Where is my enjoyment if I am going to die? I don't want to die, but I am going to die."" That is sure, as sure as anything. And still the rascal will think that ""I am happy."" He will become old man, he will be attacked with disease, and still he is thinking that he is happy. Apart from this, there are so many other sufferings, but he thinks that he is happy. And that happiness is centered around sex. That's all.Yanmaithunadi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁhituccham[SB7.9.45].Their only happiness is sex. Therefore in the Western countries they are simply trying to increase the sex enjoyment. That's all. Is it not?"
Devotees:,Devotees:Yes.,Prabhupāda,The whole civilization is based on how to enjoy sex very nicely. This is their basic principle of civilization.
Brahmānanda,Always on the best-seller charts of the books there is always some book about how to enjoy sex.,Prabhupāda,"Just see. There are books here also,Kāma-śāstra.So sex enjoyment also you cannot enjoy unlimitedly. Then you will become impotent. Then you will have to call your wife as ""mother,"" as some saintly person did. He was indulging in sex in his young age, and when he was married he saw himself impotent, and therefore he invented some way that ""I have realizedBrahman. I can call my wife also 'mother.' "" And he became famous—""Oh, he is so advanced. He has learned how to..."" But in the history we will not find this. Even Vyāsadeva had his wife, but he never said his wife, ""mother."""
Brahmānanda,Actually you're supposed to see other women as mother.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,But not one's own wife.,Prabhupāda,"No.Para-dāreṣu. Mātravatpara-dareṣu.That is the injunction of theśās...Other's wife. Not that ""Oh, my wife is also my mother."" Just see. This lunacy is going on, and this lunatic man is taken as incarnation of God. This is going on. This homosex propaganda is another side of impotency. So that is natural. If you enjoy too much, then you become impotent."
Brahmānanda,"They are trying to make that more and more accepted in America, homosex.",Prabhupāda,Yes. The churches accept. It is already law.
Nitāi,"This women's liberation movement, the leaders are also homosexual. They're lesbians.",Prabhupāda,(laughs) Just see.HareKṛṣṇa. The whole world is on the verge of ruination.Kali-yuga.[break]
Brahmānanda,"...become ruined. The world is on the verge of ruination, but it doesn't become ruined; so therefore they think, ""Oh, it doesn't matter. We can go on.""",Prabhupāda,They do not know what is the meaning of ruination. [break] ...so many problems. Still it is not on the verge of ruination?
Brahmānanda,It's on the verge.,Prabhupāda,That's all right. But why you are very much disturbed with so many problems?
Dhanañjaya,They always take the brighter side.,Prabhupāda,"No. They are discussing, ""There will be no more petrol. There will be no more this, no more that."""
Brahmānanda,"So they are thinking, ""Well, then we'll get the sun power. Then we'll get this and we'll get that.""",Prabhupāda,"Well, that is the problem. It is not that ""Theoretically here is a problem. I will solve it like this. I'll..."" That is not solution of problem. Problem is there. When you actually make solution, then... This is madness, theorizing, ""We shall solve the problem like this."" They are wasting public money in so many ways. [break] They do not know what is real problem. The real problem is presented byKṛṣṇa:janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi[Bg.13.9].That they do not care, although they do not want it. That's a fact. It is a problem because they do not want it. But they do not take it as serious problem. This is foolishness."
Brahmānanda,"President Ford, he was almost killed.",Prabhupāda,Ācchā?What about?
Brahmānanda,"Some woman... He was mingling in the crowd for the election, and some woman came up to him. She was two feet away from him, and she took out of her purse a loaded pistol, and she was to go like this, and then she was...",Prabhupāda,Captured.
Nayanābhirāma:,Nayanābhirāma:He was going to shake her hand.,Prabhupāda,Just see.
Brahmānanda,"So the president said, ""Oh, this is simply a distraction."" He was trying to say it wasn't important.",Prabhupāda,What was the cause?
Brahmānanda,"She is a member of a group, a fanatical group in California. I don't know what... The Manson group? Charles Manson? Who is that group? This man killed about six people.",Prabhupāda,Prominent.
Brahmānanda,And I think this man has many wives. He has about two dozen wives. These are all his wives. He's in jail now. Life sentence. [break],Prabhupāda,There is no problem.
Brahmānanda,"Yes. He was saying, ""Oh, it's just a distraction."" [break]",Prabhupāda,"...the President's life is not safe, and there is no problem. What to speak of others."
Dhanañjaya,An intelligent man will go completely insane because he can't solve the problems...,Prabhupāda,The solution is there.
Dhanañjaya,...without referring to the Vedic philosophy.,Prabhupāda,The solution is there. Take it. TakeKṛṣṇaconsciousness.
Dhanañjaya,They're so much implicated by sex life.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Gradually they'll become ... understand that this is not good. Thereforegṛhasthaāśramais allowed under rules and regulation. The purpose is to restrict sex life.
Brahmānanda,"The wife of the President, she recently said that sex life before marriage is good because it will reduce the divorce rate.",Prabhupāda,Yes. If everyone is prostitute then where is the question of divorce? (laughter)
Nitāi,There's also no question of marriage.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And that is going on. (end) (Hindi) Do you know this? [break] ...go somewhere, better go, at least four men; and when you read some knowledge, at least two men; but when you eat, one man. Don't bring four men and two men. Then he will be hungry; you will be hungry. (laughter) So for advancement of knowledge, two men at least required, discussion—not that I am reading and sleeping also."

""The law is that I must give to my son, not toKṛṣṇa."""
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Our devotees are saying that?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. (Hindi) ""You just see my face, beautiful face. And whatever I had, that I have left with my sons and wife."" Mostly they come..."

So they became angry.Vṛndāvanais not for sense gratification. NarottamadāsaṬhākura therefore says,"
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Prabhupāda? You mention in your book that recently they have begun some demigod worship inVṛndāvana.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Not recently. Since very long time. Thesegosvāmīs.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Castegosvāmīs.But originally this was not the fact.,Prabhupāda,"Originally there wasRūpaGosvāmī.

Gopāla,"GopālaKṛṣṇa:If we don't work hard they say, ""You are a burden on society.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Gopāla,"GopālaKṛṣṇa:If a person doesn't work hard day and night they say, ""You are just living on society.""",Prabhupāda,That I am explaining. The day and night is that pig is working. That I am explaining. Then what is the difference between the pig and me if I am also working hard like that pig?Huh?
Gopāla,GopālaKṛṣṇa:There's no difference.,Prabhupāda,"Then why you say you are advanced civilization? That is forbidden.Kaṣṭankāmānnaarhati.It is not desirable; it is not good. You are given this body different from this pig because you will live peacefully and happily. Why should you acceptkaṣṭankāman,so hardship? Actually they do not want to work hard. Otherwise why the proprietor, the capitalist, they leave the factory and go to a solitary place? Why does he go?"
Gopāla,GopālaKṛṣṇa:They don't find any happiness even in the hard work.,Prabhupāda,"The other worker, he is seeing that ""This rascal has engaged us in hard work and he is enjoying. So drive him out. Kill him."" This is communism. Everyone wants that, comfort, peacefully living. Therefore this civilization, to work hard, is condemned. If hard work is desirable why the capitalists avoiding? Hm? What is answer?"
Upendra,They say they worked hard to get there.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Upendra,They worked hard to get there.,Prabhupāda,"""To get there"" means?"
Upendra,To get to their position they worked hard.,Prabhupāda,What is their position?
Upendra,Of relaxation.,Prabhupāda,Relaxing. I am relaxing. Why you are inducing me? I am relaxing. Then why you are inducing me to work hard? I am already relaxing. ChantHareKṛṣṇaand take littleprasāda.That's all. Why you are inducing me to work hard?
Brahmānanda,They say you have to earn your relaxation.,Prabhupāda,"But earn or not earn, I am enjoying relaxation."
Brahmānanda,You're not entitled unless you work very hard.,Prabhupāda,Oh. That is nonsense.
Upendra,In America they say you have to pay for freedom.,Prabhupāda,"No, freedom, if I have got already, why shall I pay? I have already paid. Why you're inducing? I am already enjoying. Why you are inducing me to work hard? I have paid for it. By mykarmain my previous life I have already paid for that; therefore I am enjoying."
Gopāla,GopālaKṛṣṇa:They don't believe in the law ofkarma.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore they are rascals. Rascal. This is a rascal civilization. Rascal civilization: one side, they say contraceptive; another side, they will encourage woman to marry three times a week. This is their civilization. If you want stop population why you are inducing ""Indulge in sex life""? Stop sex life—brahmacārī.Everything is contradictory. And it is all sense gratification, based on sense gratification."
Gopāla,GopālaKṛṣṇa:If a person is not satisfying his senses they think he is crazy.,Prabhupāda,"But where is your sense satisfied? You are crazy.

Brahmānanda,"""Misery loves company.""",Prabhupāda,What is that?
Brahmānanda,"That's a saying, that if someone is feeling misery, he wants other people to also enjoy the misery.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,No one wants to suffer alone.,Prabhupāda,"Cutting the tail of the jackal. (Bengali) ""My tail is cut, so your tail must be cut."" This is a fashion. (pause) That is practical. The world is working so hard but where is the peace and happiness?"
Brahmānanda,It's coming.,Prabhupāda,(laughs) When it will come? That is unknown.
Brahmānanda,Maybe at the end of this century.,Prabhupāda,"And at the end of your life. Just like insurance policy. You'll be happy after death. ""You go on paying now, work hard, go on paying the premium and you'll be happy after death."" This is insurance policy. And I am going to be a dog after death, and how he'll be happy? Just see."
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):It is evident that miseries are growing darker and darker.,Prabhupāda,"That must be because you are under nature's law. How you can avoid? As you are working, you will get the result.Karmanadaiva-netrena[SB3.31.1].There is superior power to supervise how you are working."

But the difference is you forget; I don't forget. That is difference between you and Me. You also don't forget. That is for limited time. But the consciousness is the same. Only difference is that My consciousness is unlimited; your consciousness is limited. That is difference."" This understanding isahaṁbrahmāsmi.My consciousness and Kṛṣṇa's consciousness, that is fact. But Kṛṣṇa's consciousness is everywhere; my consciousness is within myself. That's all. TheMāyāvādīinterprets,yenasarvamidaṁtataḥ:""One who is expanded everywhere, pervaded."" But I am not pervading everywhere."
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,"Dhṛṣṭaketu:They say when you become liberated then you become..., then you pervade everywhere. It's just that... They say that just now, in this position...",Prabhupāda,So when you will be liberated? What is the standard of liberation?
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,"Dhṛṣṭaketu:By performing austerities, by studying the...",Prabhupāda,That's all right. What is the standard?
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,"Dhṛṣṭaketu:When I merge, when I lose my identity, when I don't...",Prabhupāda,"That means you forget. You forget everything. Then how you will be liberated? Whatever little consciousness was there, that is finished. Then how you become liberated? Whatever you had, that is also finished. Eh? Then how you become liberated?"
Harikeśa,But what we are forgetting is just illusion anyway.,Prabhupāda,"That is liberation. Then I kill you, you forget everything—liberation. (laughter) What is the meaning of liberation? They do not know even the meaning of liberation."
Harikeśa,To get rid of all these miseries.,Prabhupāda,That you can do. I can kill you; you get rid of all miseries. Finished. You are finished; your miseries are finished. That's all.
Brahmānanda,It doesn't matter whether you live or you die because it is all one.,Prabhupāda,"Well, let me kill you. That's all right. It will be great beneficial to you."
Indian man (1):,"Indian man (1):To my opinion, we are more liberated in... (indistinct).",Prabhupāda,"Your opinion, my opinion. We have to consider the fact. (Vraja-vasipasses by, singing) This isjīvankosabadiyatomara.This is surrender, that he is singing,jīvankosabadiya:""When I surrender unto Your lotus feet."" That is surrender. This is liberation. Just like the child fully surrendered to the parent, he is liberated. He has no anxiety. He is confident ""My parents are there. Whatever he'll do, that's all right for me."" That is liberation."
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):We can become free from all anxieties.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is liberation. If you are filled up with anxieties where is your liberation? That is not liberation."
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:They will also say that this condition of being one with the Supreme is also...,Prabhupāda,"How you become one? IfKṛṣṇaor the consciousness is there but you lose your consciousness, why you become one?"
Harikeśa,"Well, it's not exactly that we lose consciousness but we merge into the supreme consciousness.",Prabhupāda,Supreme consciousness?
Harikeśa,Then we become God.,Prabhupāda,No. You cannot. Then why you are different now?
Harikeśa,It's mylīlā.(laughter),Prabhupāda,"Then if it islīlā,then why you are undergoing austerity? That is alsolīlā.If it islīlā,then why you are trying to get out of it by practicing austerity?"
Harikeśa,MahārājaṚṣabhadeva performed austerity.,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Harikeśa,"Ṛṣabhadeva, he performed austerity.",Prabhupāda,"No, what...? I do not follow what you say."
Brahmānanda,"He's saying that Ṛṣabhadeva performed austerity, so therefore I am performing austerity.",Prabhupāda,You are performing but what is Ṛṣabhadeva's position?
Dhanañjaya,But the whole thing is that the supreme consciousness is unembodied and we are embodied right now. So when we attain supreme consciousness we also become unembodied.,Prabhupāda,"How you become embodied if you are supreme? Who made you embodied if you are supreme? Then who made you embodied, he is supreme. You are not supreme. You did not like to be embodied; therefore you are trying to be bodyless. But who made you embodied? Then that he or she is supreme. You are not supreme."
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:I put myself in this condition so that I can enjoy getting out of it.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:I put myself in this condition of illusion so that I can enjoy being liberated.,Prabhupāda,And so you put yourself to be kicked by me and enjoy. Just test what is the enjoyment of being kicked.
Dhanañjaya,But without pain how can you experience pleasure?,Prabhupāda,"You get this experience, how it is pleasure? I kick and you enjoy?"
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:The idea is that after experiencing the suffering of this material world then liberation will be very...,Prabhupāda,"Why there is suffering, material? You are supreme; why it is suffering for you?"
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,"Dhṛṣṭaketu:Well, so that when I...",Prabhupāda,"So, there is no ""so that."" Why you are suffering?"
Brahmānanda,It's suffering only for those...,Prabhupāda,"If it is yourlīlā,then you are suffering. What is this nonsense of ""mylīlā."" Suffering?"
Brahmānanda,"The suffering is only for those who haven't..., who don't understand that they are supreme.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Brahmānanda,"Those who don't understand, they are the ones who suffer, but I don't suffer.",Prabhupāda,"So it is better to remain in that ignorance. Just like the hogs and dogs, they do not understand that this is suffering. But we can understand that this is suffering."
Brahmānanda,"Yes. To be a dog, that's all right because the dog doesn't suffer. He is enjoying.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, why you are doing austerity? Remain as dog and cat. Therefore you aremūḍha.You do not know what is suffering, what is enjoyment.Mūḍho nābhijānātimamebhyaḥparamavyayam.Therefore one who is intelligent,jñāni,bahūnāmjan...After suffering in this way and talking all nonsense, when he comes to the real knowledge, then he surrenders.Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmaṁprapadyate[Bg.7.19].That is knowledge."
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):Kamādinaṁ katīnakatidhapalitadurnideśaḥ.,Prabhupāda,"Ah. When he comes to this awareness, that ""I have simply suffered and I wanted to maintain myself by jugglery of words,"" then he comes to the real knowledge."
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:So the Māyāvādīs' philosophy is actually the supreme illusion.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. ThereforeCaitanyaMahāprabhuhas forbidden.Māyāvādī-bhāṣyasunilehayasarvanasa[Cc.Madhya6.169].One is finished if he follows theMāyāvādaphilosophy. He is doomed. He will never be able to accept the real philosophy. He will be absorbed in that false philosophy. This is Māyāvādī's position.Māyāvādīhayakṛṣṇeaparādhī.They areaparādhī,offender. Therefore they shall remain perpetually in ignorance and think himself, ""I am God."" This is Māyāvādī's position. Vivekānanda preached openly that ""Why you are thinking that you are sinful? You are God."" He preached like that."
Brahmānanda,"The Christians, they have a concept of sin. So when Vivekānanda went to America he was telling them, ""No, you forget this concept. Whatever you do, it's all right because you are God."" They were surprised.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Gopāla,GopālaKṛṣṇa:That's why they liked him.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. They did not like. The Christian priests did not like him. They condemned him, ""Oh, you are come from India, and you are speaking nonsense, this?"" In those hundred years the Christian priests were conscious: ""But how is this? From India he has come and he's talking like nonsense?"" They questioned in Chicago speech."
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:He's just fanning the fires of atheism.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Harikeśa,"ThisMāyāvādīphilosophy, is this...?",Prabhupāda,"They are atheist. They are first-class atheist, more than the Buddhist.Vedanamaniyabauddhahailanāstika.The Buddhists, they did not accept Vedic authorities; therefore they are considered asnāstika.Butvedāśrayanāstikyavada.These rascals, they acceptVedasand preaches atheism. So they are more dangerous than the Buddhists. This isCaitanyaMahāprabhu's version. (aside)HareKṛṣṇa.Bauddhakeadhika:""They are more dangerous than the Buddhists."" The Buddhists, although they are supposed to be atheists, they worship the Deity LordBuddha. But they say it ismāyā.And more advanced than these atheists."
Brahmānanda,The Māyāvādīs.,Prabhupāda,"More... Not advanced. More degraded. These atheists, they have been taught to worship the form of LordBuddha, andBuddhais incarnation ofKṛṣṇa, so one day they will be delivered. But these rascals will never be delivered."
Pṛthu,Pṛthu-putra:I read in one of your books so many names about different groups of theseMāyāvādīphilosophers. Are they still existing today and active?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Anyone who thinks godlessness, he isMāyāvādī, that's all. Anyone. All these impersonalists, they are all Māyāvādīs. And mostly they are now impersonalists."
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,"Dhṛṣṭaketu:So although we can't see it with our material eyes, their position is very precarious.",Prabhupāda,"We have no eyes to see. We see throughKṛṣṇa. AsKṛṣṇasees, we see. This isKṛṣṇaconscious. We are not perfect. Our position is that we are not perfect. But we are perfect so long we followKṛṣṇa, that's all. Just like I am blind man. I am not perfect. But if you have got eyes, if you take me I follow you. Then I am perfect.Kṛṣṇaassures that ""You surrender to Me and I will make you free from all dangers,"" and we acceptKṛṣṇa. That's all. Our method is very easy. The child is walking, unable to walk, falling down. The parents say, father says, ""My dear child, just catch my hand."" Then he's safe. These Māyāvādīs, they go against the verdict of God. God says that ""The living entities are My part and parcel,"" and they say, ""I am God."" So that is their foolishness. Part and parcel...Kṛṣṇasays,mamaivaṁsojīva-bhutaḥ[Bg.15.7].Otherwise why God says, ""Surrender unto Me,"" if you are equal with Him? Why God is asking, ""Surrender unto Me""? You are not equal. You are rascal. You are claiming that ""I am equal."" Otherwise there is no question of surrender. ""You surrender unto Me."" And this knowledge of surrender comes,Kṛṣṇasays,bahūnāṁjanmanām:""This rascal is always thinking 'I am God, God, God.' This rascaldom is finished after many, many births, this ignorance."" Then he surrenders. How the living entity is equal with God?"
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,"Dhṛṣṭaketu:Of course, they may say that ""Kṛṣṇa is just an ordinary man like me and therefore He is asking...""",Prabhupāda,"Therefore you are rascal.Kṛṣṇais ordinary man, and He is lifting the hill."
Brahmānanda,"Well, that's just a story in a book.",Prabhupāda,"He may be story for you. You may not believe that you have got a father but we are notmad. You can say, ""To have a father is a story,"" but mother says, ""No, you have your father."" She is authority. You can say, ""Oh, it is story."""
Brahmānanda,"Yes, why doesn'tKṛṣṇacome and do it now?",Prabhupāda,"He is not your father's servant, that he will come by your order. He's the supreme master.Kṛṣṇais doing the same thing still, but you have no eyes to see.Kṛṣṇais doing. How thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is spreading all over the world?"
Brahmānanda,Why doesn't God force me to surrender?,Prabhupāda,"No. ThatKṛṣṇais not a nonsense like you. BecauseKṛṣṇahas given you little freedom He does not want to touch it. That isKṛṣṇa. What He gives, He never takes it back. It is not a nonsensical award that ""I give you sometimes; then I take it away.""Kṛṣṇadoes not do such. He has given you little freedom, so you can use it.Yathecchasitathākuru[Bg.18.63],Kṛṣṇasays in theBhagavad...,""Whatever you like, you do."" That freedom is taken by nature. You are human being. If you do not engage yourself inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then nature will withdraw this privilege and you'll become a dog.Kṛṣṇadoes not take, but His agent,māyā,will take it away. Just like the police is the agent of the king or the government. The government does not care what you are doing. But if you do something criminal the police will punish you."
Brahmānanda,But we're going to change the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda,"That is another foolishness. (laughter) That is also replied,daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyādura...[Bg.7.14]. ""You cannot do that, my dear sir. You rascal, you are thinking like that. That is not possible."""
Gopāla,GopālaKṛṣṇa:But they say they've already made so much progress.,Prabhupāda,"You go on making progress but you will never come to the ultimate goal. You can go on foolishly. That's all right. Just like they made progress, United Nations. What progress they have made?"
Harikeśa,They made a nice building.,Prabhupāda,That's right. (laughs) There are so many buildings.
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):But they've been going to be assassinated.,Prabhupāda,"When I go that building, United Nations, I see how they are wasting money. Yes, I see."
Gopāla,"GopālaKṛṣṇa:They have a very big budget, United Nations, billions of...",Prabhupāda,"Big, big. So many publications, so many big..."
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):They make everybody un-united.,Prabhupāda,Huh? Yes. Disunited.
Pṛthu,Pṛthu-putra:You have written in one of your books that they are just becoming more flags instead of less.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. They are increasing flags. Instead of one flag, they increasing flags. And they are trying for the last how many years? Thirty years?"
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,"Dhṛṣṭaketu:But ifKṛṣṇais the Supreme and I should surrender unto Him, then why is it so hard to find out this knowledge? Why is it that only in the human form of life... Why is it so difficult to come to this knowledge if...",Prabhupāda,"Because you are rascal. For rascal everything is difficult. Easy thing is made difficult by rascals. That is the proof that you are rascal. By nature one is supposed to surrender to the parents. This is easy. Why do you do not do this? This is natural. Just like you have surrendered to me. Why? Because you think I am superior, you have to take knowledge from me. So if you have to accept some superior for your guidance, how you can deny surrendering? You see,brahmacārī,he is being taughtdaṇḍavatśīraṣi,by touching the head. Yesterday we were talking of thatbrahmacārī?That is the instruction. Who is this boy?"
Harikeśa,He'sKuṇḍali. He just came from New York.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Gopāla,GopālaKṛṣṇa:He just came from New York. He's from the West... He's a Commonwealth citizen. He's from the West Indies. He says he'll stay in India for the rest of his life.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, that's nice. So you are going to the magistrate? You have calculated?"
Saurabha,Ten thousand bags.,Prabhupāda,"Ten thousand bags. No, I wanted to construct this building with bricks."
Saurabha,"Yes, but we have to make some slabs and some...",Prabhupāda,Slabs? So still you will require ten thousand?
Saurabha,"No. If we do with mud, then it will be much less.",Prabhupāda,Not mud. The mortar means sand and cement.
Guṇārṇava,No plaster?,Prabhupāda,"No, no, plastering also."
Saurabha,No plastering.,Prabhupāda,"No, plastering also."
Saurabha,"But it comes to about eight thousand bags if I do the whole land like that around. That is the full thing, two stories. It comes to about eight thousand. And then there's always some extra for finalizing the floors...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. I don't want to use this iron."
Saurabha,"No, we don't require iron.",Prabhupāda,Simply brick. So in that way you still require ten thousand?
Saurabha,"We require about eight thousand but it's best to apply for ten thousand. If we only need five thousand, we take that. They will give us that allotment.",Prabhupāda,Do it. [break]
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:WhenKṛṣṇawould play His flute then the airplanes would be there.,Prabhupāda,Eh?

Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:InVṛndāvana?,Prabhupāda,Oh. Then why the airplanes do not come Delhi? (laughter) (pause) He is godless and we have to fight against them. Just see our position. We have to fight with the whole world.

Brahmānanda,That is their ignorance.,Prabhupāda,"So our mission is to eradicate this ignorance, that they are living in a wrong conception of life. That is the point. The human society is making so-called progress under wrong conception of life. What is the answer? Therefore they have been described asmūḍhabecause they are living in a wrong conception, animal life. Wherefrom you have come?"
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:Kathmandu. Tonight I will go to Hyderabad. I am collecting money. But one thing I find even when we explain to these people, you know... Just like smoking cigarettes. In Kathmandu I was explaining to people, ""What kind of enjoyment is this from smoking cigarettes? You are coughing..."" This is the wayAcyutānandaSwami also describes, so I picked up from him. ""You are coughing. You are killing yourself."" He also described like this, ""Intoxication means poison. Toxic means poison. So this is intoxication. You are actually administering poison. What kind of sanity is this?"" So all those people, they told me, ""Well, I'll give up cigarettes later.""",Prabhupāda,"At least they admit the fault, hm? Do they?"
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:Yes, some people... One hippie I was talking to, he was saying, ""I believe in technology and Darwin's theory of evolution."" So I said, ""The greatest technologists in America have said that cigarettes can kill you. Why are you smoking these cigarettes?"" He said, ""Yes, I want to give it up,"" but then he kept on smoking. And to Indian people I explained aboutkarma,you know, ""according to your activity,"" and they all admit, ""Yes, there iskarma."" So I said, ""Why don't you serveKṛṣṇa?"" They said, ""Later, later."" They all say like that.",Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa.
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,"Dhṛṣṭaketu:So, your instructions inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamcan stop their lust? It can stop... By hearing from Vedic authorities, their lust can be dissolved? Or do they have to just simply be frustrated in their attempts to enjoy sense gratification?",Prabhupāda,They are being frustrated. Who is successful in the material world? Have you got any instance that he is successful? (pause) Then?

Vāsughoṣa:,Vāsughoṣa:They are practically committing suicide by their activities.,Prabhupāda,That is also another side. But practically you see.

Everyone is in insanity. They are trying to different way. They do not know the only solution is, asKṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇa...[Bg.18.66]. That they do not, neither they'll accept."
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:Especially Indian people, you know, they say, ""Well, if I surrender toKṛṣṇa, who will feed me?""",Prabhupāda,"No, no, Indian, American, everyone. Why you are, American, you are so proud of your...?"
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:No. (laughter) No, but because in India people know that they should surrender toKṛṣṇa, no?",Prabhupāda,But you also know.
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:But the general mass, I mean, of Americans, they don't understand.",Prabhupāda,"These are faulty, fault-finding. It is no good. Everyone.Kṛṣṇadid not say for Indian or American. For everyone. But at the present moment Indians are misled that they have been, I mean to say, induced to think that if they become like American or Western people they will be happy. That is misleading."
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:I was telling them that in America the big thing is they want to raise the standard of living, but then those people who had raised the standard of living, they are also killing themselves. But they don't want to listen. Actually in Nepal I was reading every day in the paper the king was saying that ""Our goal is economic development. That is the top priority. Number-one priority is economic development.""",Prabhupāda,Who? Which king?
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:King of Nepal, King Birendra. He's the onlyHinduking in the world. He has so many... He is embarking on so many programs of economic development in his country.",Prabhupāda,"Punaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30].They have been described as ""chewing the chewed.""

Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:That goes on perpetually until they receive the mercy of a pure devotee?,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Dhṛṣṭaketu:,Dhṛṣṭaketu:That frustration or that...,Prabhupāda,"Well...Kṛṣṇafailed to give mercy, and what devotee will do? They are stubborn to stick to their principle.Kṛṣṇasaid personally,sarva-dharmānparityajyamām[Bg.18.66],but who is going to do that? And what the devotees will do?"
Vāsughoṣa:,Vāsughoṣa:If we just engage them in devotional service will they ultimately become purified?,Prabhupāda,Yes. That is our mission. Somehow or other go on repeatedly saying.

Even on the way to here...,Prabhupāda,"And big, big swamis are saying, ""Yes, whatever you manufacture, it is all right.""Yathāmattathāpath:""Whatever ways you manufacture by concoction, that is all right."" So they are satisfied. If somebody says that ""You surrender unto me,"" that is not very palatable. If somebody says, ""No, you can surrender anywhere,"" that is very palatable."
Brahmānanda,Because that means no surrender. To surrender anywhere...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,...means no surrender.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:Many people say, ""We have to do ourkarma."" They are telling me, ""Do your duty.""",Prabhupāda,This is the duty: you surrender toKṛṣṇa. This is the only duty.
Brahmānanda,"Sometimes they say, ""When He wills it, then I will do it."" (laughter)",Prabhupāda,"Yes. This is not willing, when He says that ""You do this""?"
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:They say, ""When He makes my heart... When He puts it in my heart, and when He makes my heart open up to Him, then I will...""",Prabhupāda,"And you have no heart. You have simply stone. (laughter) That is sung by someVaiṣṇava, that ""My heart is harder than the stone, because I know that even the stone melts by chantingHareKṛṣṇa, but my heart does not melt. Therefore I think it is harder than the stone."""
Indian man (2):,"Indian man (2):Once somebody asked PrabhupādaMahārājain Calcutta that ""When can you show meKṛṣṇa?"" PrabhupādaMahārājasaid that ""Here isKṛṣṇa. You cannot see because your eyes are stones. They are not the eyes. If you have got the eyes, you can see it here.""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Indian man (2):,"Indian man (2):""And these people have not come to worship stone. They have come to seeKṛṣṇa, and they are decorating, and they know thatKṛṣṇais here."" That at Calcutta, you said.",Prabhupāda,Hm. So what did he say?

Then if everything is spiritual, then we can carry on just doing the same things that we're doing now, because it's all for God.",Prabhupāda,"No.Kṛṣṇasays that ""Everything is My energy, but...""Mat-sthānisarva-bhūtānināhaṁteṣu:[Bg.9.4] ""But I am not there."" This is the answer. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's expansion, but not that everything isKṛṣṇa."
Indian man (2):,Indian man (2):It is also not spiritual.,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Indian man (2):,"Indian man (2):The energy is there, but it is not spiritual.",Prabhupāda,"No, it is spiritual, but because I do not knowKṛṣṇa, therefore I see material. Just like this microphone. It is being used forKṛṣṇa; therefore it is spiritual. Actually, originally, it is fromKṛṣṇa. So we are not using these material things. Everything, whatever we using, that is spiritual."
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):Śrīla Prabhupāda, if this is spiritual, spiritual means eternal. But this microphone will fall to pieces.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, but scientifically it will keep the energy, conservation of energy. Even it is destroyed, it will remain. The material manifestation meansbhūtvābhūtvāpralīyate[Bg.8.19].It is sometimes destroyed and sometimes manifest. But the energy is there."
Indian man (2):,Indian man (2):And also remain in different form.,Prabhupāda,"Whatever it may be. Just like this is earth. Now you prepare hundreds or thousands of earthen pots and dolls. When it is destroyed, again it is earth. So when it is manifested, it is earth. When it is not manifested, it is earth. So from the spiritual energy ofKṛṣṇaeverything becomes manifested, and therefore originally it is spiritual.Kṛṣṇasaid,bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥkhaṁmanobuddhir...,bhinnāmeprakṛtiḥ:[Bg.7.4] ""It is Myprakṛti,energy."" So how Kṛṣṇa's energy can be material? Because we forgetKṛṣṇa, therefore it appears material.

Hari,"Hari-śauri:...Kṛṣṇa's energy is all-spiritual, then why inBhagavad-gītādoesKṛṣṇamake a distinction—""My separated material energy""? Why does He say, ""separated""?",Prabhupāda,"Separated... Just like I am talking and this will be reproduced as it is, although it is separated."
Hari,Hari-śauri:So He's not personally present there.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. When you replay, the same voice will come, but I am not there. So if you want to utilize this separated energy forKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then it will help you. Just like the Deity. Everyone knows it is stone, but why we are worshiping stone?"
Hari,Hari-śauri:It isKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,Yes. It is as good asKṛṣṇa. It is not worshiping the stone.Huh?

Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:""You should never see a graven image of God.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is required, because you are not competent to see God everywhere."
Brahmānanda,They say it is blasphemy.,Prabhupāda,"No. Yes, we also say. Although everything is expansion of the energy ofKṛṣṇa, not that everything isKṛṣṇa. That is the difference betweenMāyāvādaphilosophy andVaiṣṇavaphilosophy.Vaiṣṇavaphilosophy takes everything as expansion of Kṛṣṇa's energy.Parāsyabrāhmaṇaśaktiḥ.(Aside:)Jaya. Sarvedamakhilaṁjagat.Everything is expansion of the energy of the SupremeBrahman.Kṛṣṇaconfirms it,mayātatamidaṁsarvam.WithoutKṛṣṇa, there is no existence. But that does not mean anything existentional isKṛṣṇa. That isMāyāvādaphilosophy."
Brahmānanda,These religions even say that it is offensive to say the name of God.,Prabhupāda,"So what can I do? (laughter) If the rascal says something, so what can I do?"
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:""It's too holy to pronounce,"" that's what they...",Prabhupāda,"No, they can say, ""G, zero, and d."" (laughter) Zero between g and d. That is a nice explanation."
Devotee (4):,Devotee (4):Zero signifies their love for Him.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Zero is controlling both sides, g and d. Just like if you multiply something by zero, what it becomes?"
Brahmānanda,Zero.,Prabhupāda,That's all.Śūnyavādī.
Vāsughoṣa:,"Vāsughoṣa:[break] ...people are following very strictly, how can we preach to them? Some of those people who are following these religions very strictly, how do we preach to them, those people?",Prabhupāda,"Ask them, ""What do you mean by religion?"""

He says. See practically. Whatever we wanted, it is coming. It is coming not for my credit or another, anyone credit. It is all Kṛṣṇa's credit. He is giving. As soon as He sees that ""They are working for Me,"" He'll supply everything, whatever you need. Simply we must be sincere and spend it very cautiously, not squandering the money.

Brahmānanda,"They think it is freedom to be able to do whatever you feel, whatever you want.",Prabhupāda,"Rascal, where is your freedom? You are kicked out like football from one life to another. Where is your freedom, rascal? That they do not know. Therefore they areśūdras.He is being kicked out like football from this pole to that pole, and still he is thinking, ""I am free."""
Brahmānanda,They think reformation is a restriction.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Reformation means restriction. Civilized means restriction. Aryan means restriction. That is civilized life. Unrestricted life means cats and dogs. Laws are meant for restriction, and they are meant for the human society, not for the cats and dogs. Why the legislative assembly is there? Why the cars are going right or left? It is meant for the civilized person, not for the cats and dogs. So civilization means restriction. A dog can have sex life on the street, but you cannot have. That is restriction because you are civilized. Civilized means restriction. The more you restrict, more you become civilized. Otherwise you remain animal."
Brahmānanda,They say that these things are simply external.,Prabhupāda,"External, but you are animal. (laughs) You cannot understand. You see.Mūḍha.""External."" Why external? You violate the laws of nature; immediately you'll be punished. Why external? You infect some disease; you'll be immediately punished. Why external? It is the law of nature. You must have to follow; otherwise you'll be punished. You have got experience. If you touch fire... (aside:)HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.Jaya.HareKṛṣṇa. If you touch fire, then it must burn. Why? Can you restrict the fire? Similarly, laws of nature is so strict, as soon as you violate... Laws of nature means God's nature."
Brahmānanda,But by our technology we will change the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda,"That is your foolishness. What you have changed? Can you stop the fire burning your hand? Can you change this? Then why you talk foolish? These are foolish propositions. Nature will act. You may be so-called advanced in science. What is, your science will do? Will you not die? Will you not be diseased? Will you not become old? Then where is your advancement? You are strictly under the laws of nature. You cannot violate a single inch even.Daiv hy eṣ guṇamaymamamāyduratyayā.One sane man should consider that ""Why I am strictly under the laws of nature? I am prime..."" This question was put bySanātanaGosvāmī, that ""I am prime minister. People adore me aspaṇḍita,very learned, but why I am put into these tribulations of the laws of nature? Why as prime minister and learnedpaṇḍitaI cannot counteract it?"" This is real question. Simply doggish mentality: ""Yes, why shall I not do it? Why shall I?""—what will benefit you? That means you are not even sober. You are not human being. Human being should question ""Why?"" That is human being. Now by nature's law the river is full with water. If the nature does not supply, what you can do, your so-called science? Can you fill up with water? Then what is your science? Bogus. You cannot counteract the laws of nature. Hm? Can you?Brahmānandacan. (laughter) He is strong enough. Kartikeya, you can do it?"
Kartikeya (Indian Life Member):,"Kartikeya (Indian Life Member):No, I can't do it.",Prabhupāda,(laughs)HareKṛṣṇa.

Kartikeya:,Kartikeya:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Now these rascal Westerners, there the women claiming equal rights. Change that the man will give birth to a child and not the woman."
Kartikeya:,Kartikeya:Equal right.,Prabhupāda,"Equal rights. Make agreement. ""Once you beget; once I shall."" (laughs) Make this contract. Then it is equal right. If the woman has to give birth of a child and she has to suffer all the pains thereof, then where is the equal right? Where is equal right? Nature has said, ""You must suffer."" The husband, the so-called husband, will give birth, er, will utilize you for sex satisfaction, and you will be pregnant, and he will go away and you will suffer the whole life to maintain the child, welfare—""Give me some money""—or this or that. Where is equal right? He is free. He has gone away.Huh? This is general experience in the Western countries."
Brahmānanda,"""Unwed mothers.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. And she cannot also check that ""I shall not become mother."" For sex appetite she will agree, and the man will go away and she will suffer. Is that civilization?"
Brahmānanda,Each year there are over one million abortions.,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Brahmānanda,In America there are over one million abortions.,Prabhupāda,And they are advanced. They are proud of their being advanced. And they will not suffer? So we are trying to save the whole human society from rascaldom. That's all. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. You see? This isnīmtree. There is manynīmtrees. If they kindly accept and follow this movement they will be happy. Otherwise they are doomed. Let them suffer. What can I do? Thorough overhauling.
Brahmānanda,Woman carrying a water jug.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. What the women answer about this pregnancy, that the man enjoys her and he goes away?"
Brahmānanda,They resent it.,Prabhupāda,Then why do you accept? Why do you agree?
Brahmānanda,"Well, more and more now the women are not having sex with men anymore. They're having sex with other women.",Prabhupāda,Then the population will stop? Will the population stop anymore? Then where is the proof? Just see how foolishness.

Therefore you will find inHinduculture, every family, Lakṣm-Nārāyaṇaworship, the husband and wife. Still there are, there is some glimpse of human civilization in India. So we can revive it.
