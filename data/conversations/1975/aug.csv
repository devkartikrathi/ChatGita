Harikeśa,Yes.,Prabhupāda,I have seen all that.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):This iskīrtana.(a child? cow?),Prabhupāda,Kirtana?(laughter) That's all right. Havekīrtana.
Nityānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,That is ours?
Nityānanda,Way over the hill and back down there is all ours. In this field we have the calves. And in this field here we have the big cows.,Prabhupāda,It is not now utilized?
Nityānanda,Not... No. We are just growing hay. Grass for hay. We can sell the hay in the winter for a good price.,Prabhupāda,It is not possible to walk. [break] ...it is born?
Nityānanda,This one? Last week. His name is... Her name isLakṣmī. There is more over here. [break] Bull calves. We are getting more bulls than females.,Prabhupāda,Why?
Nityānanda,I don't know.,Prabhupāda,Then how utilize the bulls?
Nityānanda,To plow?,Prabhupāda,"Plow, transport. You have to engage more men for plowing. Two bulls will be required for each plow."
Nityānanda,We can go this way maybe? See the sugarcane?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Jagadīśa,This is not taking this yet?,Prabhupāda,No. Why?
Nityānanda,"We just cut it two days ago, and then it rained. We have to wait for it to dry before you can...",Prabhupāda,They will not be spoiled.
Nityānanda,"Yes, if it stays here too long, it will spoil.",Prabhupāda,And it rains.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):We will take it to the garden.,Prabhupāda,Then it will be soil? It will be fertilizer soil? Or no. When it is decomposed? [break] Drinking water?
Nityānanda,Milk.,Prabhupāda,Milk. (laughter) That is meant for calves? Those milk?
Nityānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,What is this?
Nityānanda,The barn.,Prabhupāda,"No, this part."
Nityānanda,"Oh, that's the door. It fell off. These are orange trees here.",Prabhupāda,Oh. How long it will take to grow?
Nityānanda,"Well, some down here already have a few oranges, but it will take a few years before they give a lot. They are very sweet kind. [break]",Prabhupāda,So small still. They are growing. [break]
Nityānanda,...sugarcane here. [break],Prabhupāda,...grow very high. [break] ...trees?
Nityānanda,Yes. [break],Prabhupāda,"...natural arrangement. Jungles—you cut the tree, make your home, and balance you make fuel. And the ground, plow and grow your food. That's all, natural."
Jagadīśa,Everything.,Prabhupāda,"In India still, in the villages they do not know, other than this wood fuel, anything else. They are misusing these trees by cutting, manufacturing paper, heaps of paper, in each house throwing daily. They do not read, but they are supplied heaps of paper and cutting these trees. Simply waste. Now wood and paper shortage all over the world. It takes so much time to grow, and one day they cut hundreds of trees like this and put into the paper mill. And heaps of paper is given every house, and he throws away. Then you bring garbage tank. In this way, waste."
Nityānanda,"There are some beehives down here behind this building. I have twelve, and every year we can get hundreds of pounds of honey. Honey is very nice because it does not spoil, just like ghee. It can keep for many, many months, or a long time. We can go up here to see the cows if you like. Right now they are milking them.",Prabhupāda,"So if we go, it will be disturbed?"
Nityānanda,"Oh, no.",Prabhupāda,"This is one sugarcane each? No. Two, three?"
Nityānanda,"Yes, at least three. People here in the country, they have lots of land, and they can grow the sugarcane very easily, but they will rather go to the store to buy the sugar.",Prabhupāda,"Because they want to live in the city. That is the... Here if they grow, then they will be engaged here. They cannot go to the city."
Nityānanda,The principal livelihood of our neighbors is to grow cows for slaughter.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That is all over Western countries.
Brahmānanda,There's a papaya.,Prabhupāda,They grow nicely here?
Harikeśa,Just keep the flies away.,Prabhupāda,"He is very friendly to the small calves, this child?"
Nityānanda,Yes. That's my boy.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Jagadīśa,He chases them all over.,Prabhupāda,"Just see. That is the difference between animal and man. A child can control so many calves.Kṛṣṇawas doing that. One stick in the hand of a child can control fifty cows. The child is controller of many cows; a man is controller of many children. In this way, controller, controller, controller, over, over, over... When there is final controller, that isKṛṣṇa.Īśvaraḥparamaḥkṛṣṇaḥ[Bs.5.1].This is the definition ofKṛṣṇa: ""the final controller."""
Nityānanda,Here is the cows here. We can see them from here.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Nityānanda,You hear it?,Prabhupāda,Yes. Then how the milk will be utilized?
Nityānanda,"We make sweet rice andburfi,we take the cream to make butter and ghee, and all extra milk is made into curd. So it is all used. Thirty gallons a day.",Prabhupāda,One gallon means 6 pounds?
Nityānanda,Eight and a half.,Prabhupāda,"Eight and a half pounds. In Vrindaban they get 1,000 pounds daily, New Vrindaban. What is that cottage?"
Nityānanda,"That's a little house for the pump, water pump.",Prabhupāda,This fencing was done before?
Nityānanda,Before. This farm was once owned by a person who grew race horses for racing and gambling.,Prabhupāda,Racing is also gambling.
Nityānanda,"The farm? 170,000. This field here is millet. It's a grass for the cows to eat. They give lots of milk because they eat this grass. Very nutritious.",Prabhupāda,You are not producing for man?
Nityānanda,Pardon?,Prabhupāda,Any grains for man?
Nityānanda,"No, we're not growing any grains for man right now. We have fruit trees in the yard. Pears, peaches, plums, figs.",Prabhupāda,Some growing?
Nityānanda,Not very much. They are very young. We just planted them. In a few years we will get lots of fruit.,Prabhupāda,Here the land is mixed with some stones? No.
Nityānanda,"I think they put this here, this gravel.",Prabhupāda,There is no mango tree here? No.
Nityānanda,We have some growing at the house.,Prabhupāda,Vegetables you are growing?
Nityānanda,"Yes. We have a garden across the street. All these big trees are pecan trees. We have twenty. All this land across the road here that is cleared is ours, all the way up to the trees.",Prabhupāda,"(reading sign?) ""Cow protection and God consciousness. Visitors welcome."" That's nice. So, which way we shall go now? Cow protection, they are surprised: ""What is this nonsense, cow protection?""Huh? Do they say? ""Cow is for eating, and you are protecting?"" There are falls?(?)"
Nityānanda,Falls?(?) No. This is our small garden.,Prabhupāda,"Fruits and flowers. No, only fruits. What you are doing, flowers?"
Nityānanda,This is okra.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, okra."
Nityānanda,"And sweet potatoes. And we have eggplants, tomatoes, and peppers here.",Prabhupāda,They give daily some fruits?
Nityānanda,Yes. And then we grow potatoes too.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, where? Which side?"
Nityānanda,"Well, the spring crop was already harvested. We have to plant the fall potatoes in a few weeks. We'll put them over there by the fence.",Prabhupāda,So it is nice farm. This is squash?
Nityānanda,That's a cantaloupe plant.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, cantaloupe. You can grow cantaloupe here?"
Nityānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,And also watermelon?
Jagadīśa,There is one big watermelon on thevineup there. Perhaps it's ready to eat.,Prabhupāda,"We are getting similar land, 600 acres, in Hyderabad."
Nityānanda,"We can go this way, here. This is all our machinery here.",Prabhupāda,"Hm. So already some machine idle. You had to spend so much, but they are lying idle. That is not good. That is the defect of machine. If you cannot ply it, then it is dead loss."
Brahmānanda,If you cannot what?,Prabhupāda,It is dead loss if you cannot work with the machine.
Brahmānanda,"Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,But when you go to purchase you have to pay lots of money. Now they will be rusty with water and gradually useless. How much money you have invested?
Nityānanda,Thousands.,Prabhupāda,"Just see. This is the defect of machine. If you cannot utilize it, then it is dead loss."
Nityānanda,"One's at the house, and one's in the field.",Prabhupāda,"So they have to be utilized or rejected, these machines?"
Nityānanda,"Yes, they all have a purpose. We use them from time to time.",Prabhupāda,But now they are kept open and the...
Nityānanda,"Well, we are building a shed to keep them out of the rain.",Prabhupāda,"In the meantime it will be finished. By the time you finish your shed, it is finished.Śāstreśāstredal phariyaga.(?) ""Some women were dressing to go to a fair, and when they were dressed, the fair was finished."" (laughter) Utilize them. Otherwise, while they are in working order, sell them. Don't keep in that way, neglected way. Either utilize it or sell it at any cost. Otherwise they are useless."
Devotee (4):,"Devotee (4):SrilaPrabhupāda? A materialist or someone who wouldn't know, he may say that when the bull is not plowing, all he is doing is eating. You have to pay money to feed him grain or to grow grain to feed the bull.",Prabhupāda,"They will grow, and they will eat. Rather, they will help you for your eating. The father also eats, but he maintains the family. Therefore the bull is considered as father and the cow as mother. Mother gives milk, and the bull grows food grains for man. ThereforeCaitanyaMahāprabhufirst challenged that Kazi that ""What is your religion, that you eat your father and mother?"" Both the bulls and the cows are important because the bull will produce food grain and the cow will give supply milk. They should be utilized properly. That is human intelligence. This is filling up with paddy or...? No?"
Nityānanda,"With food for the cows. This one has forage or fodder, and that one has grain.",Prabhupāda,So everything is for the animals. Nothing for the man?
Nityānanda,The cows give us milk.,Prabhupāda,That's all? And you are not growing any food grains? Why?
Brahmānanda,But you have so many machines.,Prabhupāda,All these machines require oiling and keeping nicely. Otherwise it will spoil.
Devotees in distance:,Devotees in distance:All glories toSrilaPrabhupāda!,Prabhupāda,Jaya.HareKṛṣṇa. They are starting?
Nityānanda,"Down the road we have fifteen acres of sorghum, grain for the cows.",Prabhupāda,"And everything for the cows, but what for the man? They will give everything for cows because they will eat cows, other farmers. But you utilize the animals for growing your food."
Brahmānanda,"The idea is we should maintain the animals, but then the animals should provide foodstuffs for the men.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,And that way there is cooperation.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. The animals, bulls, should have helped in spite of that... instead of that machine. Then it is properly utilized. And others, they cannot utilize these animals. Therefore, what they will do? Naturally they will send to slaughterhouse. But we are not going to send to the slaughterhouse. Then what we will do? They must be utilized. Otherwise simply for growing food that the cows and bulls we engage ourself? You are already feeling burden because there are so many bull calves. You were asking me, ""What we shall do with so many bulls?"""
Nityānanda,"Well, when they grow up we will train them as oxen.",Prabhupāda,"No, what the oxen will do?"
Nityānanda,Plow the fields.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is wanted. Transport, plowing fields. That is wanted. And unless our men are trained up,Kṛṣṇaconscious, they will think, ""What is the use of taking care of the plows (cows)? Better go to the city, earn money and eat them."" Which one?Huh? That? We shall get on?"
Brahmānanda,Yes. (end),Prabhupāda,"That is time for punishment. They should build up their character,śamaḥ,damaḥ,fully controlled. When they like, they becomegṛhasthas.Otherwise they are controlled. That isbrāhmaṇa.Forbrāhmaṇait is not compulsory to marry.Kṣatriyasmay marry more than one wife. They can take. So all girls must be married. That is... They must...They must have one husband, even the husband has got fifty wives. Then the problem of girls' marriage will be solved. And as soon as one girl is pregnant, she should be separated."
Hṛdayānanda,From the husband.,Prabhupāda,At least for one and half years.
Upendra,At the moment of pregnancy? From the moment of pregnancy one and a half years?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Pregnancy is understood at three months. From that month till further, sixteen months at least, she should not come to be near husband. That iseka-kadi(?). The child does not live. And they are not inclined to come unless a man induces. So the man, if he has got more than one wife, so man will not disturb her. And she will take rest for the next eighteen months. So after ten months she will give birth to the child, and for six months continually she will take care of the child. Feeding the child with breast milk, the child will be healthy. If the child can take mother's milk for six months at least continually, he'll become healthy for life."
Upendra,Where do they send that mother?,Prabhupāda,Where they'll take care.
Upendra,"If the man sends the woman away, where does she...?",Prabhupāda,"Our aim is not to give help, but not... Generally she goes to the father's house. So you can have separate building for that."
Nityānanda,Are you saying that our men should have more than one wife?,Prabhupāda,I have no objection.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:That's a difficult proposition.,Prabhupāda,Why?
Nityānanda,"No, it's a matter of... No one knows who is married or unmarried, but if you have...",Prabhupāda,That is not very difficult.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Well, the other difficulty, you brought this up several years ago, was that the men who take many wives have to be very select. Otherwise men will be attracted to join our movement for sex life, having different wives.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, unless our men are trained up, why you should allow to stay here and to wife. We want trained up men, not third-class picked-up. We want men who will follow the rules and regulations and fully trained up. Otherwise we don't want. We don't want ordinarykarmīsand... And if he agrees to be trained up, then we'll take. Otherwise what is the use of bringing some useless men? He must agree to produce his own food, and work. Our rules and regulations, he must follow. Then it will be ideal community. Otherwise, if you bring from here and there some men and fill up, that is not good thing. This is a training institution, to become devotee."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Everything we do, we don't hide it. We show the world what we're doing. I don't see how we could hide that one man had many different wives.",Prabhupāda,"If you don't call wife, you can have. The law allows you to keep boyfriend, girlfriend. Then the... Instead of calling ""husband,"" call ""friend."" That's all. But, er, it is risky and the man must be responsible to keep... To keep more than one wife by trained-up man is not disallowed."
Brahmānanda,"But I think they thought that he could get it legally established, at least in the state of California.",Prabhupāda,"Well then go and marry there. If the state of California allows that, then they all can go to California."
Nityānanda,The general public objects to that... It's very...,Prabhupāda,"Public we don't care. We... What is the public? We have got our own public here. So pub... What is the public? All rascals. They are killing cows and drinking and topless dance, bottomless dance. What is the value of this public? All rascals. I don't give any importance to this class of public, only after sense gratification, that's all. They have no ideals of life. They do not know what is God. What is the value of this public?Mūḍhas,they have been described,mūḍhas.You know the meaning ofmūḍha?"
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Ass.,Prabhupāda,Ass.Mūḍho nābhijānātimāmebhyaḥparamaṁmama.
Nityānanda,"The householders on our farm, they should cooperate and produce the food centrally or every householder should produce his own food independently?",Prabhupāda,No. Why they are living in a community centrally? Community means work everything for the community.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Some men can cultivate the fields, some men can take care of the cows, some men... They can (indistinct) responsible.",Prabhupāda,"No, it is service (?)."
Upendra,"One question I have, Prabhupāda... When I heard about New Vrindaban... I've not been there myself, so I cannot say firsthand, but I've talked with devotees have been there.",Prabhupāda,Near.
Upendra,"One would think because there's land and room for vegetables and there are so many cows that there would be a plentiful supply of milk, but I understand that they use powdered milk. The devotees use powdered milk there.",Prabhupāda,Why?
Upendra,Because they make all the milk into ghee and distribute it. And vegetables... I heard that at the temple that they use powdered milk. In Philadelphia I questioned the... That carpenter who made your table? He (indistinct).,Prabhupāda,Why powdered milk if there is sufficient milk?
Upendra,"I don't know. I can't say firsthand, but from the man who lived there, one of the householders who lived there, he said powdered milk...",Prabhupāda,I don't think so.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):I have heard that.,Prabhupāda,"No. This is not good. Ghee should be prepared where there is no more use. The Indian village, simply by keeping cows, they... Just likeNandaMahārājawas keeping cows. Similarly there are many villages. So the system is: they have got a bigpan, and whatever milk is collected, put into thatpan. It is being warmed. So they drink, the whole family members. They drink milk whenever they like. So whatever milk remains at night, they have to convert it into yogurt. The next day they use milk and yogurt also, as he likes. Then, after converting the milk into yogurt, still, it remains. It is stocked. So when there is sufficient old yogurt, they churn it and then butter comes out. So they take the butter, and the water separated from the butter, that is called whey? Whey, yes. So they... Instead ofdahl,they use this whey, forcapati.It will be very healthy and tasty. And then the butter they turn into ghee. So where is the loss, (indistinct)? You require (indistinct)."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Only after the whole milk is consumed, then the other...",Prabhupāda,"Milk you are collecting. So put in thepan. I have already explained. From milk stage to yogurt, yogurt to old yogurt, from old yogurt to butter, and then water, that whey. Then butter convert intogheeand whey, you can use, instead of drinking water, drink whey. Not a single drop of milk will be wasted, if you know how to do it. And you can take as much milk as possible, because ultimately it is going to be ghee. So if you start in the cities, nice restaurant, sogheecan be sold there. They'll pay for that. And they can prepare nice preparations,kachoris, samosa,sweetballs. Or milk, if you don't convert into yogurt, then naturally it will become... What is called?"
Brahmānanda,Curd.,Prabhupāda,"Curd. So curd you can send to the city. They will convert intosandeśa, rasagullāand other preparations, and ghee. That is being done. In India the villagers, they do that. They are, keep cows. Convert them into curd orghee,andgheeand curd sent to the city, they have got regular price for that. There is no question of waste of milk at any stage. One must know how to do it. So you can keep as many cows as possible and collect as much milk from them. You can utilize. And if some of the villagers trained up, they can open nice restaurant in the city. Utilize the ghee, curd, for making nice confectionary. People will purchase like anything. Just like in our Rathayātrā festival, whatever sweets they prepared, all sold at good profit. Your countrymen, they did not see such nice things. And when they taste it—""Very nice."""
Brahmānanda,They were selling onegulabjaminfor seventy-five cents.,Prabhupāda,"Just see. (laughs) It may cost two cent. And you have got your sugar also. In this way organize. Avoid machine. Keep everyone employed asbrāhmaṇa,askṣatriya,asvaiśya.Nobody should sit down.Brāhmaṇas,they are writers, editors, lecturers, instructors, worshiping Deity, ideal character. They have no anxiety for food, for clothing. Others should supply them. They haven't got to work.Sannyāsīis always preaching, going outside. In this way keep everyone fully engaged. Then it will be ideal. Otherwise people will criticize that we are simply eating and sleeping, escaping, so many, so many. And actually that is the position. Unless one is fully engaged, oh, that is not good. That istamo-guṇa. Tamo-guṇa,andrajo-guṇavery active, andsattva-guṇa,intellectual activity. Both of them, active, onlytamo-guṇa,not active. (indistinct)Tamo-guṇameans sleeping and laziness. These are the symptoms oftamo-guṇa.Every saintly man can avoid these two things—laziness and sleeping. Of course, as much you require, sleeping allowed, not more than... And keep everyone active, man or woman-all. Then it will be ideal society."
Nityānanda,Without a machine how can you make sugar from the cane?,Prabhupāda,Hand machine.
Nityānanda,Hand machine?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Nityānanda,Metal?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, they manufacture, hand, hand in the sugar cane, two men. Even we can prepare hand machine by cutting the wood. They do that. We are not against machine. You can utilize machine. But we should not allow others unemployed and use machine. This should be point. You can use. Use machine, that's good, but not at the risk of keeping others unemployed. This should be noted. First thing is that everyone should be employed. If you have got many men, then why should you engage machine. These rascals, they do not know. They're taking machine and keeping so many men unemployed. And the welfare department is paying them. They do not know how to organize society. And therefore hippies are coming out. Crime, criminals are coming out. (indistinct) The government is paying for becoming criminals and hippies and prostitutes. And how you can be happy, a society full of prostitutes, hippies, and criminals."
Brahmānanda,In New York City they now have one million people who are receiving welfare.,Prabhupāda,And all criminals.
Brahmānanda,"Yes. All criminals, prostitutes, and hippies.",Prabhupāda,"Because the government is paying for that, and they are now thinking that ""What to do about crime?"" This is rascaldom. You act in such a way, then repent later on."
Brahmānanda,"There was one boy from Sweden, he was our devotee. And then he fell intomāyā.He returned to Sweden. Now he's getting from the government fifty dollars a week. So he's using that money to buy drugs. So now he's completely trapped.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,"He gets money regularly, and he can never get out of the habit.",Prabhupāda,"In your country also. One keeps a girlfriend, the girl's getting welfare, and he is purchasing drugs, and then their husband goes. I have seen. Some of our students have been. I have seen them."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:That's very prominent.,Prabhupāda,And making trade. That is going on.
Brahmānanda,So this is thevarṇāśramasystem that you are...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,Thisvarṇāśramacollege...,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Varnāśramameans everyone should be engaged. There will be no, I mean to say, (indistinct)."
Jagadīśa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, what exactly do the... Do thevaiśyascultivate the fields or theśūdrascultivate the fields?",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Jagadīśa,Is it the duty of thevaiśyasto cultivate the fields or...?,Prabhupāda,"Actually it is the duty of thevaiśyas,but theśūdrascan help everyone, the helpers. Theśūdraswill help thebrāhmaṇas,thekṣatriyas,as well as thevaiśyas.Those who have no brain—simply they can carry out order—they areśūdras.And those who have got brain, they can act asbrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,orvaiśya.They have got brain to take the initiative. First-class brain, they should be engaged in studyingśāstras,writing books and in the worship of the Deity, lecturing enlightened people. This isbrāhmaṇa.They haven't got to work askṣatriya,asvaiśya.They are simply intellectuals. This isbrāhmaṇa,with good character."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Distributing books?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And the distribution book can be done by thevaiśya,trade. It is a trade.Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyam[Bg.18.44].Kṛṣi,agriculture, giving protection to cows, and distributing or trading. If you have got enough grains you can trade. Make money. If you have got enough vegetables, you can trade. That is the business ofvaiśya.Sovaiśyadoes not require any university degree or any... Nobody requires university degree. That is a false thing. Andbrāhmaṇashould be very highly learned scholar. So thebrāhmaṇaswill give advice to thekṣatriyahow to rule, and thekṣatriyawill levy tax, andvaiśyaswill produce food. Then the society will be perfect."
Devotee:,Devotee:What kind of tax?,Prabhupāda,"Hm? Tax means... Everyone must have some income for maintaining. Sobrāhmaṇas,they(?) doesn't require any... They will live on the contribution of the society. Because they are giving for free service, so valuable service, knowledge, so they are provided by thekṣatriyasand thevaiśyas.So they have no anxiety for earning livelihood. Things are coming. Just like we are maintained. At least people give to me contribution. So similarly,brāhmaṇawill live at the cost of others' contribution. That is source of income.Kṣatriyas,they'll levy tax.Kṣatriyais given land. Now he divides the land. I have got, say, two thousand acres of land. So I divide to thevaiśyas,one thousand this man, one thousand this man, one thousand. So on condition that ""I give you this land. You produce foodstuff or utilize any way. You give me twenty-five percent."""
Brahmānanda,Twenty-five percent of the produce?,Prabhupāda,Whatever you have produced.
Brahmānanda,Not necessarily money.,Prabhupāda,No.
Brahmānanda,But the produce.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,The grains or the milk or whatever.,Prabhupāda,"Whatever, yes. ""Give me twenty-five percent. You can utilize the land."" So that is resource of the land."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):How does thekṣatriyabuild a palace for himself or something like that?,Prabhupāda,"That will be done. To keep a prestigious position, they'll have building, servant, soldiers. Otherwise how they will fear? How they'll have respect?"
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):So thekṣatriyais the predominator of the land.,Prabhupāda,Yes.Kṣatriyais the owner of the land.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):And he can take the stones and men and build a big, nice...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee:,Devotee:...palace.,Prabhupāda,"They,śūdrasare there. Give him his eating, and some hand, pocket expense, hand expense, regular. If one can eat, then he has no demand. So the laborer has to be given to eat sumptuously. ""Eat and work, take some pocket..."" They will be (indistinct). Not that you call professional laborer and you have to pay twenty-five dollars per hour. That is nuisance. They'll drink. That's all. And not that everyone should have nice house. Why? What is the use? Go in the village, live simple, produce food. That's all. Eat. Why this electricity and three-hundred story building and...? And then you don't produce anything, eat fish. ""And let me eat..."" Artificial. It is very easy to take the animals in the city and slaughter. A little vegetable and milk, they are satisfied."
Jagadīśa,Even in the culture of Europe they had kings who had a certain territory and then they would appoint men called vassals to take care of different sections and then the serfs would work on the land.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is system, whole world. They were called... In India they were calledzamindars,Mohammedans, and theHinduzamindars, small kings. Thezamindarsare called king also. Anyone who owns land, he is called king."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Just likeNandaMahārāja, he also had land.NandaMahārāja.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. He was therefore called king. But he was avaiśya.He engaged his land for agriculture and cow keeping. AndKṛṣṇatook charge of the cows, the calves, although still calf, He, (indistinct) This is the system. He was going with the calves whole day, playing with the boys and taking care of the cows, in the evening come back. Mother then washes and bathes and gives nice food. And immediately goes to sleep. AndKṛṣṇais clever. At night He goes to thegopīs.(laughter) Then motherYaśodādid not know, when she thought, ""My good son is sleeping."" And thegopīsalso would come at a place and they'll dance. This is called life, childhood life. And when He was grown up, then He was brought to, I mean to say,Mathurāand He fought with His maternal uncle, killed him, and then His fatherVasudeva, took care, sent Him to, what is that? SāndīpaniMuni. He was educated. He was learning every subject every day. Then He was taken toDvārakā, married so many queens, and became king. In the Kṛṣṇa's life, He's always busy.Kṛṣṇa... You'll never find from the very beginning of His life He's busy killingPutana,Aghasura, Bakasura, and His friends, they are confident. They'll enter into the mouth ofAghasura. ""Oh,Kṛṣṇais there. He will kill."" This isVṛndāvana. There is no need and I don't find inBhāgavatabig factory and slaughterhouse, no. Nothing. The whole atmosphere is surcharged with sinful life. How people will be happy? Now they are coming to crimes and hippies and so many things, problems, diplomacy, CIA and what other? So many unnecessary waste of energy, time, and money. Vicious condition. Better give up city. MakeVṛndāvana, like this. City life is abominable. If you don't live in the city, you don't require petrol, motor car. It is no use. They may criticize that ""You are going to the farm in a car."" So for the time being, there is no vehicle. Otherwise bullock cart—where is the difficulty? Suppose you are coming, one hour, and it takes one day. And if you are satisfied, such life, there is no question of moving. Maybe local moving, from this village to that village. That is sufficient, bullock carts. Why motor car? Drive here and park problem. Not only park problem, there are so many things. There are three thousand parts, motor car. You have to produce them, big factory."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Insurance.,Prabhupāda,"Insur... So much! Everyone is being (indistinct). We do not decry, but we point out, ""In this way our valuable time of life is being wasted."" They say it is primitive life, but it is peaceful life. We want peaceful life and save time forKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is not primitive. That is intelligent life."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:In order to evidence this, should we consider that we have to act askṣatriyasor shall we just preach and try to get others...",Prabhupāda,"No...Kṣatriyas,I have already explained who isbrāhmaṇaandkṣatriyaaccording toguṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ[Bg.4.13],as you work, as you are fit for. If you are fit to becomebrāhmaṇa,becomebrāhmaṇa.If you are fit to becomekṣatriya,becomekṣatriya.If you are fit to becomeśūdra,do it. Three... Then... And a man who cannot become fit for any other purpose, he isśūdra.That's all. ""Help. Help thebrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśyaand take your food and little pocket expense. That's all."" Little pocket expenditure. But in our society we don't require, but even if it is required we can give."
Brahmānanda,So eventually we should divide up our society in this way? Our members...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, just to show people how to... The first-class men,brāhmaṇa,second-class,kṣatriya,third-class,vaiśya,fourth-class..."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:But all in our society are Vaiṣṇavas.,Prabhupāda,That is our real position. This is for management.
Nityānanda,How manykṣatriyascan I have on this farm? How manykṣatriyascan we have on one farm?,Prabhupāda,I told. Find out who is going to bekṣatriya.Then... Take your time (?).
Nityānanda,You can have more than one?,Prabhupāda,"No, no. (Why not??) There is no rule. As according to the work, if people are interested to work asvaiśya,let them becomevaiśya.If he is intelligent, if he wants to work asbrāhmaṇa,let him work asbrāhmaṇa.Let him work askṣatriya.And the fourth-class, let him work asśūdra.So the management should see that nobody is unemployed or not engaged, men, women. Woman can take care of the milk products or spining (spinning). Andśūdrascan be engaged for working as weaver, as a blacksmith, a goldsmith. There are so many things."
Jagadīśa,Cobbler?,Prabhupāda,"Cobbler is less thanśūdra.Yes. Cobbler means when the cows die, the cobbler may take it. If he wants, he can eat the flesh, and he can utilize the bone, hoofs. He can prepare... He gets the skin without any price. So he can make shoes and he'll make some profit. And because he is cobbler, he can be allowed to eat meat, fifth-class... Not that ""Professor such-and-such,"" and eating meat. This is the degradation of society. He is doing the work of abrāhmaṇa—teacher meansbrāhmaṇa—and eating meat-Oh, horrible! Śyāmasundara? So make, organize. I can give you the idea, but I'll not live very long. If you can carry out, you can change the whole... Especially if you can change America, then whole world will change. Then the whole world... And it is the duty because they are kept in darkness and ignorance, then the human life is being spoiled. These rascals, because they do not know how to live...Andhāyathāndhair...They are blind, and they are leading... Others are blind, and they are leading and they, all of them, going to ditch. So it is the duty. There is...Caitanyahas explained,para-upakāra.Save them. If it is not possible to save everyone, as many as possible... This is human life. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness, to save others who are in the darkness. It is not a profession: ""Now,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness is my profession. I'm getting very easily food and shelter."" Just like the Indians, they are doing, a profession, say another means of livelihood. Not like that. It is forpara-upakāra,actually benefiting the others. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. ThenKṛṣṇawill be very much pleased: ""Oh, he is trying."" 'CauseKṛṣṇapersonally comes for doing this benefit to the people, and if you do, then how muchKṛṣṇawill be pleased. Then? Just like I am traveling in my centers, and if I see that my students, my men are doing very nice, everything is going nice, how much pleased I will be, that I'll save my labors and now write books for the rest of my time. Similarly, ifKṛṣṇasees that you are, on behalf ofKṛṣṇa, you are trying to save these rascals, then He'll be very (indistinct) with you. They are rascals. The leaders are rascals and the followers are rascals and they're all going to hell. Nature's law is very strict.Daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14].You cannot avoid it. Nature is all-powerful.Kṛṣṇahas given: ""You work in this way."" She'll work. She'll work. She'll punish. As soon as there is little discrepancy—you have eaten, eaten more than is necessary-indigestion. ""Indigestion, starve."" This is nature's law. Nature will act. But you have to (indistinct) them with knowledge that ""You don't do this. Otherwise you will be under the control of nature life after life. Simply miseries.""Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.Vaiṣṇava's qualification ispara-duḥkha-duḥkhī.He is unhappy by seeing others' distress. This isVaiṣṇava. (end) ""Money means happiness."" This is the civilization. And after getting money, drink wine and topless, bottomless, and go to hell."" That's all. This is their position,mūḍha,rākṣasa,thinking that ""I am living this fifty years or hundred years so luxuriantly. That is the fulfillment of life."" Because he does not know the life is eternal, one spot he is taking very important. The meaning of life, what is the aim of life—""Don't bother. Enjoy."" And what is that enjoyment?Yanmaithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham[SB7.9.45].Is that enjoyment? [break] ...used in theBhagavad-gītā,mūḍha,it is very appropriate. No knowledge.
