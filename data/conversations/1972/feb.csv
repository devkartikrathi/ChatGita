Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:...1972 in Māyāpura. Conversations between Śrīla Prabhupāda and Bob, a Peace Corps worker, entitled ""Perfect Questions, Perfect Answers."" [break] (Devotees are singing prayers to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva loudly over loudspeaker in background.)",Prabhupāda,...because he knows things as they are.
Bob Cohen:,Bob Cohen:(indistinct) ...knows things as they are.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,Bob:He hopes he knows things as they are.,Prabhupāda,"No, he's supposed to know. We approach to a scientist because he's supposed to know the things right. (A loudspeaker is playing very loudly in the background.) Let them make a little soft. [break] (laughter) Great relief. (laughter)"
Bob:,Bob:I have felt that the loudspeakers were too loud all day.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:And I mentioned it to somebody.,Prabhupāda,It is pinching.
Bob:,Bob:Yeah. It loses some maybe transcendentalism through the amplifier.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. Ask them to make it softer. So scientist means one who knows things as they are. That is scientist. SoKṛṣṇameans all-attractive. (Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break] So just like your daughter, she was also... I was little older, so I was beating her like anything. (laughter) (pause) SoKṛṣṇameans all-attractive."
Bob:,Bob:All-attractive.,Prabhupāda,All-attractive.
Bob:,Bob:All-attractive.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So unless God becomes all-attractive, how He can become God? (pause) A man is important when he's attractive. Is it not?"
Bob:,Bob:It is so.,Prabhupāda,"So, God must be attractive and attractive for all. Therefore, if God has got any name, or if you want to give any name to God, only ""Kṛṣṇa"" can be given."
Bob:,Bob:But why only the nameKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,"Because all-attractive.Kṛṣṇa, this word, means all-attractive."
Bob:,"Bob:Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. God has no name, but by His quality we give His name."
Bob:,Bob:May He be called...?,Prabhupāda,"Just like if a man is very beautiful, we call ""beautiful."" If a man is very intelligent, we call him ""wise."" So name is given according to the quality. Because God is all-attractive, therefore the only nameKṛṣṇacan be applied to Him.Kṛṣṇameans all-attractive."
Bob:,"Bob:What about a name meaning ""all-powerful""?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Attractive means... Unless you are powerful, how you can be attractive? (laughter)"
Acyutānanda,It includes everything.,Prabhupāda,"Includes everything. He must be very beautiful, He must be very wise, He must be very powerful, He must be very famous..."
Bob:,Bob:IsKṛṣṇaattractive to rascals?,Prabhupāda,Oh yes. He was the greatest rascal also.
Bob:,Bob:How is this?,Prabhupāda,(laughing) Because he was teasing always thegopīs.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Teasing?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. The Rādhārāṇī would go, because She was married andKṛṣṇawill attack Her. And when She fall down, ""Kṛṣṇa, don't torture Me in that way,"" She will fall down, andKṛṣṇawill take the opportunity and kiss her. (Prabhupāda laughs) So from superficially, Rādhārāṇī was very pleased, but superficiallyKṛṣṇais a great, the greatest rascal. Unless rascaldom is not inKṛṣṇa, how rascaldom is there, existence in the world? Because our formula of God is that He's the source of everything. Ask her not to talk. (Shouts at someone in Bengali)Kathakaibenā!Kathakaibenā.Unless rascaldom is not inKṛṣṇa, how it can be manifest. Because He's the source of everything. But His rascaldom is so nice that everyone worships His rascaldom."
Bob:,Bob:But what about the rascals who are not so nice?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,Bob:What about...,Prabhupāda,"No, rascaldom is not nice. ButKṛṣṇais absolute God, therefore rascaldom is also good.Kṛṣṇais all-good. God is good."
Bob:,Bob:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore, when He becomes a rascal, that is also good. That isKṛṣṇa. Rascaldom is not good, but when it is practiced byKṛṣṇa, because He's absolute good, that rascaldom is also good. That one has to understand."
Bob:,Bob:Are there some people who do not findKṛṣṇaattractive?,Prabhupāda,"It is not the..., no question of some people.Kṛṣṇacannot be compared with some people. He's God."
Bob:,"Bob:No, do some people find Him not attractive?",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,Bob:Do some people findKṛṣṇanot attractive?,Prabhupāda,"No. Anyone will find Him... Some people must be of some kind. Youciteany kind of people, he'll be attracted. Who's not attracted? Just place a man, example, that ""This man or this living entity is not attracted toKṛṣṇa."" Just find out."
Bob:,"Bob:Somebody who wishes to do things in life that he may feel are wrong, but he wishes to do to gain power or prestige or money...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,"Bob:...may find God unattractive. He may not find the God attractive, because God gives him guilt.",Prabhupāda,"No, not the God. Because he wants to be powerful, his attraction is to become powerful. A man wants to become powerful, or rich. Is that not? But nobody is richer thanKṛṣṇa. Therefore,Kṛṣṇais attractive to him."
Bob:,"Bob:So if a rich, if a person who wants to become rich prays toKṛṣṇa, will he become rich?",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Bob:,Bob:He can become rich through this means.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Oh, yes. BecauseKṛṣṇais all-powerful. If you pray toKṛṣṇato become rich,Kṛṣṇawill make you rich."
Bob:,"Bob:But even if you do not live, even if you live an evil life you will still become rich?",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,"Bob:If somebody lives an evil life but prays to become rich, they may still become rich?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Prays toKṛṣṇa, that is not evil."
Bob:,"Bob:All right, I... Oh, yeah.",Prabhupāda,"(chuckling) Somehow or other, he prays toKṛṣṇa, so you cannot say that He's evil."
Bob:,Bob:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇasays in theBhagavad-gītā,apicetsudurācārobhajatemāmananya-bhāk[Bg.9.30].You have read it?"
Bob:,"Bob:Yeah. I think, the Sanskrit I don't know, but the English maybe I do. Is it ""Even if the most evil man prays to Me...""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,"Bob:""...then he will be elevated.""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:Something like that.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So as soon as he begins to pray toKṛṣṇa, that is not evil. Therefore He is all-attractive."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda,Why don't you cover?
Devotee:,"Devotee:I covered the outside with a cloth, I didn't want to disturb you; so I put thick cloth on the outside.",Prabhupāda,You have covered?
Devotee:,Devotee:Yes. [break],Prabhupāda,Kaṁsa... You know Kṛṣṇa's life?
Bob:,"Bob:Not, not much.",Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇa's mother... (pause-background noise is very loud) [break] ...theVedasthat the Absolute Truth or the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all pleasure-rasovaisaḥ.Everyone is hankering after something because he relishes some mellow in it.
Bob:,Bob:Excuse me?,Prabhupāda,Some mellow.
Bob:,"Bob:Ah, some mellow.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Just like a man is drinking. Why he's drinking? He's getting some mellow out of that drinking. A man is hankering after money because by possessing money he gets a mellow out of it.
Bob:,Bob:What does mellow mean? Maybe I...,Prabhupāda,What is mellow?
Bob:,"Bob:Oh, O.K.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, pleasure. Pleasing taste. SoVedassay,rasovaisaḥ.The exact Sanskrit translation of mellow israsa.What is that?"
Mālatī,Eggplant fried.,Prabhupāda,Oh! (laughter) All-attractive! All-attractive! You are becoming all-attractive!
Mālatī,No.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, No more, no more! No more attraction! (laughing) Where is your all-attractive daughter?"
Mālatī,She is in all-attractivemāyā.,Prabhupāda,"Actually, she's all-attractive. (chuckling) Everyone loves her. [break]...Kṛṣṇa, the Reservoir of All Pleasure."
Bob:,Bob:This must be a new book.,Prabhupāda,Yes. [break]
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:How isKṛṣṇathe greatest scientist?,Prabhupāda,"Because He knows everything. A scientist means one who knows a subject matter thoroughly. He's scientist.Kṛṣṇa, He knows everything."
Bob:,"Bob:You said... I told you I teach science. You had said something about teaching, or teaching of science.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Teaching, unless you have got perfect knowledge how you can teach? That is our proposition."
Bob:,"Bob:Without perfect knowledge, though, you can teach what knowledge you have.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is cheating. That is not teaching, that is cheating. Just like the scientists said, ""There was a chunk, and the creation took place, perhaps..."" What is this? Simply cheating. It is not teaching, it is cheating."
Bob:,"Bob:Let me say what else you said this morning that was interesting. I asked him about miracles, and Prabhupāda said that only a fool would believe in miracles because... Let us say you are a child and an adult lifts this table. That's a miracle. Or you're a chemist, and you combine acid and base and make smoke, an explosion or whatever. To somebody ignorant, that's a miracle. And for everything there's a process. And so when you see a miracle, it's just ignorance of the process. So that only a fool would believe in miracles, and, you correct me if I say wrong...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Bob:,"Bob:...that when Jesus came, the people then were somewhat more ignorant and needed miracles as aid. Was that... I wasn't sure if that's quite what you said.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes, yes. Miracle means ignorant."
Bob:,Bob:I had asked this in relation to all the miracle men you hear about in India.,Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇais the highest miracle man.
Bob:,Bob:Yes.,Prabhupāda,That is stated byKuntī.
Bob:,"Bob:Without perfect knowledge, can I not teach some things? For example, I may...",Prabhupāda,"You can teach up to that, which point you know."
Bob:,Bob:But should not claim to teach more than I know.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is cheating."
Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:In other words, you can't teach the truth...",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:...you can't teach the truth with partial knowledge.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is not possible by any human being. Because any human being, his senses are imperfect. So how he can teach perfect knowledge? Just like you see the sun like a disc. You have no means to approach the sun. If you say, ""We can see the sun by telescope and this and that,"" that is also made by you. And you are imperfect, your instrument is imperfect. Because that telescope you can say that you are seeing, but that machine is made by you, and you are imperfect. How your machine can be perfect? Therefore your knowledge of the sun is imperfect. So you don't teach about sun unless you have got perfect. That is cheating."
Bob:,"Bob:But what about to teach that it is supposed that the sun is 93,000,000 miles away?",Prabhupāda,"As soon as you say ""it is supposed,"" it is not scientific."
Bob:,"Bob:Yeah, but I think almost all of science, then, is not scientific. Because all science... (laughter)",Prabhupāda,That is the point.
Bob:,"Bob:Oh, I see. Is based on, you know, suppositions of this or that. So imperfect knowledge may be taught...",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,Bob:Imperfect...,Prabhupāda,They're teaching imperfect. Just like they are advertising so much about moon. Do you think the knowledge is perfect.
Bob:,Bob:No.,Prabhupāda,Then?
Bob:,Bob:What do you think is the proper duty of the teacher?,Prabhupāda,No more.Huh?
Bob:,Bob:What is the proper duty of the teacher in society? Let's say a science teacher. What should he be doing in the classroom?,Prabhupāda,"Classroom, you should simply teach aboutKṛṣṇa."
Bob:,Bob:He should not teach about...,Prabhupāda,"No, that will include everything. But his aim should be how to knowKṛṣṇa."
Bob:,Bob:Can a scientist teach the science of combining acid and alkaline and this kind of science withKṛṣṇaas its object?,Prabhupāda,How it can be?
Bob:,"Bob:If you... When one studies science, one finds general tendencies of nature, and these general tendencies of nature point to a controlling force.",Prabhupāda,"That I was explaining the other day. Where? In Madras, or where? ""Who has supplied these chemicals?"""
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Ah, in Madras.",Prabhupāda,"I asked one chemist that according to chemical formula, hydrogen and oxygen mixed, it becomes water. Is it not?"
Bob:,Bob:That's true.,Prabhupāda,"Now, this vast water in the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, how much chemicals were required?"
Bob:,Bob:How much?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,"Bob:Oh, I don't know.",Prabhupāda,How many tons?
Bob:,Bob:Many.,Prabhupāda,So who supplied it?
Bob:,Bob:This was supplied by God.,Prabhupāda,Somebody must have supplied.
Bob:,Bob:Yes.,Prabhupāda,So that is... You can teach like that.
Bob:,Bob:And should one bother teaching that if you combine acid and alkaline...,Prabhupāda,"The same thing, the same thing, that now we have to..., that... There are so many effervescence. So, who is performing it? Who is supplying the acid and alkaline? (pause)"
Bob:,Bob:So this comes from the same source as the water.,Prabhupāda,"Um hmm. Yes. Water you cannot manufacture unless you have got hydrogen and oxygen. So here is a vast... Not only this Atlantic or Pacific, there are millions of planets, and there are millions of Atlantic and Pacific oceans. So who created this water with hydrogen and oxygen, and how it was supplied? That is our question. Somebody must have supplied; otherwise how it came to existence?"
Bob:,"Bob:But should it also be taught how you make water from hydrogen and oxygen? The procedure of burning them together, should this also be taught? That if you burn hydrogen and oxygen together...",Prabhupāda,That is secondary.
Bob:,Bob:Excuse me?,Prabhupāda,"That is secondary. That is not very difficult. Just like thisMālatīmadepurī.So there is flour and there is ghee, and she madepurī,but unless there is ghee and flour, where is the chance of makingpurī?(pause) In theBhagavad-gītāthere is this, ""Water, earth, air, fire, they are made of My energy."""
Bob:,"Bob:Made of, what is that?",Prabhupāda,"""My energy."""
Bob:,Bob:Ah.,Prabhupāda,"(Bengali?) What is your body. This external body, that is your energy. Do you know that? The body is made out of your own energy. Just like I am eating."
Bob:,Bob:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"So I am creating some energy, and therefore my body is maintained."
Bob:,"Bob:Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda,So therefore your body is made out of your energy.
Bob:,"Bob:But when you eat the food, there is energy from the sun in the food...",Prabhupāda,"No, that... I am giving the example, I am creating some energy by digesting the food and that is maintaining my body. Therefore my body is maintained by my energy. If your energy supply is not proper, then your body becomes not in proper order. Therefore the conclusion is that your body is made out of your own energy. Similarly, why this big gigantic body, universes, is not made of Kṛṣṇa's energies? How can you deny? As your body is made out of your energy, similarly, the universal body must be made by somebody's energy. That isKṛṣṇa. (pause)"
Bob:,Bob:I have to think about that. I have to think about it to follow that.,Prabhupāda,Why follow? It is a fact. (Bob laughs) Your hairs are growing daily. Why? Because you have got some energy.
Bob:,Bob:The energy I obtain from my food.,Prabhupāda,"Somehow or other, you have obtained that energy. And through that energy your hairs are growing. So if your body is manufactured by your energy, similarly, the whole gigantic manifestation is made of God's energy. It is a fact it is not your energy."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Just like, aren't the planets in this universe the sun's energy, a product of the sun's energy?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. But who produced the sun? That is Kṛṣṇa's energy. Because it is heat, andKṛṣṇasays,bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥ[Bg.7.4].Analaḥ,analaḥ,heating. ""That is My energy."" The sun is representation of the heating energy ofKṛṣṇa. It is not your energy. You cannot say that ""The sun is made by me."" But somebody must have made. AndKṛṣṇasays. So we believe thereforeKṛṣṇa. Therefore we areKṛṣṇa-ites."
Bob:,Bob:Kṛṣṇites.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Our knowledge is perfect. You cannot say... If I say that ""Heat is energy ofKṛṣṇa,"" you cannot defy it. Because it is not your energy. Just like in your body there is some certain extent of heat. Similarly... Heat is somebody's body's energy. And who is that body? That isKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays, ""Yes, it is My energy."" So my knowledge is perfect. Therefore I am the greatest scientist. Because I take the version of the greatest scientist, therefore I am greatest scientist. I may be fool personally, but because I take the knowledge from the greatest scientist, I am greatest scientist. I have no difficulty."
Bob:,Bob:Excuse me?,Prabhupāda,"I have no difficulty to become the greatest scientist. Because I take the knowledge from the greatest scientist. (pause) [break] ""This earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and ego—they are My eight separated energies."""
Bob:,Bob:They're separate energies?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,Separated.,Prabhupāda,"Separated. Separate, no? Just like this milk. What is this milk? The separated energy of the cow. Is it not? It is the manifestation of the separated energy of cow."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Is it like a by-product?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:So what is the significance of this energy being separated fromKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,"Separated means this is made out of the body of the cow, but is is not cow. That is separation."
Bob:,"Bob:So this earth and all is made out ofKṛṣṇa, but is notKṛṣṇa?",Prabhupāda,"It is notKṛṣṇa. Or you can say,Kṛṣṇaand notKṛṣṇasimultaneously. That is our philosophy. One and different. You cannot say different because these things withoutKṛṣṇahas no existence. At the same time you cannot say, ""Then let me worship water. WhyKṛṣṇa?"" That the pantheists, they say, that ""Because everything is God, so whatever I take, that is God worship."" TheRama-Krishna Mission says like that. But that's wrong."
Bob:,Bob:TheRama-Krishna Mission says that?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And the Māyāvādīs. ""Because everything is made of God, therefore everything is God."" That is their... But our philosophy is everything is God, but not God also."
Bob:,Bob:So what on earth is God? Is there anything on earth that is God?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Because it is made out of the energy of God. (pause) But (that) does not mean that anything you worship, you worship God."
Bob:,"Bob:So what is on earth, though, is notmāyā.It is...",Prabhupāda,māyāmeans energy.
Bob:,Bob:It means energy.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.māyā,another meaning: illusion. So foolish persons, the energy is accepted as the energetic. That ismāyā.Just like sunshine. Sunshine enters your room. Sunshine is the energy of the sun. But because the sunshine has entered in your room you cannot say the sun has entered. If sun enters, then your room and yourself, everything will be finished immediately. (laughter) You'll not have the leisure to understand that sun has entered. Is it not?"
Bob:,Bob:It is so.,Prabhupāda,"But you cannot say that sunshine is not sun. But without sun, where is the sunshine? So you cannot say sunshine is not sun. But at the same time it is not sun. It is sun and not sun, both. That is our philosophy.Acintya-bhedābheda,inconceivable. In the material science you cannot conceive that a thing simultaneously positive and negative. That you cannot think. That is inconceivable energy. And because everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy,Kṛṣṇacan manifest Himself from any energy, and act. Therefore, when we worshipKṛṣṇamade of something of earth, water, or something like that, that isKṛṣṇa, that is not Kṛṣṇ... You cannot say it is notKṛṣṇa. When you worship this metal form ofKṛṣṇa, that isKṛṣṇa. That's a fact. Because metal is energy ofKṛṣṇa. Therefore it is non-different fromKṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa's so powerful that He can present Himself fully in His energy. So this Deity worship is not heathenism. It is actually worshiping God, provided you know the process."
Bob:,"Bob:If you know the process, then the Deity becomesKṛṣṇa?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Not becomes, it (is)Kṛṣṇa."
Bob:,Bob:The Deity isKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:But only if you know the process of it.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like this electric wire isKṛṣṇa..., er, is electricity. One who knows the process he can derive electricity out of it."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Otherwise it's just wire.,Prabhupāda,That's all.
Bob:,"Bob:So if I build a statue ofKṛṣṇa, it is notKṛṣṇa. But if I, unless I know the process...",Prabhupāda,"No, it isKṛṣṇa. But you have to know the process that it isKṛṣṇa. It isKṛṣṇa."
Bob:,"Bob:It is not just earth and mud, it isKṛṣṇa...",Prabhupāda,"No, earth... Earth has no separate existence withoutKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays, ""It's my energy."" You cannot separate the energy and the energetic. It is not possible. You cannot separate heat from fire. But fire is different from the heat. And heat is different from the fire. You are taking heat, that does not mean you are touching fire. Fire, in spite of expanding heat, it keeps its identity. Similarly,Kṛṣṇaby His different energies creating everything, He remainsKṛṣṇa. TheMāyāvādīphilosophers, they think, ""IfKṛṣṇais everything, then Kṛṣṇa's separate identity is not there."" That is material thinking. Just like drinking this milk, so little, little, when I finish, there is no more milk. It has gone to my belly.Kṛṣṇais not like that. Because He's omnipotent, we are utilizing His energy continually, but still He's there, present. Just like a man begetting children unlimitedly, but the man is there. Crude example. But not that because he has produced hundreds of children, therefore he is finished. So similarly, God orKṛṣṇa, in spite of His unlimited number of children, He's there.Pūrṇasyapūrṇamādāyapūrṇamevaavaśiṣyate[IsoInvocation].This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Kṛṣṇais never finished. [break] ...so powerful, therefore He is attractive. This is one side of the display of Kṛṣṇa's energies. Similarly, He has got unlimited energies. This study of Kṛṣṇa's energy is only one side, one portion only. So in this way if you go on studyingKṛṣṇa, that isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. It is not a bogus thing, that ""maybe,"" ""perhaps not."" Absolutely. It is."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:And the study itself is never finished.,Prabhupāda,No. How can you?Kṛṣṇahas unlimited energy. [break]
Bob:,"Bob:I've asked devotees about how they feel towards sex in their relations, and I under..., I see their way they feel, but I can't see myself acting the same way. See, I'll be getting married in this end of this summer.",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Bob:,"Bob:I'll be getting married the end of this summer, in September or August, when I return to America. And the devotees say that the householders only have sex to conceive a child. And I cannot picture myself at all in such a position, and... What kind of sex life can one lead, living in the material world?",Prabhupāda,"The Vedic principle is that one should avoid sex life altogether. The whole Vedic principle is to get liberation from this material bondage. And there are different attachments for this material enjoyment, out of which sex life is the source of topmost enjoyment. TheBhāgavatasays that this material world...Puṁsaḥstriyāmithunī-bhāvametam[SB5.5.8].Means that a man is attached to woman and woman is attached to man. Not only human society, in animal society also. That attachment is the basic principle of material life. So, a woman is hankering or seeking after the association of a man, and a man is hankering or seeking the association of a woman. Just like we see the, all the fictions, novels, dramas, this cinema, or even ordinary advertisement, simply they depict the attachment between man and woman. Even in tailor's shop you'll find on the window some woman, some man. [break] So this attachment is already there."
Bob:,Bob:The attachment between man and woman.,Prabhupāda,"Man and woman. So if you want to get liberation from this material world, then that attachment should be reduced to nil. Otherwise, simply for that attachment, you'll have to take birth and rebirth, either as human being or as demigod or as an animal, as a serpent, as a bird, as a beast. You have to take birth. So this basic principle of attachment, increasing, is not our business. It is decreasing.Pravṛttireṣābhūtānāṁnivṛttistumahā-phalam.This is the general tendency, but if one can reduce and stop it, that is first class. Therefore our Vedic system is that first of all a boy is trained as abrahmacārī,no sex life.Brahmacārī.He goes to the teacher's home. (pause—a devotee chantingHareKṛṣṇaover loudspeaker is very loud.) Who is this? Stop it. [break] The whole principle is, Vedic principle is, to reduce it, not to increase it. Therefore the whole system isvarṇāśrama-dharma.Our, the Indian system is calledvarṇaandāśrama,four spiritual orders and four social orders. The social order isbrahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,andsannyāsa.Uh, this is spiritual order. And social order isbrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,andśūdra.So under this system the regulative principles are so nice that even one has got the tendency for enjoy material life, he is so nicely molded that at last he gets liberation and goes back to home, back to Godhead. This is the process. So sex life is not required on principle, but because we are attached to that, therefore there are some regulative principles. Sex life... It is said in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamthat"
Bob:,Bob:What is that again?,Prabhupāda,"This attachment increases. The material attachment. The material attachment means ""I am this body, and because I have got this body in a particular place, that is my country."" And that is going on. ""I am American,"" ""I am Indian,"" ""I am German,"" ""I am this,"" ""I am that,"" this bodily... ""This is my country. I shall sacrifice everything for my country, society."" So in this way the illusion becomes increased. So under this illusion, when he dies he gets another body. That may be a superior body or inferior body according to hiskarma.So if he gets superior body, then that is also entanglement. Even if he goes to the heavenly planet, that is entanglement. And if he becomes cats and dogs, then his life's lost. A tree. There is every chance. So this science is not known in the world, that how the soul is transmigrating from one body to another and how he's being entrapped in different types of body. This science is unknown. Therefore whenArjunawas speaking from the bodily concept of life that ""If I kill my brother, if I kill my grandfather, the other side..."" So he was simply thinking on the basis of bodily concept of life. But when it was not solved he surrendered toKṛṣṇa, accepted Him as spiritual master. And whenKṛṣṇabecame his spiritual master He chastised him in the beginning.Aśocyānanvaśocastvaṁprajñā-vādāṁścabhāṣase[Bg.2.11],that ""You are talking like learned man, but you are a fool number one because you are talking on the bodily concept of life."" So this sex life increases the bodily concept of life. Therefore the whole process is to reduce it to nil."
Bob:,Bob:To reduce it over the stages of your life?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Reduce it, just like a boy is trained up as a student up to twenty-five years, restricting sex life.Brahmacārī.So, some of the boys they remainnaiṣṭhika-brahmacārī.He, because he's given education, so if he becomes fully conversant he doesn't like to marry. But one who has not such restraint, he's allowed to marry. That is also restricted, that he cannot have sex life without being married. Therefore in the human society there is marriage, not in the animal society. But we are reducing human society gradually to animal society. We are forgetting marriage. That is also written in theśāstras.Svīkāraevacodvāhe.In theKali-yugathere will be no marriage performances, but the boy and the girl, they'll simply agree to live together.Dāmpatye 'bhirucirhetuḥ.And their relationship will exist on sexual power. If the man or the woman is deficient in sex life, then there is divorce. So on this philosophy... There are many western philosophers like Freud and others. They have written so many books. But according to Vedic culture, we are not interested. We are interested only for begetting children. That's all. Not to study the psychology of sex life. There is already psychology,pravṛtti,natural. Even if one does not read any philosophy, he'll be sexually inclined. There is no need of philosophizing sex life. Nobody is taught sex life in the school and the colleges, but everyone knows it, how to do it. (laughs) Sopravṛttireṣābhūtānāṁnivṛttistumahā-phalam.That is the general tendency. But education should be given to stop it. That is real education. (pause)"
Bob:,"Bob:That, for today, is a radical concept, for nowadays.",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Bob:,"Bob:Presently, in America that's a radical concept.",Prabhupāda,"Well, in America there are so many things which requires thorough reformation. And thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is that. When I went to your country, so I saw these boys and girls, they're living like friends. I said that ""You cannot live as friends; you must get yourself married."""
Bob:,"Bob:Many people see that even marriage is not sacred. So they find no desire to... Because people get married, and if things are not proper they get divorced so very easy...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that also."
Bob:,Bob:...that some people feel to get married is not meaningful.,Prabhupāda,"No, the idea is that marriage is not sacred. They think marriage is a legalized prostitution. They think like that, but marriage is not that. Even that Christian paper, what is that, ""Watch...?"""
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Christian...""Watchtower?""",Prabhupāda,"""Watchtower."" It has criticized, one priest has allowed the marriage between man to man, homosex. So these things are going on. They take it purely for prostitution. That's all. So therefore people are thinking, ""What is the use of keeping a regular prostitution at a cost of heavy expenditure? Better not to have this."""
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:You use that example of the cow and the market?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, when the milk is available in the market, what is the use of keeping a cow? (laughter) It is a very abominable condition. In the western countries I have seen. Here also, in India, gradually it is coming to be so. (Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break] ...movement is especially meant for making human life, reaching the real goal."
Bob:,Bob:The real goal?,Prabhupāda,The real goal of life.
Bob:,Bob:Is the real goal of life to know God?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,"Bob:So that is the real goal, to know God.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Go back to home, back to Godhead. That is real goal of life. Just like the water coming from the sea as cloud falls down as rain and the actual goal is to flow down the river and again go to the sea. So we have come from God. Now we are embarrassed in this material life. Therefore the aim should be how to get out of this embarrassment and go back to home, back to Godhead. This is real goal of life."
Bob:,"Bob:But when you have some knowledge of God, then life is not so miserable.",Prabhupāda,"No, some knowledge will not do. You must have perfect knowledge.Janmakarmamedivyaṁyojānātitattvataḥ[Bg.4.9].Tattvataḥmeans perfect. That perfect knowledge is being taught in theBhagavad-gītā.So, we are giving chance to the human society to learnBhagavad-gītāas it is and make his life perfect. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. What your science says about the transmigration of the soul?"
Bob:,"Bob:I think that science cannot deny it, by scientific methods cannot deny it, or does scientific method show it. Science does not know of it.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore I say, imperfect science."
Bob:,"Bob:Science may, though, say something. It is said in science that energy is never destroyed. It is just changed.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right, but how the energy is working in future, that science does not know."
Bob:,Bob:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"How the energy is diverted, how by different manipulation the energy is working differently. Just like electric energy, by different handling it is creating heater and it is creating cooler. Just opposite. But the same electric energy. So similarly, these energies, living energy, how it is being directed, which way it is going, how it is fructifying in the next life, so they do not know. They do not know. And in theBhagavad-gītāit is very simplified.Vāsāṁsijīrṇāniyathāvihāya[Bg.2.22].You are covered by this dress, by this shirt. When this shirt is not workable you change it. Similarly, this body is just like shirt and coat, when it is no longer workable, we have to change."
Bob:,"Bob:What is the ""we"" that has to change? What is constant between one life to the next?",Prabhupāda,"That is soul. That is soul, ""I"", what you are speaking, ""you"", what I am speaking, identification,ātmā,or soul."
Bob:,Bob:My soul is different than your soul?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You are individual soul, I am individual soul."
Bob:,"Bob:But you have removed yourself from karmic influences. If I was to remove myself from karmic influences, would our souls be the same or different?",Prabhupāda,Soul is the same. Just like you are under certain conception of life at the present moment. Just like your these countrymen. They were under certain conception of life. But by training they have taken another conception of life. So the ultimate training is how to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. That is perfection.
Bob:,"Bob:If two people areKṛṣṇaconscious, is their soul the same?",Prabhupāda,Soul is always the same.
Bob:,Bob:In each person. In each person is it the same?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. [break] Soul, as spirit soul, pure soul, they are all equal. Even in animal. Therefore it is said,paṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18],means those who are actually learned, they do not see the outward covering, either human being or animal."
Bob:,"Bob:Oh, then they are all equal and the same, or just equal? Are they equal and the same, or are they just equal?",Prabhupāda,"No, equal and the same. Qualitatively and quantitatively."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:I thought there was also a difference.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Isn't there also individuality and difference?,Prabhupāda,Their individuality becomes different in accordance with the development of consciousness.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Oh. The soul before the development of consciousness...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So therefore, when one comes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then there is no difference. [break] Because their aim is at that time how to... [break] ...and that is nice."
Bob:,Bob:But they are the same because they are flowers.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:In that sense.,Prabhupāda,Same. That isacintya-bhedābhedaphilosophy. That everything is one and different simultaneously.
Bob:,"Bob:Now, if I may ask another question on this?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,"Bob:The soul may be, I have considered, somewhat a part of God. But my soul I do not feel, but at times I think I feel God. It's... I'm here maybe, and you may say God is here. If the soul is inside me, then should I be able to feel God inside me? Not all of God I mean, but a...",Prabhupāda,Part of God.
Bob:,"Bob:Yeah. Not to mean to say that I feel I am God, but to mean to say I feel that I am God...",Prabhupāda,(Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break]
Bob:,"Bob:I was asking Prabhupāda the meaning of the soul being part of God but I don't feel my soul, God in me. But God may be here, separate, separate from me. But should I be able to feel God inside me because my soul is a part of God?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, God is inside also."
Bob:,"Bob:If I could feel God inside me, then I should be able to understand transmigration, I would think.",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Bob:,Bob:If I could feel God inside me...,Prabhupāda,Yes...
Bob:,"Bob:...feel this soul, then I should be...",Prabhupāda,God is everywhere. God is inside and outside also. That is to be known.
Bob:,Bob:And how do you feel God inside you?,Prabhupāda,"That is, of course, not in the beginning. But you have to know it from theśāstrasby the Vedic information, as in theBhagavad-gītāit is said thatīśvaraḥsarva-bhūtānāṁhṛd-deśe'rjunatiṣṭhati[Bg.18.61].God is there in everyone's heart. In theBrahma-saṁhitāit is also said,aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayā...Not only in my heart, God is also within the atom. So this is the first information. And then, by yogic process you have to realize it."
Bob:,Bob:Yogic process.,Prabhupāda,Yes.Paramātmārealization.
Bob:,Bob:Is chantingHareKṛṣṇasuch a yogic process for realizing this?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is alsoyoga, yogic process."
Bob:,"Bob:What kind of yogic process must I do to find out, to feel this information, to feel the soul inside?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, there are many different yogic processes, but for this age this process is very nice."
Bob:,Bob:Chanting.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,"Bob:Through this I can feel not only God outside, but God inside?",Prabhupāda,"You understand everything of God. How God is inside how God is outside, how God is working—everything will be revealed.Sevonmukhehijihvādausvayamevasphuratyadaḥ[Brs. 1.2.234].By the service attitude God will reveal Himself. You cannot understand God by your endeavor. If God reveals. Just like when the sun is out of your sight you cannot see the sun by your torchlight or any light. Any amount of scientific method, you cannot see the sun at night. But in the morning you can see the sun automatically, without any torchlight. Similarly, you have to create a situation, you have to put yourself in a situation wherein God will reveal. Not that by your method you can ask God, ""Please come. I will see."" No, God is not your order carrier."
Bob:,"Bob:You must please God for Him to reveal, is that correct?",Prabhupāda,Yes.Sevonmukhehijihvādau.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:How do we know when God is pleased?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:How do we know when God is pleased, when we are pleasing God?",Prabhupāda,"When you see Him. (pause) Then you'll understand. Just like when you eat you needn't require to ask anybody whether you are feeling strength or your hunger is satisfied. If you eat, you understand that you are satisfied, you are feeling strength, you're feeling energy. It doesn't require to inquire anyone. Similarly, if actually, if you serve God, then you'll understand that ""God is dictating me. God is, I am seeing God."""
Brahmānanda,Or God's representative.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Brahmānanda,Or God's representative.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,Becomes easier.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Therefore you have to go through the God's representative.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādaḥ**.If you please God's representative, then automatically God becomes pleased. That is a... That you can directly see.Huh?"
Indian man:,Indian man:How to please God's representative?,Prabhupāda,"You have to carry out his order. That's all. God's representative isguru. So he's asking you to do this, to do that. If you do that, that is pleasing.Yasyāprasādānnagatiḥkuto 'pi.If you displease him, then you are nowhere. Therefore we worshipguru.Sākṣād-dharitvenasamasta-śāstrair uktastathābhāvyataevasadbhiḥ**.Agurushould be accepted as God. That is the injunction of allśāstras."
Bob:,Bob:Thegurushould be accepted as representative of God?,Prabhupāda,"Yes,guruis representative.Guruis the external manifestation ofKṛṣṇa."
Bob:,"Bob:But different than, like the incarnations ofKṛṣṇathat come?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,"Bob:In what way is the external manifestation of thegurudifferent than the external manifestation of, let us say,KṛṣṇaorCaitanyawhen They come to earth.",Prabhupāda,"Guruis one, representative ofKṛṣṇa. So there are symptoms who isguru. The general symptoms are described in theVedas.Tad-vijñānārthaṁgurumevābhigacchet, śrotriyaṁbrahma-niṣṭham[MU1.2.12].The first symptom isśrotriyam.Guruis in disciplic succession. One who has thoroughly heard about theVedasthrough his spiritual master. This is general description. So another description is in theBhāgavatam:"
Bob:,"Bob:LordCaitanya, He was not aguru, He was different thanguru?",Prabhupāda,He'sguru.
Bob:,"Bob:LordCaitanya, He was a different type ofguruthan you were?",Prabhupāda,"No, no.Gurucannot be different types. All gurus are of one type."
Bob:,"Bob:But He was, was He also an incarnation at the same...?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, He isKṛṣṇaHimself, but He is representing asguru."
Bob:,Bob:I see.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:And then.,Prabhupāda,"BecauseKṛṣṇa, as God, He demanded thatsarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].But people misunderstood Him. ThereforeKṛṣṇaagain came asguruand taught people how to surrender toKṛṣṇa."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Doesn't He say in theBhagavad-gītā,""I am the spiritual master""?",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Doesn'tKṛṣṇasay ""I am the spiritual master""? InBhagavad-gītāit says...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, He's the original spiritual master. Because He has accepted spiritual master ofArjuna. So what is the difficulty?Śiṣyaste'haṁśādhimāṁtvāṁprapannam[Bg.2.7].""I am your disciple."" So unless He's spiritual master, howArjunabecomes His disciple? He's the originalguru.Tenebrahmahṛdāādi-kavaye,in theBhāgavata.That He gave instruction aboutVedasin the heart ofBrahmā. So He'sguru."
Bob:,Bob:Kṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, He's the originalguru. Then His discipleBrahmāisguru. Then his discipleNāradaisguru. Then his discipleVyāsaisguru. In this way there isguru-paramparā.Evaṁparamparāprāptam[Bg.4.2],the transcendental knowledge is received through the disciplic succession."
Bob:,"Bob:So agurureceives his knowledge through the succession, not directly fromKṛṣṇa. Do you receive some knowledge directly fromKṛṣṇa?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, Kṛṣṇa's direct instruction is there,Bhagavad-gītā."
Bob:,"Bob:I see, but...",Prabhupāda,But you have to learn it through the disciplic succession; otherwise you'll misunderstand.
Bob:,Bob:But presently you do not receive information directly fromKṛṣṇa. It comes through the succession from the books?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. There is no difference. Suppose if I say that this is a pencil. And if you say to him, ""This is a pencil."" And he says to another man, ""This is a pencil."" Then what is the difference between his instruction and my instruction?"
Bob:,Bob:Kṛṣṇa's mercy allows you to know this now?,Prabhupāda,"No, Kṛṣṇa's mercy you can take also, provided it is delivered as it is. Now, just like we are instructing peopleBhagavad-gītā.TheBhagavad-gītāsays,Kṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].Now we are saying that ""You give up everything, just surrender toKṛṣṇa."" So therefore there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's instruction and our instruction. There is no deviation. So if you receive knowledge in that perfect way, then it is as god as receiving the instruction directly fromKṛṣṇa. But you don't change anything."
Bob:,"Bob:When I pray faithfully and reverently, doesKṛṣṇahear me?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:Directly?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:From me to Him?,Prabhupāda,"Because He's within your heart, He's always hearing you. When you are praying or not praying, you are doing some nonsense, He also hearing. And when you pray, that is very good, welcome. But even if you are doing some nonsense, He's hearing."
Bob:,Bob:Is praying louder than nonsense?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,"Bob:To Kṛṣṇa's ear, is praying louder than nonsense talk.",Prabhupāda,"No, He's all-perfect. He can hear any temper, or any degree of saying. Even if you don't speak, even if you simply think, He can hear you. As soon as you think that ""I shall do it,"" then He hears you.Sarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭaḥ[Bg.15.15]."
Bob:,"Bob:But one should pray, is that so? That one should...",Prabhupāda,That is his business.
Bob:,Bob:Excuse me?,Prabhupāda,That is his business.
Bob:,Bob:Listening?,Prabhupāda,Praying.
Bob:,Bob:Whose business? You mean...,Prabhupāda,Every living entity's. That is the only business.Ekobahūnāṁvidadhātikāmān.That is the statement of theVedas.
Bob:,Bob:What does that mean?,Prabhupāda,"He supplies everything. Everyone, actually He's supplying. He's supplying food to everyone. So He's father. So why should you not pray, ""Father, give me this""? Just like in Christian Bible there is, ""Father, give us our daily bread."" That is good, they are accepting the Supreme Father. But grown-up children, they should not ask from the father, but they should be prepared to serve the father. That isbhakti."
Bob:,Bob:My questions you solve so nicely. (Mild laughter),Prabhupāda,Thank you very much.
Bob:,"Bob:So, should I ask you another question now?",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes, yes."
Bob:,"Bob:I have read that we are influenced by the differentguṇas,passion, ignorance, ...[break]",Prabhupāda,(Speaks to someone is Bengali) [break]
Bob:,"Bob:I've read about there are threeguṇas,passion, ignorance, and goodness, in life. And I was wishing that you could explain this somewhat, especially what is meant by the mode of ignorance and the mode of goodness.",Prabhupāda,"Goodness means you can understand things. Knowledge. You can know that there is God, that this world is created by Him, and so on, so on, so many things, actual things. The sun is this, the moon is this, perfect knowledge. Even not perfect, he has got some knowledge. That is goodness. And passion means he identifies with this material body. And he tries to gratify his senses only. That is passion. And ignorance means animal life. He does not know what is God, how to become happy, ""why I am in this world."" Just like you are taking one animal to the slaughterhouse, it will go. But a man will protest. So this is ignorance. The goat, it is to be killed after five minutes, but if you give him a morsel of grass he's happy, he's eating. Just like a child. You are planning to kill her or kill him, he is happy, he's laughing, because innocent. That is ignorance."
Bob:,"Bob:This is... Being in these modes determines yourkarma,is that correct?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:Determines yourkarma.,Prabhupāda,"According to the association of the modes of nature your activities are being contaminated.Kāraṇaṁguṇa-saṅgo 'syasad-asad-yoni-janmasu[Bg.13.22].A man gets higher birth or lower birth according to the association of theguṇa,or the modes of nature."
Bob:,"Bob:So cheating and like that, what mode is that?",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,Bob:Cheating.,Prabhupāda,"Cheating is mixed up passion and ignorance. Just like one man cheats other. That means he wants to obtain something. He's passionate. But he commits some murder. He does not know that ""I'll have to suffer for it."" So it is a mixture of passion and ignorance."
Bob:,Bob:And what about when somebody helps another person?,Prabhupāda,That is goodness.
Bob:,"Bob:Why is that goodness? What intelligence is that? I mean, is,... This represents knowledge of what? You said that goodness is when you have knowledge, intelligence.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:So helping another person...,Prabhupāda,"That means he's ignorant, you're trying to enlighten him."
Bob:,Bob:So giving intelligence...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is goodness."
Bob:,"Bob:What about just giving assistance, like you give...?",Prabhupāda,That is also goodness.
Bob:,Bob:To a beggar who has nothing you give alms.,Prabhupāda,"Um hmm. So that is goodness. But still... Just like in your Bowery Street, they give some charity, and immediately he purchases one bottle of wine and drinks and lie down flat. (laughter) So that is charity... That is not goodness, that is ignorance."
Bob:,Bob:That charity is ignorance.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. There are three kinds of charities: goodness, passion, and ignorance. Goodness means charity where charitymustbe given. Just like thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. So if anyone gives charity to this movement, that is goodness. Because it is spreading God consciousness,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is goodness. And if one gives charity for some return, that is passion. And if somebody gives in charity, he does not know what he's going to do, just like the Bowery man, that is ignorance. So our Vedic principle is,Kṛṣṇasays, thatyatkaroṣiyajjuhoṣidadāsiyatkuruṣvamad-arpaṇam.That ""Give Me."" There is no question of knowing what is going to happen. IfKṛṣṇatakes, that is the perfection of charity. Or anyone who is representative ofKṛṣṇa, he takes, that is perfection."
Bob:,"Bob:And what kind of charity is it when you give to, food to somebody who is hungry?",Prabhupāda,"Well, that is also depends on goodness and passion and ignorance. That example I was giving, that a doctor has forbidden that ""This patient should not take any solid food."" But if you make charity, ""Oh, he..."" And he's asking ""Give me some solid..."" Sometime patient asks. And if you give him solid food, then you are not doing good to him. That is ignorance."
Bob:,"Bob:Are the devotees beyond accumulatingkarma?Have they... Does a devotee, these devotees, do they feelkarma?Do they work in these modes? Are they in the mode of goodness?",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,Bob:Are the devotees...,Prabhupāda,They are above goodness.Śuddha-sattva.Devotees are not in this material world. They're in the spiritual world. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.
Bob:,Bob:This is a devotee who practices very faithful...,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,Bob:A devotee who is very faithful reaches this stage?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Devotee, you can become devotee, as they have become. It is not difficult. Simply you have to engage yourself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That's all."
Bob:,Bob:I wish to gain more knowledge of God and be able to feel God's presence more. The reason for this is because I feel life has little meaning without this.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. If you miss this human form of life, then it is a great loss. This is a chance given to the living entity to get out of the entanglement of material existence."
Bob:,Bob:As I feel now...,Prabhupāda,(Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break]
Bob:,Bob:...thankful that I've been able to...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you can learn more and more."
Bob:,Bob:Now I still have my connections in home. Marriage is... I'm engaged and all this...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. There are so many marriages. He is married. Marriage is no barrier. I told you, there are four different orders of social life:brahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,andsannyāsa.So afterbrahmacārī,one can marry. But that is not obligatory. He may remainnaiṣṭhika-brahmacārīfor whole life. But abrahmacārīcan marry. So after marriage there isvānaprasthalife. Means little aloof from family. Live—husband and wife—separately. That time there is no sex life. And then, when he's fully renounced, detached from the family life, he takessannyāsa."
Bob:,Bob:Does somebody forget his wife completely then?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Forgetting is not very difficult if you try to forget. That's all. Out of sight, out of mind. (laughter) Just like I have got my wife, children, my grandchildren, everything. But out of sight, out of mind. That's all. Thereforevānaprastha,sannyāsa.Everything is nicely arranged by the Vedic system. [break] You are feeling warm?"
Bob:,Bob:Just tight.,Prabhupāda,Too tight.
Bob:,Bob:I was cold before. [break] (Loudspeaker in background is very loud) Thank you so much for allowing me to ask my questions.,Prabhupāda,"No, that is my mission, that people should understand the science of God. Because I am convinced that it's a fact. That without again cooperating with the Supreme Lord, our life is baffled. I give this example many times. Just like a screw from the machine fallen down, it has no value. The same screw, when it is again attached with the machine, it has value. Similarly, we are part and parcel of God. Without God, as part and parcel small screw, what is the value? No value. We should again come back to the position of becoming a screw. That is our mission."
Bob:,"Bob:I met a fellow today who came in the afternoon. Well, his reason for coming he said, you may find humorous, was to come..., he heard the hippies were in Māyāpura.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bob:,"Bob:He heard that hippie... [break] ...I was talking to him, and then some devotees were talking to him. And he had said some things to me which I could find no answer for. And he said he'll come back tomorrow to see devotees. But let me tell you. This is confusing. When he was young...",Prabhupāda,He's Indian?
Bob:,"Bob:Indian, Indian, lives nearby. He speaks English fairly well. When he was young, said he worshipedKālīevery day very vigorously. But then the floods all came, and the floods came, and the people saw hardship. But now he has no religion, and he says he finds his happiness in trying to develop love among people. And I couldn't think of what to say to him to add religion to his life, to add God to his life. He says, ""After the hereafter,"" he says, after he dies, ""so maybe I'll become part of God, maybe not,"" he says, but he can't worry about it now. He says he's tried this religious experience; it didn't work. And one reason I ask this is when I go back to America a lot of people I come across are like this. They see that religion, like his worship ofKālīor other kinds of religion that they've experienced doesn't work. And I don't know what to say to them to convince them that it's worth trying.",Prabhupāda,Hm. You do not try to convince him at the present moment. You try to be convinced yourself.
Bob:,"Bob:(laughs) Yes, yes. I did... I asked him to see devotees, but then on the way out as he was leaving down the road I met him again and talked, ""Come back,"" but... Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda,You first of all be convinced and then try to convince others.CaitanyaMahāprabhu's instruction is that you can do welfare for others when your life is success.
Bob:,"Bob:The devotees have said to me that without consciousness ofKṛṣṇaall the time, you cannot be happy. Without consciousness ofKṛṣṇayou cannot be happy. But at times I feel happy.",Prabhupāda,"At times, not always."
Bob:,Bob:Yes.,Prabhupāda,But if you beKṛṣṇaconscious you'll feel always happy.
Bob:,Bob:Oh. (laughter) They had implied that you cannot feel happy withoutKṛṣṇaconsciousness.,Prabhupāda,"That's fact. Just like if you are an animal of this land and if you are thrown into the water, you cannot be happy in the water in any condition. When you're again taken up to the land, then you'll be happy. Similarly, we are part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa. We cannot be happy without being part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa. Now we are thrown. The same example. The machine part and parcel without the machine has no value. But when it is put again into the machine it has value. Similarly, we are part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa; we must joinKṛṣṇa. So you can join immediately withKṛṣṇaby your consciousness. Simply thinking that ""I am Kṛṣṇa's, Kṛṣṇa's mine."" That's all."
Bob:,Bob:What is that...,Prabhupāda,"""Kṛṣṇa is mine."""
Bob:,"Bob:Mind, yes.",Prabhupāda,"""Mine. MyKṛṣṇa."""
Bob:,Bob:Ah.,Prabhupāda,"""Kṛṣṇa is mine,Kṛṣṇais mine, and I am Kṛṣṇa's."" That is our actual position."
Bob:,Bob:We are part ofKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Everything is part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa. Because everything is generated by the energy ofKṛṣṇa. And everything is energy ofKṛṣṇa. [break] ...tomorrow fasting.
Acyutānanda,Tomorrow we fast. Up until evening.,Prabhupāda,Up to evening.
Acyutānanda,Until the moon comes. Then we takeekādaśīor feast?,Prabhupāda,You can feast. Feast.
Bob:,"Bob:...the people coming and jumping on each other trying to get, afraid that theprasādamwould finish before they got served.",Prabhupāda,"No, assure them that we can... ""Don't be jumping. We shall supply you."" What can be done? [break] ...the place where we shall perform sacrifice, fire sacrifice, the tablet should be taken there and we shall worship. And then we place it."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:We'll carry the tablet.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:To the sacrifice place.,Prabhupāda,"We shall place the in... what is called, paraphernalia? And then begin. So ten feet deep and six feet wide. So you have ordered for bricks and cement? (loudspeaker in background very loud)"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:I was speaking with Mr. Sanyal and he also agreed that by having a man come here and make the bricks, we can save fifty percent.",Prabhupāda,"So try to find out. [break] You can talk. [break] (A devotee is speaking in Bengali over the loudspeaker and Prabhupāda mimics him, everyone laughs.) Mahāṁsa? Who is speaking, Mahāṁsa speaking or Bardon? [break]"
Indian man:,"Indian man:Śrīla Prabhupāda, I have one question. What is the purpose of service minus devotion?",Prabhupāda,Hmm? That is not service; that is business. (laughter) Just like we have employed some contractor. That is not service; that is business. Is it not?
Indian man:,Indian man:Certainly.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like sometimes they advertise: ""Our customers are our master."" Is it not? Sometimes advertise. So this is business, but it is a flowery language only that ""Our customers are our masters."" Because nobody is a qualified customer unless he pays. Hmm? But service is not like that. Service,CaitanyaMahāprabhusaid,āśliṣyavāpāda-ratāṁpinaṣṭumām[Cc.Antya20.47],""Oh, You do whatever You like; still, You are my worshipable Lord."" That is service. ""I don't ask any return from You."" That is service. When you expect some return that is business. (pause) Very nice road. [break]"
Bob:,"Bob:I wish to ask you to advise me on how I can come to feel closer to God. I'll be leaving you soon, and I'm... With you...",Prabhupāda,You have to purify.
Bob:,"Bob:Somewhat, but let me say I come to the temple at times and then I leave, and I'm not sure how much I take with me.",Prabhupāda,"It will not take much time. Within six months you'll realize. But you have to follow the regulative principles. Then it will be auspicious. Just like these boys and girls are doing. Just see the girl, how she's chanting always. All our girls is..."
Bob:,"Bob:Yeah, I've seen...",Prabhupāda,"They have no tendency for going to cinema or going to hotel, no. Everything all stopped.Anartha-nivṛttiḥ.Anarthameans unnecessary things, all rubbish."
Bob:,"Bob:I feel that when I go back, though...",Prabhupāda,"The whole human life is meant for purifying.Śuddhyedsattva.Sattvameans existence. So if you don't purify your existence, then you'll have to change your body, from this body to that. Sometimes it may be higher, sometimes lower. Just like, if you don't cure your disease, it can take turn in so many ways to put you into trouble. Similarly, if you don't purify your existence, then you'll have to transmigrate from one body to another. And there is no guarantee what kind of body you'll get. Very subtle laws of nature. Now there is no guarantee that you will get a very comfortable body or American body, no. Therefore for human being it is essential that he should purify his existence.Tapodivyaṁputrakāyenasattvaṁśuddhyed yasmādbrahma-saukhyaṁtvanantam[SB5.5.1].Unless you purify your existence, you're hankering after happiness, you cannot get continued happiness. That is not possible."
Bob:,"Bob:When I go, I go back to my job in New York, I hope I'll become purer, but I'm sure that I won't become as pure as your devotees here. I don't see myself doing that.",Prabhupāda,"You can do as they are doing. They were not pure in the beginning. Now they are pure. Similarly, you can become pure. Just like in your childhood age you were not educated; now you are educated."
Bob:,"Bob:So what are the things that I may do? See, if when I go back I must...",Prabhupāda,Where you go back?
Bob:,"Bob:I'll be going back to Chaibasa, Behar, and to my work there.",Prabhupāda,What is there in Chaibasa?
Bob:,Bob:That's where I do my teaching. I live there with...,Prabhupāda,So better do not teach. Because you do not know what to teach.
Bob:,"Bob:I have, I'm actually, I'll be going... I don't like this so much and I'll be returning to America in May. But while I'm here, this is my agreement to stay in India, that I...",Prabhupāda,"(Referring to microphone) It will not stay. No, if you are serious, you can keep yourself pure anywhere. It doesn't matter whether you stay in America or India. But you must know how to keep yourself purified. That's all."
Bob:,Bob:You mean by following these principles.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like I went to America. So either in America or in India, I am the same man."
Bob:,Bob:I have tried somewhat to follow since I met you the first time.,Prabhupāda,But follow... You must strictly follow if you are serious.
Bob:,"Bob:Maybe... O.K., maybe what I say now is the most foolish of all I've said, but let me tell you how I feel.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, not foolish. I don't say foolish. But imperfect."
Bob:,"Bob:O.K., imperfect. But let me tell you. I feel that right now I admire and respect your devotees, but I don't feel as if I'm part of them or even a great desire to be part of them. I feel that I just want to do what is right and come closer to God, and if I just go to a better life next time, I'd be satisfied.",Prabhupāda,Very good life.
Bob:,Bob:Maybe that's just material clinging.,Prabhupāda,"So just you follow in their footsteps, my other students, and it will be fulfilled, your desire. We are training to that direction, how to become purified and happy. That is our mission. We want to see everyone happy.Sarvesukhinobhavantu.But people do not know how to become happy. They do not take the standard path to become happy. They manufacture their own way. That is the difficulty.Tapodivyaṁputrakāyenaśuddhyedsattvayasmādbrahma-saukhyamanantam[SB5.5.1].This advice was given by Ṛṣabhadeva to his sons. ""My dear boys, just undergo austerity,""divyam,""for transcendental realization."" Everyone is going austerity. This boy, I know, he had to go foreign countries to learn this commercial management. So many... So now he's good situated. But everyone has to undergo some austerity for future life. So why not take that austerity for permanent happiness?Tapodivyaṁputrakāyenasatt...Permanent happiness, you have to purify your existential body. This body, so long you will accept this material body, you'll have to change it. And as soon as you get a spiritual body there is no question of change. Spiritual body you have already. Simply now, due to our material contamination, we are developing material body. But if we associate with spiritual life, then we shall develop spiritual body. The same example I have several times given, that you put the iron rod with fire, it will develop to be fire. Is it not?"
Bob:,Bob:Put the iron rod into fire...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, and it will become fire."
Bob:,Bob:Yes...,Prabhupāda,Although iron rod.
Bob:,Bob:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Similarly, this body, if you always keep yourself spiritually engaged, it will act as spiritual, although it is material body. The same example. Iron rod, when it is red hot, it is not longer iron rod, although it is iron rod. You can catch it as iron rod, but touch anywhere it will burn. It has got the quality of fire. Similarly, if you always keep yourself inKṛṣṇaconsciousness then you become spiritualized. You'll act spiritually. No more material demands."
Bob:,Bob:How do I do this?,Prabhupāda,"This process, as they are doing. You have seen. These boys are, our six boys, they are now initiated today. It is very simple. You have to follow the four restrictive regulations and chant this beads. Very easy."
Bob:,"Bob:Well, um, but... See, when I'm back in Bihar and following my lifestyle there, I..., if I follow all these regulative principles... Some I follow now, but not all... But if I follow all...",Prabhupāda,Some means?
Bob:,Bob:Some...,Prabhupāda,"There are only four regulative principles. Some means three, or two?"
Bob:,Bob:Two or three.,Prabhupāda,So why not other one?
Bob:,"Bob:No, no, I mean I follow one or two now. One or two now I follow.",Prabhupāda,(laughs) Why not the other three? What is the difficulty?
Bob:,Bob:Umm...,Prabhupāda,Which one you follow?
Bob:,"Bob:Which one I follow? I am almost vegetarian, but I eat eggs.",Prabhupāda,That is also not fully. (laughs)
Bob:,"Bob:No, not even fully. But since last time I've become vegetarian, and...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, vegetarian is no qualification."
Bob:,Bob:Not much.,Prabhupāda,"You see, vegetarian, the pigeon is vegetarian. The monkey is vegetarian. But most rubbish creature."
Bob:,Bob:Well...,Prabhupāda,"A monkey is vegetarian, nakedsannyāsī,lives in the forest, the most mischievous."
Bob:,"Bob:I felt that it was a little bit of progress because it was somewhat difficult at first, then easy, and I had returned to...",Prabhupāda,"No, you can stick to all regulative principles provided you take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness process. Otherwise it is not possible."
Bob:,"Bob:Yeah, but this is it. I have... When I'm back in Bihar and my friends may say... Well, we're sitting in the evening, and there's nothing to do but fight mosquitoes, and they'll say, ""How about smoking some marijuana?"" And I say, ""Sure, there's nothing else to do,"" and then I sit down and I enjoy myself for the evening. Now, we did this... we got carried away, we were doing it every day and realized we were hurting ourselves and stopped, but still, on occasion we do that....",Prabhupāda,"You have to live with us. Then your friends will not ask you, ""What about marijuana?"" (Bob laughs) Keep the association of devotees.Satāṁprasaṅgānmamavīrya-saṁvidobhavantihṛt-karṇa-ras...[SB3.25.25]. We are opening centers to give chance people to associate with us. Why we have taken so much land? Providing for those who are seriously desirous. They will come and live with us. Association is very influential.Satāṁprasaṅgāt.Saṅgātsañjāyatekāmaḥ.If you associate with drunkards, you become a drunkard. If you associate withsādhu,then you becomesādhu."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:He can come and stay with you in Bombay.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:He could come and stay in Bombay.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you can stay with us in Bombay. But here he wants friend, marijuana. That is the difficulty."
Bob:,"Bob:Um, let me ask you about something else. Then maybe I'll come back to this because I'm still... I find that I think of myself too much, and this way you can't think of God so much. One can't think of God. I think of myself in too many places. How can I forget about myself so I can concentrate on other more important things?",Prabhupāda,As they have done.
Bob:,Bob:(laughs) You are saying to me that my path... I think what you're saying is my path to purity is to become a devotee.,Prabhupāda,Do you hesitate?
Bob:,"Bob:Well, I...",Prabhupāda,It is very difficult to become a devotee?
Bob:,"Bob:For myself... It is... I don't feel so much the desire. I have... First the devotees tell me that they have given up material life. These four regulative principles, they have explained to me, means giving up material life, and that I see. And in place of this they have...",Prabhupāda,What do you mean by material life? I am sitting on this bed. Is it material or spiritual?
Bob:,Bob:Material.,Prabhupāda,Then how we give up material life?
Bob:,Bob:I think how I interpreted it was a desire for material gains.,Prabhupāda,That is material life.
Bob:,"Bob:You're working towards material gains, not giving up all material.",Prabhupāda,"Material life means when you desire to gratify your senses, that is material life. And when you desire to serve God, that is spiritual life. That is the difference between material life and spiritual life. Now we are trying to serve our senses. Instead of serving the senses, when we serve God, that is spiritual life. What is the difference between our activities and others' activities? We are using everything: table, chair, bed, this tape recorder, typewriter. So what is the difference? The difference is that we are using everything forKṛṣṇa."
Bob:,"Bob:This I see. The devotees have said that the sensual pleasures that they have given up are replaced with spiritual kinds of pleasures. But see, I haven't...",Prabhupāda,"Spiritual kinds of pleasure means when you desire to pleaseKṛṣṇa, that is spiritual pleasure. Just like example, a mother is more pleased by feeding her son. [break]"
Bob:,"Bob:Spiritual pleasure, then, is pleasing God.",Prabhupāda,Spiritual pleasure means pleasure ofKṛṣṇa.
Bob:,Bob:Pleasure ofKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And material pleasure means pleasure of senses. That's all. This is the difference. When you try simply to pleaseKṛṣṇa, that is spiritual pleasure."
Bob:,Bob:I had viewed this as... My thought of pleasing God was to do...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, don't manufacture your ways of pleasing God. Don't manufacture. Suppose if I want to please you, then I shall ask you, ""How can I serve you?"" Not that I manufacture service. That is not pleasing you. Suppose if I want a glass of water. And if you manufacture that ""Swamiji will be more pleased if I give him a glass of milk, hot milk,"" that will not please me. If you want to please me, then you should ask me, ""How can I please you?"" And what I order, if you do that, that will please me."
Bob:,"Bob:And pleasingKṛṣṇa, then, is being a devotee ofKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,The devotee means who is always pleasingKṛṣṇa. He has no other business. That is devotee.
Bob:,"Bob:Can you tell me some more about chantingHareKṛṣṇa? I have for quite some time chanted, but never regularly, just a little bit here and there. I just got beads very recently. And once in a while I feel comfortable chanting, and once in a while not comfortable at all. And maybe I don't chant properly. I don't know.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, everything has got process. You have to adopt the process."
Bob:,Bob:The devotees tell me of the ecstasy they feel when chanting.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is when... More you become purified, you feel ecstasy. But this chanting process is purifying process."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Śrīla Prabhupāda, this afternoon we were discussing about austerities.",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:About austerities. If you don't practice voluntarily austerities, then you must involuntarily practice some austerities.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, under the direction of spiritual master. You have no mind to follow austerities, but when you accept a spiritual master you have to carry out the order. That is austerity."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Even if you don't want to practice austerity, you must. You are forced to.",Prabhupāda,"No, because... You have got... You have surrendered to your spiritual master. His order is final. So even if you don't like, you have to do it. To please me. Even you don't like. Nobody likes to fast, but spiritual master says, ""Today is fasting,"" so what can be done? (laughter) This is austerity. And disciple means who has voluntarily agreed to be disciplined by the spiritual master. That is austerity. (Loudspeaker in background is very loud.)"
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Say, like our parents or many people in the material world, completely addicted to material life. They don't want to follow any austerities, uncomfortable, but still they must. By nature they're forced to austerities.",Prabhupāda,That is forced austerity; that is not good. Voluntary austerity will help.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:(indistinct) ...if you don't undergo voluntary austerity, you must be forced to undergo...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. (pause) That is the difference between man and animal. Animal cannot accept austerity. But man can accept austerity. That is the difference between. Just like there is a nice foodstuff in a confectioner's shop. So a man wants to eat it, but he sees that he has no money. So he can restrain. But an animal, cow comes, immediately he pushes his mouth in that. You can beat him with stick, it will tolerate, but it will do that. Therefore, animal cannot undergo austerity. (Someone else speaks inaudibly about volume of loudspeakers) Yes, yes, reduce. [break] Our austerity is very nice. We chantHareKṛṣṇa, dance, andKṛṣṇasends nice foodstuff, we eat. That's all. Why your people are not agreeable to such kind of austerities? Chanting, dancing, and eating nicely? (indistinct) I see austerity, call my mother."
Bob:,Bob:What is that?,Prabhupāda,"Suppose we have this nice foodstuff this mother has brought. So those who are not following austerities, they cannot expect. But because we are following austerity,Kṛṣṇasends us nice thing. So we are not loser. When you become Kṛṣṇized, then you'll get more comfort than at the present moment. That's a fact. I am living alone for the last twenty years, but I have no difficulty. When, before takingsannyāsa,I was living in Delhi, these boys were taking care of me. Yes. So I had no difficulty, although I was living alone."
Devotee:,"Devotee:If you don't accept a spiritual discipline, then nature forces so many...",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:We are so foolish that we are always thinking, ""In the future I'll be happy.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that ismāyā,illusion. That is an ass. You sit down on the back of the ass and just take a morsel of grass. He'll go. The ass is thinking, ""Let me go forward little, and I shall get the ass, er, grass."" But it is... One feet distant it always remains. That is ass-ism. (laughter) That is not... Everyone is thinking, ""Let me go a little forward, and I'll get it. [break] ...get it, be very happy."" [break]"
Bob:,Bob:I thank you so much for...,Prabhupāda,Hmm? [break] Don't talk l-e-a-v-e. But talk l-i-v-e.
Bob:,"Bob:I, I, I cannot yet, but I was thinking now of returning tomorrow to my town. But...",Prabhupāda,Don't return.
Bob:,"Bob:I should stay tomorrow, yes.",Prabhupāda,Stay here.
Bob:,"Bob:You tell me to, I'll stay.",Prabhupāda,Yes. You're a very good boy.
Bob:,Bob:O.K. Thank you. [break],Prabhupāda,"It is very simple. The living entities forgettingKṛṣṇa, they are in this material world.Kṛṣṇameans His name, His form, His abode, His pastimes, everything."
Bob:,Bob:What was that last?,Prabhupāda,Pastimes.
Bob:,Bob:Pastimes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like, when you speak of king, it means king's government, king's palace, king's queen, king's son, secretaries, military strength, everything. Is it not?"
Bob:,Bob:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Similarly,Kṛṣṇabeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as soon as we think ofKṛṣṇa(it) means all energies ofKṛṣṇa. That is complete by saying ""Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.""Rādhārepresents all the energy ofKṛṣṇa. AndKṛṣṇais the Supreme Lord. So when we speak ofKṛṣṇa, the living entities are also included. Because the living entities are energies, different energies ofKṛṣṇa, superior energy. So when this energy is not serving the energetic, that means material existence. The whole world is not servingKṛṣṇa. They are servingKṛṣṇain a different way. they are servingKṛṣṇaindirectly. Just like disobedient citizens, they serve the government indirectly. They have come to the prison house on account of their disobedience of the laws of the state. So in the prison house they're forced to obey the laws of the state. Similarly, all the living entities here, they're godless. Either by ignorance or by his will, he doesn't like to accept the supremacy of God. Demonic. So we are trying to bring them in their original condition. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. [break]"
Bob:,"Bob:I'd like to ask you just something I talked with devotees about, just medicine. I went to go, I walked to the river with some devotees today. I have a cold, so I said I shouldn't go in the water. Some felt I should because it is the Ganges, and some said I shouldn't because I have a cold. And we were talking, and I don't understand. Some... Devotees, do we get sick because of our bad actions in the past?",Prabhupāda,That's a fact.
Bob:,Bob:But when one is...,Prabhupāda,"Any kind of distress we suffer, it is due to our impious activities in the past."
Bob:,Bob:But when one is removed from karmic influence...,Prabhupāda,Yes?
Bob:,Bob:...does he still get sick?,Prabhupāda,"No. Even if he gets sick, that is very temporary. Just like this fan is moving. If you disconnect with the electric power, then the fan will move for a moment. That movement is not due to the electric current. That is force. What is called physically, this..."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Momentum.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Momentum.,Prabhupāda,"Momentum. But as soon as he stops, no more movement. Similarly, a devotee who has surrendered toKṛṣṇa, even he's found that he's suffering from material consequences, that is temporary. Therefore a devotee does not take any material miseries as misery. He takes as Kṛṣṇa's, God's, mercy."
Bob:,"Bob:But what about a perfected soul, a devotee, a pure devotee?",Prabhupāda,"Perfected soul means twenty-four hours engaged inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is perfection. Transcendental position. Perfection means to be engaged in his original consciousness. That is perfection. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,""Anyone who comes to Me, that is the...""Saṁsiddhiḥlabhateparam. Saṁsiddhi.Perfection, complete perfection.Saṁsiddhi.Siddhiandsaṁsiddhi.Siddhiis perfection. That isBrahmanrealization. Andsaṁsiddhimeans devotion, afterBrahmanrealization."
Bob:,Bob:Could you just say that last thing again please?,Prabhupāda,Saṁsiddhi.
Bob:,Bob:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Sammeans complete.
Bob:,Bob:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Andsiddhimeans perfection. So in theBhagavad-gītāit is stated that one who goes back to home, back to Godhead, he has attained the complete perfection. So perfection means when one realizes that he's not this body, he's spirit soul.Brahma-bhūta[SB4.30.20].That is calledBrahmanrealization. That is perfection. Andsaṁsiddhimeans afterBrahmanrealization, when one is engaged in devotional service. Therefore, one who is already engaged in devotional service, it is to be understood thatBrahmanrealization is there. Therefore it is calledsaṁsiddhi."
Bob:,"Bob:I, I, I ask you this very humbly, but do you feel diseases and sickness?",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Bob:,Bob:Do you personally feel disease and sickness?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:Is this a result of your pastkarma?,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Bob:,Bob:This is a result of your pastkarma?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bob:,Bob:So one in this material world never escapes hiskarmacompletely?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, escapes. No morekarma.For a devotee, no morekarmareaction."
Bob:,"Bob:But you must be the best devotee, and you...",Prabhupāda,"Hmm. No, I don't consider I am the best devotee. I am the lowest."
Bob:,Bob:No! No!,Prabhupāda,You are the best devotee.
Bob:,"Bob:(laughter) Oh, no! But see, you say, what you say..., it always, always seems right.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, but..."
Bob:,Bob:So then you must be the best devotee.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, the thing is that even the best devotee, when he preaches, he comes to the second-class devotee."
Bob:,Bob:What would the best devotee be doing?,Prabhupāda,The best devotee does not preach.
Bob:,Bob:What does he do?,Prabhupāda,"He sees there is no need of preaching; everyone is devotee. (Bob laughs) Yes. He sees no more nondevotee, all devotee."
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:Uttama-adhikārī?,Prabhupāda,"Uttama-adhikārī.But while I am preaching, how can I say I am the best devotee? Just like Rādhārāṇī. She does not see anyone nondevotee. Therefore we try to approach Rādhārāṇī."
Bob:,Bob:Who is this?,Prabhupāda,"Rādhārāṇī, Kṛṣṇa's consort."
Bob:,Bob:Ah.,Prabhupāda,"Anyone approaches Rādhārāṇī, She recommends toKṛṣṇa, ""Here is the best devotee. He's better than me."" AndKṛṣṇacannot refuse. That is best devotee. But it is not to be imitated, ""I have become best devotee. Therefore I have stopped."" That is... Actually, that is a different stage. So even the best devotee... Without (being) best devotee, he cannot preach actually,ācārya,but he comes to the second stage.Īśvaretad-adhīneṣubāliśeṣudviṣatsuca.He has the vision ofdviṣat,somebody envious of God. But it is not the vision of the best devotee. Best devotee sees, ""Nobody is envious to God. Everyone is better than me."" Just likeCaitanya-caritāmṛtaauthor,KṛṣṇadāsaKavirāja. He says that ""I am lowest than the worm in the stool."""
Bob:,Bob:Who was saying this?,Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇa... The author ofCaitanya-caritāmṛta,KṛṣṇadāsaKavirāja.Purīṣerakīṭahaitemuñiselaghiṣṭha[Cc.Ādi5.205].He's not making a show, he's feeling like that, that ""I am the lowest. Everyone is best, I am the lowest. Everyone is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, I am not engaged."" Just likeCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""Oh, I have not a pinch of devotion toKṛṣṇa. I cry to make a show. If I would have been a devotee ofKṛṣṇaI would have died long ago. I am living; that is the proof that I do not loveKṛṣṇa."" That is the vision of the best devotee. He's so much absorbed in Kṛṣṇa's love that he sees, ""Everything is going on; simply I am the lowest, therefore I cannot see God."" That is best devotee."
Bob:,Bob:So then a devotee must work for everybody's liberation?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. A devotee must work under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. Not imitate the best devotee."
Bob:,Bob:Excuse me?,Prabhupāda,Not imitate the best devotee.
Bob:,"Bob:Not, what is that word?",Prabhupāda,Imitate.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:...you said that sometimes you feel pain, some sickness, due to the sinful activities of your devotees. Is that... Couldn't sometimes disease be that, due to that? Caused by that?",Prabhupāda,"You see,Kṛṣṇasays thatahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi[Bg.18.66].So Kṛṣṇa's so powerful that He can immediately take up all the sins of others and immediately make it gone. But when a living entity plays the part on behalf ofKṛṣṇa, he also takes the responsibility of these sinful activities of his devotee. So to become aguruis not an easy task. You see? He has to take all the poisons and absorb. So sometimes, because he's notKṛṣṇa, so sometimes there is some trouble. ThereforeCaitanyaMahāprabhuforbidden that ""Don't make manyśiṣyas,many disciples."" But for preaching work we have to accept many disciples, for expanding preaching. Never mind we suffer. But that's a fact. The spiritual master has to take the responsibility of all the sinful activities of his disciples. So to make many disciple is a risky job unless he's able to assimilate all the sins. (pause) [break]...patitānāṁpāvanebhyo.He takes responsibility for all the fallen souls. That is... That idea is in Bible. Just like Jesus Christ take all the sinful reaction of all people and sacrificed his life. That is the responsibility of spiritual master. Because he's Kṛṣṇa's representative. SoKṛṣṇatakes all responsibility.KṛṣṇaisKṛṣṇa,apāpa-viddham.He cannot be attacked by any sinful reaction. But a living entity may be subjected sometimes, because he's small. Big fire, small fire. On a small fire if you put some big things, (chuckling) then the fire itself may be extinguished. In the big fire, whatever you put, that's all right. Finished. The big fire can consume anything."
Bob:,Bob:So Christ's suffering was of that nature?,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Bob:,Bob:Was Christ's suffering this...,Prabhupāda,"That I have already explained, that he took the sinful reaction of all the people, therefore he suffered."
Bob:,Bob:I see.,Prabhupāda,"He said... That is the Bible, that he has taken all the sinful reactions of the people and he sacrificed his life. But these Christian people, they have made it a law that ""Christ will suffer and we shall do all nonsense."" Such great fools they are. They are... ""Let Jesus Christ make contract for taking all one sinful reaction, and we will go on with all nonsense."" That is their religion. This... They are not in sense that ""Christ is so magnanimous that he took all our sins and he has suffered... We stop all these sins!"" They have not come to that sense. They have taking it very easily: ""Let Lord Jesus Christ suffer, and we do all nonsense."" Is it not?"
Bob:,Bob:It is so.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. They should have been ashamed that ""Lord Jesus Christ suffered for us. Instead of... We are continuing the sinful activities still. He asked everyone, 'Thou shall not kill,' and we are indulging in killing."" And ""Lord Jesus Christ will excuse us, take all the sinful reaction."" This is going on. [break] ...should be very much cautious that ""For my sinful actions my spiritual master will suffer. So I'll not commit a pinch of sinful action."" That is the duty of the disciple. After initiation his all sinful reaction is finished. Now if he again commits sinful activities, the spiritual master has to suffer. They should be sympathetic for this, that ""For my sinful activities my spiritual master will suffer."" [break] ...attacked with some disease it is due to the sinful activities of the disciples. Exactly like Lord Jesus Christ was crucified on account of the sinful activities of others. [break] ...forbidden, ""Don't make many disciples."" But we do because we are preaching. Never mind, let us suffer; still, we shall accept. [break]... question was that when I suffer it is due to my past misdeeds? Was it not?"
Bob:,"Bob:Yes, yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"That is my misdeed, that I accept a disciple who is nonsense. That is my misdeed."
Bob:,Bob:This happens on occasion?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, this is sure to happen because we are accepting so many men. But it is the duty of the disciple to be cautious. That ""My spiritual master saved me. I may not put him again into these sufferings."" [break] When the spiritual master is in suffering,Kṛṣṇasaves him.Kṛṣṇathinks, ""Oh, he has taken so much responsibility for delivering a fallen person."" SoKṛṣṇais there.Kaunteyapratijānīhinamebhaktaḥpraṇaśyati[Bg.9.31].Because the spiritual master takes the risk on account ofKṛṣṇa."
Bob:,Bob:So your suffering is not the same kind of pain that an impure person...,Prabhupāda,"No, it is not due tokarma.The pain is there sometimes so that the disciples may know that ""Due to our sinful activities my spiritual master is suffering."" [break]"
Bob:,Bob:...very well now.,Prabhupāda,"I'm always well. [break] ...well in this sense, even there is suffering, I knowKṛṣṇawill protect me. But this suffering is not due to my sinful activities. [break]"
Bob:,"Bob:But let us say, when I, in the town I live in I drink boiled water because some of the water has disease in it. Now, why should I drink boiled water? If I have been good enough not to get a disease, then I may drink any water. And if I have been not doing proper, then I shall get diseased...",Prabhupāda,So boiled water is any water also. Boiled water is included within any water.
Bob:,"Bob:But, you see, I drink that to prevent disease.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So long you are in the material world, what is physical laws, you cannot neglect that. Just like if you go to a jungle, there is tiger. It is known that it will attack you. Why should you voluntarily go and be attacked? It is not that a devotee should take physical risk so long he has got some physical body. It is not a challenge to the physical laws: ""Oh, I have become a devotee. I challenge everything."" That is foolishness.Anāsaktasyaviṣayānyathārham upayuñjataḥ.Viṣaya,these physical necessities, the devotee is advised to accept the necessities of life without any attachment. Physical law is take the boiled water, but if boiled water is not available, does it mean he'll not drink water? If it is not available, you drink ordinary water. [break] We takeKṛṣṇa-prasādam.But while in touring, in hotels sometimes we have to take some food in the hotel. Does it mean, ""Oh, I do not take any foodstuff from the hotel, I shall starve""? If I starve, then I'll be weak, I cannot preach. [break]"
Bob:,Bob:Does a devotee lose some of his individuality in that...,Prabhupāda,"No, he has got full individuality, but he sacrifices individuality for pleasingKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays, ""You surrender unto Me."" So he voluntarily surrenders. Not that he has lost his individuality. He keeps his individuality fully. But becauseKṛṣṇadesires that he should surrender, he never minds. He's individual. Just likeArjuna, in the beginning he was declining to fight on account of his individuality. But when he acceptedKṛṣṇaas his spiritual master, he becameśiṣya.Then whatever He ordered, ""Yes."" That doesn't mean he lost his individuality. He voluntarily accepted, ""WhateverKṛṣṇasays, I shall do it."" Just as all my disciples, they have not lost their individuality, but they have surrendered their individuality. That is required. Just like if a man does not use sex, does that mean he has become impotent? If he likes he can have, thousand times sex life, but he has voluntarily avoided it.Paraṁdṛṣṭvānivartate[Bg. 9.59].Sometimes we fast, that does mean we are diseased. We voluntarily fast. It does not mean that I am not hungry, I cannot eat. But we voluntarily fast."
Bob:,Bob:Does the devotee who surrenders keep his individual ...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, in full."
Bob:,Bob:...taste for different things?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Bob:,Bob:Does he keep his individual likes and dislikes?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, everything he keeps, but he gives preference toKṛṣṇa. Suppose I like this thing.Kṛṣṇasays, ""No. You cannot use it."" Then they are sacrificed. It is for Kṛṣṇa's sake.Nirbandhaḥkṛṣṇa-sambandhe."
Bob:,Bob:Let us say a devotee has a liking for one food over another food.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. But ifKṛṣṇadoes not like it, he won't take."
Bob:,Bob:And how does he know which foodKṛṣṇalikes him to take?,Prabhupāda,"That is stated in theśāstra.You have to know fromKṛṣṇa. When you... Just like, what kind of behavior government likes, how do you know it? From the lawbooks. Is it not? Similarly, whatKṛṣṇalikes and not likes, you get from theśāstra.You cannot manufacture the like and disliking ofKṛṣṇa. That is nonsense.Kṛṣṇasays,patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyaṁyo mebhaktyāprayacchati[Bg.9.26].He says definitely. Positively He says, that ""I like these things."" So we have to offer toKṛṣṇawhat He likes, and then we takeprasādam.Kṛṣṇalikes Rādhārāṇī. Therefore all thegopīs,they're trying to push Rādhārāṇī toKṛṣṇa.Nikuñja-yūnorati-keli-siddhyaiyāyālibhir yuktir apekṣaṇīyā **.That is expert. ""Oh,Kṛṣṇalikes thisgopī.All right, push her."" That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. To satisfy the senses ofKṛṣṇa. Not satisfy my senses. That isbhakti.That is calledprema,love forKṛṣṇa. ""Oh,Kṛṣṇalikes this. I must give Him this."""
Bob:,"Bob:There is, someprasādamis offered, and then we go and eat, and differentprasāda'sare served. And some I like, and some I find the taste not at all to my liking and do not eat.",Prabhupāda,"You should not do that. The perfection is whatever is offered toKṛṣṇa, you should accept everything. You cannot make, ""I like this. I do not like this."" That is perfection. So long you make such discrimination that means you have not appreciated what isprasāda.(pause)"
Devotee:,"Devotee:What if there is someone... This... (Static)... likes and dislikes. Say, someone is preparing someprasādam...",Prabhupāda,"No dislikings, no liking. WhateverKṛṣṇalikes, that's all right."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Yes. But say someone prepares something, like someprasādamforKṛṣṇa, but he does not make it so good, and it is...",Prabhupāda,"No, if you have made sincerely with devotion, thenKṛṣṇawill like it. Just likeVidura.Vidurawas feedingKṛṣṇabanana. So he was so absorbed in thought he was, I mean to say, throwing away the real banana and he was giving Him the skin, andKṛṣṇawas eating. (laughter) Because He knows that ""He's giving Me in the devotion."" SoKṛṣṇacan eat anything, provided there is devotion, real devotion. It does not matter whether it is materially tasteful or not. Similarly, a devotee also takeKṛṣṇaprasādam.Whether it is materially tasteful or not, he should accept everything."
Devotee:,Devotee:But the devotion is not there. Like in India...,Prabhupāda,"Devotion is not there, He does not like any food, either is tasteful or not tasteful. He does not accept it."
Devotee:,"Devotee:In India, somebody said...",Prabhupāda,"No India, of India, don't talk of India. Talk of the philosophy. If there is no devotion,Kṛṣṇadoes not accept anything, either in India or in your country. It is not... Kṛṣṇa's not obliged to accept anything costly because it is very tasteful.Kṛṣṇahas many tasteful dishes inVaikuṇṭha. He's not hankering after your food. He accepts your devotion. That out of...Bhaktyā,tadahamaśnāmi.Bhaktyāupahṛtam,real thing is devotion. Not the food.Kṛṣṇadoes not accept any food of this material world. But He accepts only the devotion.Patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyaṁyo mebhaktyāprayacchati[Bg.9.26],tadahamaśnāmibhaktyāupahṛtam.""Because it has been offered to Me with devotional love,"" that is required. One who has no devotional love, from his hand... Therefore we do not allow anyone to cook who is not a devotee.Kṛṣṇadoes not accept anything from the hands of a nondevotee. Why should He accept? He's not hungry. He does not require any food. He accepts only the devotion. That's all. That is the main point. So one has to become a devotee, not a good cooker. But if he's a devotee, then he'll be a good cook also.Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavatyaki&#241canāsarvair guṇaistatrasamāsatesurāḥ.Automatically he'll become a good cook. Therefore one has to become devotee only; then all other good qualification will automatically be there. And if he's a nondevotee, any good qualification has no value.Harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāmano-rathenāsati dhāvatobahiḥ[SB5.18.12].He's on the mental plane. So he has no good qualification. [break] The time?"
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Six o'clock. Twenty more minutes, twenty minutes. [break]",Prabhupāda,"It is... Question and Answer, it is required. It is beneficial to all the..."
Bob:,Bob:I still have question on theprasāda.,Prabhupāda,"SūtaGosvāmī says,munayaḥsādhupṛṣṭo 'haṁ bhavadbhirloka-maṅgalam,kṛṣṇa-sampraśnaḥ[SB1.2.5].Kṛṣṇa-sampraśnaḥis very good. When you discuss and hear, that isloka-maṅgalam,either by the question or by the answer."
Bob:,"Bob:I still have..., do not understand so much about what you're telling me about theprasādam.But if you like I'll think about it and ask, ask you again tomorrow. Aboutprasādam.",Prabhupāda,"Prasādamis alwaysprasādam.So because we are not elevated sufficiently, therefore we do not like someprasādam."
Bob:,"Bob:I found, specifically what I mean, is some was too spicy and hurt my stomach.",Prabhupāda,"Well, that is also due to ... not appreciate. ButKṛṣṇashould be... The cook should have consideration thatKṛṣṇamust be offered first-class foodstuff. So if he offers something last class, that is not his duty. ButKṛṣṇacan accept anything if it is offered by a devotee, and a devotee also can accept anyprasādam,even if it is spicy. [break] Hiraṇyakaśipu gave his son poison and he drank it nectarine. So for the devotee even it is spicy to other taste, it is very palatable to the devotee. What is the question of spicy? He was offered poison, real poison. [break] ...she also offeredKṛṣṇapoison, but Kṛṣṇa's so nice that ""She took Me as My mother."" So He took the poison and delivered her.Kṛṣṇadoes not take the bad side. Any good man, he does not take the bad side; he takes only the good side. [break] He wanted to make business with myGuruMahārāja. But he did not take the bad side. He took the good side that ""He has come forward to give me some service. So whatever he wanted he gave him."""
Bob:,"Bob:Business with you, what was that? Business with who?",Prabhupāda,"That is, I am talking about myGuruMahārāja."
Bob:,"Bob:Oh, oh, I see. [break] ...question onprasādam,if I may. Let us say if some devotee has some trouble and does not eat a certain type of food. Like some devotees do not eat ghee because of liver trouble. So these devotees, should they take all theprasādam?",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. I say those who are not perfect devotee, they may discriminate. But a perfect devotee does not discriminate. So why should you imitate a perfect devotee? So long you have discrimination, you are not a perfect devotee. So artificially why should you imitate a perfect devotee and eat everything?"
Bob:,Bob:Oh-h.,Prabhupāda,"The point is, a perfect devotee does not make any discrimination. Whatever is offered toKṛṣṇa, it is nectar. That's all. Just like exactlyKṛṣṇaaccepts anything from a devotee. ""Whatever is offered to Me by My devotee,"" He accepts. The same thing for a devotee. [break] ...point?"
Bob:,Bob:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"The perfect devotee does not make any discrimination. But if I am not a perfect devotee, I have got discrimination, why shall I imitate a perfect devotee? That will not be possible to assimilate or digest. Because I am not a perfect devotee. These things are... A devotee should not be a foolish man.
