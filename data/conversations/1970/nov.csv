Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:""Patel Pola(?) of Chicago had observed that he was a construction worker doing aśūdra'swork. It would not become necessary to allot the three lower castes to the foreign converts according to their professions. This will not be an easy task. Talking of profession reminds me of a still graver problem—that of the occupation or profession of the whitesādhus.If I am not mistaken, theKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement would turn out legions of new whitesādhusin the West whose only aim in life would be to propitiate their LordKṛṣṇa. They would be steeped in thebhakti-rasaand would not soil their hands with doing any work for such a mundane thing as earning a living.""",Prabhupāda,They are not doing anything. Actually they are not doing anything. They are preaching only.
Guest (1) (Indian man):,"Guest (1) (Indian man):No, but he says that legions ofsādhus,such white men, persons from West, becomesādhus,then who will do this job of earning a living?",Prabhupāda,"Why he is crying? If he is hungry, let him come here. We shall provide him. Why he is crying for that? What business he has got to cry, ""What will they do?"" What they will, that they know. Why he is crying? What is his business for crying for this future? If he is hungry, let him come and we shall provide him. This is not... That is a childish conception. ""If everybody becomessādhu,then what will be the nature of the society?"" That is, never becomes. That never becomes. To becomesādhuand to become aVaiṣṇavais not so easy thing. These idle questions, why they publish? I do not know. This is idle question. It never becomes. LordKṛṣṇapersonally says that ""You simply surrender unto Me."" How many have surrendered till now? LordKṛṣṇasays in theBhagavad-gītāthat ""You give up everything and surrender unto Me."" So how many have done that? So this is a rascal question, ""If everyone surrenders, then what will happen to the world?"" But that will never happen. It is very difficult to surrender. That he does not know. (Hindi) It is not expected that everyone becomesādhu.To becomesādhuis not so easy thing, especially this nature ofsādhu,pure. How many are there? We have given the prescription that ""Give up this, give up this."" How many have given up this? So that is not possible, but still, these nonsense questions are raised."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Should I go on?,Prabhupāda,Hm.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:""As in India, so in the West...""",Prabhupāda,"This class of question is answered..., no, criticized... (Hindi) There was a big market, because in the village there ishaṭṭaevery weekly. So in the village one old woman, she saw, ""Oh, how I shall provide all these men at night? Where they will sleep? So many guests has come. What can I do?"" She began to cry. So her son said, ""Mother, you don't bother. They will go away."" ""No, no. How can I provide?"" So in the evening he brought the mother: ""Now see."" So when she saw that, nobody is there. Theoretically, she began to cry, ""Where shall I provide all, so many guests?"" And this class of question is like that. Simply on theoretical they are asking."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:It goes on.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:""As in India, so in the West thesādhuswill have to live on alms given by others and will have to forego many of...""",Prabhupāda,"He does not know what issādhu.He is notsādhu.He isgṛhastha.I have got many professors, engineers. So they areKṛṣṇa-bhaktas. Are they notsādhus?The rascal does not know; thatsādhumeans beggar, he knows.Arjunabecame asādhu.He was a beggar? So he does not know what issādhu. Sadhu'sdescription is given,bhajatemāmananya..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):This particular letter is written by a woman. It is unnecessarily pushing the...,Prabhupāda,"So it should be replied properly, that ""You do not know what issādhu. You do not know what isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Why do you bother yourself?"" Just like one, this Jain paper has published that ""Swami Bhaktivedantaji says that 'Kṛṣṇa is everything; Hinduism is nothing.' "" So anyone who saysKṛṣṇais everything, he is notHindu. Just see. Such foolishness. Go on."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:So... ""Thesādhuswill have to live on alms given by others and will have to forego many of their luxurious personal needs. The coming years are therefore going to create for UncleSama national problem of magnitude...""",Prabhupāda,"You, already problem."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:""...the like of which he has not seen before.""",Prabhupāda,What...? What they are doing for the hippies? In U.S.A. they have thousands of hippies. They are doing nothing. That problem is already there. Go on.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:""It will create a national problem of a magnitude the like of which he has not seen before. In fact, Western society is in for a great jolt. A.KarimSaikh.(?)"" Then two more letters.",Prabhupāda,But the old woman's crying.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:Do you want to hear the next letter? This is the second letter. ""I do not see why you devoted two full pages to the article on 'HareKṛṣṇa,HareKṛṣṇa,' November 8th. Wearing a plain whitesari, applying sandal paste on the forehead and wearing nose-rings do not transform one. Churning milkgopīfashion is no way to attain spiritual bliss. The statements made by the devotees of theHareKṛṣṇamovement reflect an attitude of escapism.""",Prabhupāda,"Hm. Anyway, we are getting publicity."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:(laughs) They're angry. ""How can the chanting ofHareKṛṣṇapurify the mind? It only closes it to everything else. Purity of the mind lies in knowing all evil and yet abstaining from it. The escapist attitude of the devotees of the movement is reflected in the reply ofAdhikārīwhen he bypasses the question of India's poverty by giving irrelevant answers. The poverty of our country is known to all of us. I am not an atheist, but I find it difficult to digest the sentimentalism in the article.""",Prabhupāda,What is that sentimentalism?
Guest (1):,Guest (1):This is Times of India.,Prabhupāda,Bombay.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Yes. I think in Bombay there was a large article.,Prabhupāda,What about? Favorable or unfavorable?
Revatīnandan:,Revatīnandan:The magazine section. Two page particle with nice pictures. You liked it very much.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, oh, yes, yes. I remember. She is envious, that ""Why two page advertisement, publicity has been..."" That's all. Now, now, we have to serve the political, politicians. Eh? Because they cannot do, so they are asking us."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:To do.,Prabhupāda,"Such a nonsense. So we have to help these rascal politicians. You write that, that ""Do you mean to say thatKṛṣṇaconsciousness means business is to serve the rascal politicians? We are going every country and when we find time we shall go to Pakistan."""
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Not for vacating the aggression, but for...",Prabhupāda,"""Not for helping the politicians who are very much eager to join Pakistan. Our joining is different. Even in India we have got so many enemies like you who are criticizingKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. So there are rascals everywhere, either in Pakistan or India. So we are not satisfy the rascals. We are meant for intelligent persons."" Write that, like that."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):(Hindi),Prabhupāda,Yes? Then? Who is it? Anything more?
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:I think that's it. [break],Prabhupāda,But we have to do in such a way that I may not be in inconvenience. Take something. All right. Bring something; take one piece. That's all. Finished. You were drinking before?
Devotee:,"Devotee:Yes, I was...",Prabhupāda,So you don't feel any inconvenience?
Devotee:,Devotee:No.,Prabhupāda,That's nice. You were smoking also?
Devotee:,Devotee:No.,Prabhupāda,"That's nice. Our students, they have very quickly given up the four principles of sinful activity. And that is actually surprising to all these so-calledsannyāsīsalso. They are surprised. They cannot give up tea-drinking, smoking. Still, they are passing on as spiritually advanced. They are still servant of smoking and tea and they have become God. Just see the fun. ""Nārāyaṇa."" They address one another, ""Nārāyaṇa. (laughter) You areNārāyaṇa. I amNārāyaṇa. There is no trouble because you areNārāyaṇa."" So begin. [break] Others not, your father."
Child:,Child:My grandfather.,Prabhupāda,Soaśakti...?(end) These are also done within these five years.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Yes, it's a wonderful thing. I was all the while imagining, imagining...",Prabhupāda,"So I went in U.S.A. without any sponsor. No, I... That is the... One gentleman sponsored for one month, one month only. Not even one month. I remained there only three weeks, and then I chalked out my plan. He was my friend's son, and my friend wrote him that ""You sponsor Swamiji for one month."""
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Some American gentleman?,Prabhupāda,"No, Indian, one gentleman fromAgra. So his son immediately sent me, sponsoring. But still, the government objected that ""We cannot allow you to go there because you are sponsored by an individual person."" But I wanted to see chief controller of, what is called, foreign exchange, Mr. Rao. So he kindly accepted. ""Yes, Swamiji, you can go."" He fought. (?)"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):That time it was very difficult. Passport I have got already.,Prabhupāda,"Passport,visa."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Now, the difficulty is aboutvisaonly. Passport I have secured. He's cleared it for three years. Now it is easy to get a passport. I do possess. After getting the passport I wrote and corresponded with...",Prabhupāda,"So there was no money with me and in an awkward position... My philosophy is completely different. I was to ask them to cease from four kinds of sinful activities, and they are habituated to these things. Illicit sex, and drinking, wine and intoxication and gambling—these are their daily affairs. So I was thinking, ""I have to stop this. Who will hear me?"" ButKṛṣṇa... Everything became..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):May I ask one thing. How you chose this America to be your first...?,Prabhupāda,"MyGuruMahārājaordered me that ""You go and preach this cult amongst the English speaking public and specially in the western countries."" So first of all I thought of London, where is London, but I had no money. So I got the opportunity for going U.S.A. free on the, on a trade ship by the Scindia Steam Navigation. They gave me their first-class cabinet, the proprietor's cabinet. I was well carried. But first of all I went free on a steamship. I had no money, what to speak of aeroplane. So... What was your question?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):My question was that how you selected America to be your...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So I got the opportunity to go to America because their ship goes to New York. So I accepted, ""All right, we can see, either go to London or New York."" New York is better place than London."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):There are number of Indians in New York. In New York, Indians are...",Prabhupāda,No. In London there are many Indians.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):In London, they say, there are about twelve lakhs of Indians in London.",Prabhupāda,Yes. There are many Indians. In the street you will find it is just like ordinary Indian city. (Hindi)
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):We both are coming from Horir(?), leaving Delhi after... We are interested in thisGītā-jayantīMahotsava,and we shall be more interested in you also. You are coming...",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):So this is (?) Kumar Sharma. He's an, a learned(?) man. He has brought this tape recorder. He has come to tape your interview. Last night we met Mr.Ja.(?)",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):And he has permitted us to take your interview for our paper. So if you don't mind we shall ask some questions.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):And we'll finished before you go there.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. No, my men will go. Even if I am a little late, it doesn't matter. So you go there and join at night. Then I will come in."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):(inaudible)... America from the last five, six years back and incorporated thisKṛṣṇaconscious movement there. That means to say that it isKṛṣṇaalone, it isbhaktiofKṛṣṇaalone through which you can have God realization, andKṛṣṇaalone...",Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇais God. People are searching—""Where is God?""—but they are missingKṛṣṇa. That is the dilemma of the present society."
Guest (5):,Guest (5):Will they be answering in Hindi or English?,Prabhupāda,Which one?
Guest (5):,Guest (5):This gentleman. You'll be answering in Hindi or English?,Prabhupāda,As you like.
Guest (5):,Guest (5):They know Hindi.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Guest (7):,"Guest (7):No, no. If you want to put questions in English, Swamiji will reply in English. If you want to put in Hindi, I hope... Yesterday I heard him in Hindi, I had the good fortune, and I can say with my understanding that he is equally past master in Hindi ...(laughter) Yesterday we had the good occasion and the good fortune of hearing him in Hindi as well. Disciples will speak English only.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, they do not speak."
Guest (8):,Guest (8):They probably don't know Hindi.,Prabhupāda,No.
Guest (6):,Guest (6):(Hindi),Prabhupāda,"(Hindi) I was born aVaiṣṇavafamily. My father was a great devotee. Naturally, he led me... Oh, I am speaking in Hindi, English. (Hindi) They are not attracted to theHindudharma."
Guest (6):,"Guest (6):Then why they attracted toHareRāma,HareKṛṣṇa?",Prabhupāda,"They are attracted toKṛṣṇa. These people, they are... (Hindi) But you are takingKṛṣṇaasHindu. That is your mistake.Kṛṣṇais...Hindune.He is God. He is God. GodHindune,Mussulmanne,Christianne,Parsine—God is God. (Hindi) And I am also not interested to preachHindudharma.(Hindi) ...Kṛṣṇadharma.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, that is the onlydharma.(Hindi) ...Kṛṣṇaliterature. It is not aHindudharmaliterature. (Hindi)"
Guest (4):,Guest (4):But then why theVedasallow us to eat the meat of goat and other animals?,Prabhupāda,"That is to restrict. Just like government opens liquor shop. That does not mean government is encouraging to drink. Those who are drunkard, going create disturbance, for them there is little concession, but they are responsible. If they become drunkard and causes some disturbance in the street, then he will be arrested by the police. He cannot say, ""Oh, I have paid for the bottle."" (Hindi) Thebhaktiis all-inclusive. (ExplainsBrahman,Paramātmā,Bhagavānin Hindi)Brahmā-jñānameans, just like sunlight. You understand sunlight. That does not mean that you know sun disc. But both of them are light."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):TheBrahma-jñānahas got a limited jurisdiction.,Prabhupāda,It is these things that... This is the... just like ordinary...(Hindi)Yasyaprabhāprabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣvaśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnamtadbrahmaniṣkalamanantamaśeṣabhūtaṁ...[Bs.5.40]. (Hindi)
Guest (9):,Guest (9):Different stages? Are there different stages?,Prabhupāda,Different features. Just like Sūryaloka or Sūryadeva orSūrya-raśmi. (Hindi)
Guest (9):,Guest (9):I see.,Prabhupāda,(Hindi) Different stages. (Hindi)
Guest (9):,Guest (9):You have to try to come in secondarya. (?),Prabhupāda,"Then second,paramātmā-jñāna.Thenbhagavad-jñāna."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):(Hindi),Prabhupāda,"(Hindi) That is the purebhakti.(Hindi) my family, my...so many responsibility, (Hindi)."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):It is very difficult to give up.,Prabhupāda,"It is difficult, but there is way."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):There is some ceremony for that.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So this isupādhi.(Hindi) I identify myself asHindu, yes. Then they would not have accepted. They would have said, ""We have got Christianity. Why should I accept your Hinduism?"" (Hindi)"
Guest (9):,"Guest (9):This sort of distinction was not clear to us, but now, after hearing you this morning...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (9):,Guest (9):...and your ceremony...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now, if you go anywhere, if you want to preach Hinduism, why they should be interested in Hinduism? They can hear some words. But we are not talking of Hinduism and Mohammedanism; we are talking on the science of God."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):The true philosophy.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. What is God? What is the conception of God? Oh, they have accepted, therefore: ""Yes, here it is right conception."" Yes."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):Go back to Godhead.,Prabhupāda,Back to Godhead.
Guest (9):,Guest (9):I distributed what I got.,Prabhupāda,"No, I shall arrange to distribute. I am getting fifty thousandBack to Godheads.Fifty thousand. I shall distribute. [break] ...(Hindi) We haven't got to presentKṛṣṇaas Indian orHindu.Kṛṣṇais neither of them.Kṛṣṇasays, claims, that ""Every living entity is My part and parcel. I am the seed-giving father."" So therefore it has become successful. I never said that ""You become aHindu."" ""You acceptKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and try to understand the philosophy."" What business they have got to becomeHindu? But they want to know what is God. Oh, that we have been confident."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):They are accepting God.,Prabhupāda,Yes. (Hindi) Even if they are puzzled. AlthoughKṛṣṇaappeared in India.
Guest (9):,Guest (9):We don't think that He belongs to particular place or...,Prabhupāda,"That's... They do not understandKṛṣṇa. (Hindi) Why step by step? If you have to acceptKṛṣṇa, why not immediately? That is intelligence."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):But you should be...,Prabhupāda,"There is no question of ""should be."" WhenKṛṣṇasays, ""I'll give you protection,"" why ""should be""? You don't believe inKṛṣṇa. He says,ahaṁtvaṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣa[Bg.18.66].You are doubtful about Kṛṣṇa's capacity. That means you do not knowKṛṣṇa. Yes."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):But in a part of one form...,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):He means that is beyond his capacity, to understand Him.",Prabhupāda,"What is the difficulty?Kṛṣṇasays, ""I am everything."" Why don't you accept Him? That means you want to understandKṛṣṇain your own way. Why you are becoming intentionally unable?"
Guest (9):,"Guest (9):No, believe Him as a you are a servant and serve Him. Or you believe that you are mother to Him.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is second. First of all surrender. Then what way you shall surrender, that is different thing, another stage, more confidential. First of all there is surrender. First of all you enter this house or this room. Then you ask, ""How can I serve you?"" That is different. First of all there is no surrender, or without surrender, full surrender, there is no entrance inKṛṣṇa. No entry. Because those who revolted againstKṛṣṇa, those who wanted to becomeKṛṣṇaby imitating Him, they are here in this material world.Icchā-dveṣa-samutthenasargeyāntiparantapa[Bg.7.27].(Hindi)Bhūtvābhūtvāpralīyate[Bg.8.19],creation, that all the living entities who have come into this created world, they have revolted. They wanted to becomeKṛṣṇa, to imitateKṛṣṇa. Therefore they have given the chance, ""All right, you becomeKṛṣṇa. You do whatever you like. I will give you facilities. You want to becomeBrahmā? All right, you becomeBrahmā. And you want to become the worm of stool? I will give you the facility."" So these living entities are rotating. Sometimes he is becomingBrahmā, sometimes becoming the worm of stool, sometimes this, sometimes that. In this way he is changing body. This is material world. Or when he comes back again, back to Godhead,yadgatvānanivartantetaddhāmaparamaṁmama[Bg.15.6].Then you'll haven't got to come back.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmetikaunteya[Bg.4.9]. So we have to prepare for that position, how to go back to home, how to go back toKṛṣṇaand engage ourself in His service. Then the question of either as mother or friend or... That will be considered later on. First of all let us try how to enter kingdom of God. That is condition,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁ[Bg.18.66],that ""You surrender unto Me fully, giving up all your other engagements. Then I take charge of you.""Ahaṁtvāṁmokṣayiṣyāmi.Mokṣais there. For aKṛṣṇa-bhaktais nothing,mokṣa,or liberation. He'll do it. He'll look after it."
Guest (9):,Guest (9):Thank you.,Prabhupāda,Ready? All right. (end)
