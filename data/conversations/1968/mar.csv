Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Your Grace, what is the basis of your teachings?",Prabhupāda,"The basis of this teaching isBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.I have already published my book, thisBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.This book is not new. It is very old book, at least five thousand years old, and it is very widely read all over the world. In your country I have seen there are about more than twenty-five different editions, English. Similarly, there is in German language, in England, inJapan. Everywhere, all over the country this book is very widely known,Bhagavad-gītā.In other words, this isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. The speaker of this book is LordKṛṣṇa, and the subject matter of this book is what is our relationship with God. Then, after understanding what is our relationship with God, we can work accordingly. Just like you are citizen of America, you have got a particular relationship with the state, and you are expected to work according to that relationship, and then you are good citizen, you are law-abiding citizen, and state gives your all protection, and you can improve to the highest perfectional stage. Similarly, if we know our relationship with God, whom we callKṛṣṇa...Kṛṣṇameans all-attractive, and that is the perfect name of God. Unless God is all-attractive, he cannot be God. God cannot be Hindus' God or Christians' God or Jews' God or Mohammedans' God. No. God is for everyone, and He is all-attractive. He is fully opulent. He is fully in knowledge, perfect in knowledge, perfect in beauty, perfect in renunciation, perfect in fame, perfect in strength. In this way He is all attractive. So we must know our relationship with God. That is the first subject matter of this book,Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is.Then if we understand our relationship, we can act accordingly. At the present moment we are, some of us declining God. ""There is no God."" Some of them have little conception of God, ""God is great,"" but they do not try to understand what is actual relationship with God. They are not very serious. In this way, practically we are avoiding our eternal relationship with God, and therefore we cannot act properly, and that is the cause of all miseries. That is the cause of all problems. Just like if you do not know the state laws, then you do not act properly. You are always criminal. For example, if you do not know how to drive, ""keep to the right,"" if you drive to the left, you may think, ""Oh, it is after all driving. What does it matter, right or left?"" But no. As soon as you drive left, you become criminal. Similarly, because we do not know our relationship with God, therefore we are acting wrongly, and therefore, under the laws of God, we are becoming more and more criminal and our problems are increasing. Therefore, in spite of advancement of education, science, civilization, a nice dress, car, and everything, nobody trusts nobody. You see? Everywhere you go, a gentleman's house, oh, ""Beware of the dog,"" ""No trespasser allowed."" Always suspicious. An individual person is suspicious of another individual person. A nation is suspicious of another nation. A community is suspicious of another community. So how can you have peace and prosperity? Suspiciousness means animal, animalistic. A dog is suspicious of another dog. As soon as it finds another dog, immediately begins to bark."" Row! Row! Row!"" So is that human civilization? So what is the mistake of the human civilization? The mistake of the human civilization is that they have forgotten the relationship with God. So here is the scientific statement of our relationship with God. And then, according to that relationship, exactly in the same way, just like understanding your relationship, your citizenship in a state you can act nicely, similarly if we know our relationship with God, we can act very nicely and that is peaceful life. And besides that, this life, the present life is not all. We have got life after death. That is a fact. Just like we are continuously in life, in this present life, you were a child, I was a child. Everyone of us were a child. That was a life. Then we became boy, then we became youth. Now we are, I am becoming old, and generally, when this body will be useless, I will have to take another body. This is the way. Unfortunately, the people, they do not believe in the next life. Although in every day affair they are experiencing that ""I am eternal. I can remember the days of my childhood. I can remember the days of my youthhood, my boyhood, and I am still working. That means I am continuously there although my body in different ways have changed."" So it is a fact that even after changing this body, you will have another body. Just like you are sitting in this room. Now, if you vacate this room, that does not mean you are finished. You have gone in some other room. So this is a great science. And people are neglecting this science. They have no, I mean to say, information. There are so many departments in universities, technological, medical, engineering, but where is the department to know or understand what is this life, what is God, what is our relationship? So this is not very good civilization. So there is life after this life. Just like progressive life, a child is progressing to youthhood, the youth is aspiring to become a big man, important man. As in this life there is progressive life, similarly, life after life, there is also progress. There are different grades of life. So we get information from authoritative books that there are 8,400,000's of different grades of life, and there are 900,000's of aquatic life, two million species of plants and trees, about eleven hundred thousand species of life of birds, three million types of species of beast, and 400,000 species of this human body. Out of that 400,000's, different kinds of human bodies, the civilized body is a great boon. At that time we can make further progress. Either we can transfer to other planets... The standard of living, comforts, are many, many thousands times better than this planet. But in this book,Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is,we get information that within this material universe, wherever you go, either you remain in this planet or you go to the moon planet or to the sun planet, or there are millions and trillions of planets... The highest planetary system is called Brahmaloka. There the duration of life is very, very great. You cannot calculate even twelve hours of their days. These are described in this book,Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is.Sahasra-yuga-paryantam arhadyadbrahmaṇoviduḥ[Bg.8.17].Four hundred... Three thousand years is the duration... Four hundred and, yes, four hundred and three thousands of years, solar years, is the one unit ofyuga.Such thousandyugasmakes twelve hours of the Brahmaloka planet. Similarly, they live there for a hundred years. But these four things, namely birth, death, old age, and disease, these four things are everywhere, either you live in this planet or moon planet or sun planet or any other planet. The duration of life may be very, very great. Just like in comparison to the ant, our life, human being—we have got hundred years age—so to the ant it may be very astonishing: ""Oh, how such a great length of time one can live?"" Similarly, we may be astonished by hearing twelve hours duration of Brahmaloka, but actually there is. But still, you cannot avoid death. Death is there. So from this book we understand from the version ofKṛṣṇa, or God, thatā-brahmabhuvanāllokāḥpunarāvartino 'rjuna[Bg.8.16].Even if you go to the highest planetary system, again you have to come back. In this way, all living entities are rotating from one planet to another, from one species of life to another. But we don't want this actually. If I say that ""If I give you a nice body, youthful body, and eternal body, full of knowledge,"" would you not like to have it? Nobody likes old age, nobody likes death, nobody likes to die, nobody likes to take birth again, enter into the womb of mother and live there ten months. You are tight packed."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Let's pause here and let the tape just advance a little bit. That would make a good segment. [break],Prabhupāda,"...consciousness, the next question. Now, this is the basic principle ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So for attainingKṛṣṇaconsciousness, there are several stages. The first stage is faith or inquisitiveness. Just like you have come to me. This is the first stage, out of inquisitiveness or some faith, that ""These people are teachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We have heard it is very nice. Let us see what it is."" This is the first stage. This is the first stage. One should be inquisitive and have little faith or little respect forKṛṣṇaconsciousness. ""It is very nice, they are speaking, doing nice work."" This is the first stage. The second stage is that in the first stage, if you find it, it is interesting, then the second stage is to associate with us, to understand more. Just like we are having our classes three days in a week. We are having class morning daily, but for public we are holding classes in the evening from seven to nine in our temple. Perhaps you know. You have been yesterday there? So we are holding classes there and discussing on this book, havingkīrtana,distribution ofprasādam.So it is very nice. There is no labor. Simply you come, you hear nice songs, you dance, you take nice food, you hear nice philosophy, and you think over, and you may go home. We don't ask anybody that ""You press your nose like this, you make your head down like this, make exercise like this."" We don't ask anybody. But people automatically like to dance with us. Although dance is labor, but they like it. So the next stage is to associate with us, to understand more and more. This is the second stage, to associate. First stage, faith and respect, and second stage, association. The third stage, if by association one becomes serious, that ""I shall become a regular student of Swamiji,"" that is third stage. That is called initiation. Just like these boys. They are initiated. So in that stage they are guided by me. They follow strictly. Just like we have got for the initiated students we have got six, four principles. We do now allow illicit sex life. No, we do not allow these boys or girls sex life without being married. Yes. This is one regulation. We don't allow them to take anything which is not offered to the Deity. So we offer to the Deity foodstuff, grains, fruits, flowers, milk products, in that way, no meat, no egg, nothing of the sort. Simple food. They are nutritious. We prepare very... Perhaps you have participated in our love feast in Sundays. Yes."
Woman:,Woman:We're going to... We'll come next Sunday.,Prabhupāda,"They like it. So many, hundreds of preparations... We can give at least three hundred preparation, many varieties, simply on grains and milk product and fruits. That's all. We don't kill animals, don't kill birds, no. But we make very nice preparations. Everyone likes. So this is one of the restriction, that you cannot take anything which is not offered toKṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇaconscious. This is the second restriction. And the third restriction is no intoxication—no smoking, no drinking, even no tea taking, no coffee taking, nothing: These American boys they are accustomed to all these habits very naturally, but they have given up. They don't take. In our temple there is no tea-taking, no coffee-taking, no cigarette smoking, nothing of the sort, you see. This is the third restriction. And the fourth restriction is that you cannot take part in gambling or some unnecessary sporting because you have to utilize your time. Your time is very short. If you miss this opportunity of human form of life... Because we do not know when death is coming. It is not that because I am old, I am nearing death, and you are young, you are not nearing death. Who knows that you may die before me? So there is no certainty. So the principle is that because this human form of life is so important to perfect oneself inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, he should not waste even a minute. You see? So therefore we don't allow unnecessary sporting. You see? This is simply waste of time. So no illicit sex life, no meat-eating or animal food, no intoxication, no gambling. So every student has to follow these four prin... Otherwise I don't initiate. I don't take cheap students, that ""You can do whatever you like, and you pay me some money. I give you somemantra,and you become God."" I don't say like that. I don't bluff like that. I have not come to earn money from your country, but I have come to your country to give you something sublime, not to take you, not to take from you, not to exploit you, but to give you something sublime. You see? So that is the third stage, initiation. And then, if you are situated in the third stage nicely—that means if you follow the regulative principles under my direction—then the fourth stage automatically comes. After this third stage, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, up to eighth, automatically comes. That is gradual development. So in the third stage, if you follow the regulative principle and chant with some prescribed number, numerical strength, then your all misgivings will be over automatically. What are these misgivings? The first misgiving is that I am this body. Everyone is under the concept of this body. This is... I am not this body. That is a fact. But body is changing. There are many examples. One of the example is a very common example. Suppose a man is dead. Now everybody is crying, and if we ask ""Why you are crying?"" ""Oh, my son is dead."" I can say, ""Your son is lying here. Why you are saying that he is dead?"" ""No, no. He is dead. He is gone. His body is lying."" Therefore he is different from the body. Immediately you can understand. You say, ""No, he is gone. His body is lying."" Don't you say at that time? So you understand at the time of death that the man was different from the body. But during this lifetime, I was taking care of his body only. Why did I take care of he? Because I did not know him. You see? This is a misgiving. In this way there are so many misgivings. We are situated in a platform of misgivings only, misunderstanding, our present conditional life. Just like if my body, this body, I am different from this body, then how can I claim that America is my country? This is also another misgiving. If I do not belong to this body... I call myself an American or Indian... (coughs) (aside:) Water. Because accidentally this body is born on the land of America, therefore I call myself American, but if I am not this body, then how I am American? This is another misgiving. Yes. Then I am calling you as my son. You are calling him as your son, but what he is? He is a product of your body. So if you are not this body, how he is your son? In this way you go on. As soon as you study nicely that you are not this body, you will find that you belong to none of these. You are free. You see? This is calledBrahmanrealization, spiritual realization, this stage, when you understand that ""I am not this body. I do not belong to this country. I do not belong to this family. I do not belong to this society."" This is negative. Some philosophers are trying to make these things void. But actually I am existing. I am existing in misunderstanding. But that does not mean I am not existing. I am not void. Just like I am existing within this apartment. But instead of knowing myself, I have identified this apartment: ""myself."" So to simply to understand that ""I am not this apartment"" is not perfect knowledge. Then what is my position? What I am actually? When we come to that consciousness... At the present moment, I am conscious of this body, of this country, of this society, of the family. But when I perfectly understand that I am not any of these things, then my consciousness also changes because at the present moment my consciousness is absorbed with all these things. So as soon as I understand that I am not all these, then my consciousness must change, not that my consciousness will stop. If I am in misunderstanding, if I come to the right understanding, that does not mean my understanding is stopped. Rather, my understanding becomes purified. That means if I am not this, then I am this. That we do not know, what is that. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So when we are freed from this illusory consciousness and if we are situated inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then we get attachment. Because we are attached to all these things, attached to this body, attached to this society, attached to the country, so many things in relationship with the body. Now, after negativating my identity with this false identification, when I come to the right point, then I understand that I am Kṛṣṇa's. I am Kṛṣṇa's. Then your attachment forKṛṣṇaincreases because you transfer the attachment. Just like a child. A child is attached to play. But when he grows up, his attachment is transferred to study. That does not mean he gives up the attachment for playing, that attachment is lost. No. Attachment must be there, but that is transferred or purified. SoKṛṣṇaconsciousness means purified consciousness, real consciousness. And the next stage, after being freed from misgivings—attachment for the real identity,ruci.Thenāsakti,greater attachment. Then an ecstasy. That means I am coming nearer to God. Because I am God's... In the beginning I told you that we have forgotten our relationship with God. So when we are out of misgivings, we come to the platform of increasing attachment for God. So this attachment, when it is perfectional stage, it is called love of God. Love is here also. Instead of loving God, we are now loving dog. Love is there, but when you are out of misgivings, you transfer your love from dog to God. These are the different stages to come to the... How do you attainKṛṣṇaconsciousness? These are the stages. So if we follow cautiously and sentiently these six stages of development, you come toKṛṣṇaconsciousness automatically. [break] ...study. This meditation and breathing exercise is not part of our study. Because we are following a method which is direct method. I will give you the example. Just like there is a skyscraper house, and there are staircases to go to the top floor, say, hundredth floor, and there is elevator also. So if you take advantage of the elevator, you reach immediately hundred floor within a minute, but if you go step by step, step by step, it will take hours. So this meditation process is not possible at the present age. This meditation was recommended, according to Vedic literature, in the golden age, when the duration of life was very, very long, people were peaceful, there was no disturbance. The exact version in theVedasisic>kṛte.Kṛtemeans in the golden age, when everyone is pious. That is calledkṛta-yuga,age ofkṛta,very pious age. So in those ages people used to live one hundred thousands of years, and they were very pure, there was no sinful activity. In that stage, meditation was possible. Meditation requires certain principles. You have to select a solitary, sacred place. You have to sit alone. You have to close your eyes half, not full. If you close your eyes full, then you will sleep. And you have to concentrate on the tip of your nose, and you have to sit straight under posture, and then you have to exercise the breathing. If your inhalation is going this side, then you have to breathe this side. There are so many processes. So these things are not possible. Because our mind is so disturbed, we are engaged in so many outside work, it is not possible to concentrate on... You cannot find out a solitary place. The so-called meditation going on in a class. That is not meditation. Meditation cannot be performed in that way. It must be very solitary place, sacred place, and you have to do it alone. You see? So these facilities are not available at the present age. Besides that, that meditation process will take you a very long time to realize yourself. So meditation is there in our process, but it is a very quick process. What is that? We loudly chantHareKṛṣṇa. So even if your mind is diverted to some other subject, you will be forced to hearHareKṛṣṇa. You have to apply your mind. You see? Either you take it, ""Oh, somebody is disturbing,"" or you are enjoying, you have to, you are forced to turn your mind to this side. And if we go on chanting for a short time, the meditation is always there. And with the dancing, the breathing is also there, but it is a shortcut policy. That policy, the yogic meditation or breathing exercise,samādhi,it is already there in our process. But we don't take in that prescribed way of meditation because that is not possible in this age. It is very difficult. So meditation and breathing exercise is not a part of our program, but it is automatically performed by this process of chantingHareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare,HareRāmaHareRāmaRāmaRāma... That is automatically done. It is so nice process. Then your next question is, ""Is diet an important segment of the word?"" Yes. Diet is very important thing. Just like when a patient goes to a physician, he prescribes a certain type of diet. Why? That's a practical fact. Why you accept a physician prescription of diet? Suppose a man is suffering from diabetes; his diet is different. A man is suffering from tuberculosis; his diet is different. A man is suffering from typhoid fever; his diet is different. Therefore diet shall not be extravagant or whimsical. They must be selected. First of all we have to see what is the diet of the human being. Actually I read in some scientific magazine, a medical magazine, that our teeth is not meant for eating meats. These teeth are meant for eating fruits. Actually the shape of the teeth is like that, just like sharp knife. You can, apple you can take immediately. But if you take one piece of meat, you cannot eat so easily with these teeth. So first of all you have to understand what is your diet. So your diet is different from animals' diet. You take anything. Even stool is food for a certain animal, but that does not mean I have to eat stool also. Stool may be eatable for a certain type of animal. ""Oh, that is not my diet or food."" Similarly, we have to discriminate. Now so far we are concerned,Kṛṣṇaconscious person, we are studyingKṛṣṇaconscious. What is our diet? Our diet isKṛṣṇa-prasādam,what is offered, as I told you, that something is offered toKṛṣṇa. Then we take. We don't take anything direct. Just like these fruits. We have first of all offered toKṛṣṇa. Here is a plate. Then we take. That is our system. Even we take vegetables, fruits, we don't take directly. We first of all prepare or cut into pieces, offer to the Deity. Then we take. Now, the idea is that we take the remnants of food offered toKṛṣṇa. Now, when you offer something to some respectable person, you ask him, ""What can I offer you?"" If I go to your house and if you want to offer me something to eat, you will ask me what I wish to eat. That is the etiquette. So similarly, we have to offerKṛṣṇawhatKṛṣṇalikes to eat. So how we can know? In this book we have the things, whatKṛṣṇawants. He says, ""You give Me foodstuff,patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyaṁ[Bg.9.26]fruits, flowers, grains, milk, like that."" So our diet isKṛṣṇaprasādam.Therefore...Kṛṣṇawants these things. We prepare these things, and we eat the remnants of food. IfKṛṣṇasays that ""You give me meat,"" then we can offerKṛṣṇameat also. ButKṛṣṇadoes not say that.Kṛṣṇasays, ""Give Me fruits, flowers, grains."" So we have no quarrel with the meat-eaters. Let them do whatever he likes. But our concern is that unlessKṛṣṇatakes, we don't take. So in order to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, this is necessary, just like an important segment of the work. We cannot accept anything which is not offered toKṛṣṇa. Therefore this diet, this sort of diet, as you have tasted in our love feast, that is important. We cannot take outside the scope. So in that sense, diet is important. Besides that, from health point of view also, you require a balanced food—carbohydrate, starch, protein, and fat. That is scientific. So fat we are getting from milk, butter. So if I can get fat from milk and butter, why shall I kill the cow and animal? This is humanity. My necessity is to get some milk and fat. The cow is supplying you milk and fat sufficiently. Why should you kill it? I am going to beKṛṣṇaconscious, God conscious, and I am killing another God's creature? So it is very important work to select that: if anyone is serious to become God conscious orKṛṣṇaconscious. Therefore in our program meat-eating is forbidden. So that is very important in that sense. The next question is, ""So, what is the significance..."" I think I've already explained this. ""Is there a probationary period forKṛṣṇaconsciousness or does one attain this enlightening according to his own rate of development?"" Yes, everything requires little enthusiasm. Just like a boy is going to school with no enthusiasm, and a boy is going to school with nice enthusiasm. One boy is passing in the first class, first division and another boy is failing or he's passing in the third division. So the probation period, of course, I've already explained: to associate with us, the second stage. First stage is faith and respect, the second stage is association. That is probational period. And so far attaining enlightenment according to one's rate of development; that development depends on your enthusiasm; how far you are serious. But one should become very serious. That is the law in every sphere of achievement. So for attaining to the perfectional stage ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, one should be very much enthusiastic. Yes. He must attain to the perfectional stage in this life. And then one should be patient also. Enthusiasm does not mean if I attain something immediately the result is immediate. No. The result may be delayed but we should not be disturbed. But we must go on working with enthusiasm. This is called patience. Enthusiasm, patience and confidence. Because we believe inKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays that if you do this you get this result. Therefore I must have confidence. Just likeKṛṣṇasays that simply by understanding Him, what He is, how does He come, how does He walk, one immediately gets passport to enter into the spiritual kingdom. So we must have confidence that I'm working inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, I must go back to Godhead, back to home. This is confidence. So enthusiasm, patience, confidence. And...yaḥsyād ... niscyad...tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.Simply enthusiasm but no work. But you must be engaged in the prescribed duties ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. And you must keep always yourself in the association of devotees."
Guest:,Guest:Very effective.,Prabhupāda,So you should cooperate with us. So your questions are finished? Any extra question you can ask if you like.
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Swami, will you get a little closer to that microphone, if you will. You are the head of ISKCON, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Is it a church?,Prabhupāda,"It is not exactly a church, but it is an institution for understanding the science of God."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Could you tell people how you are dressed today, what's the significance of your clothes?",Prabhupāda,About the significance of our institution?
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:No, about the way your clothes, the way you're dressed today. Uh, the robes.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, the robe? Yes, I am asannyāsī.Thesannyāsīis the highest status of human social division. According to Vedic culture there are four divisions of human society.Brahmacārī,student life; then householder,gṛhastha;and thenvānaprastha,retired life; and thensannyāsalife, means preaching transcendental knowledge to the society from door to door. So this dress... In Vedic culture, there are different dresses for different persons. So this saffron colored dress means that he is admitted without any introduction anywhere because he's understood to be a man of transcendental knowledge. And the householders receive them and take knowledge from them. That is the system of Vedic culture."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:You also have a garland of flowers around your neck.,Prabhupāda,"That is offered by the disciples as a matter of respect to the spiritual master. It is not necessary that asannyāsīhave a garland like this, but if it is offered with respect he does not refuse."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Now, one more thing, you have some paint or color down your forehead and your nose and on all your followers who are here in the studio.",Prabhupāda,Yes. These marks are a temple ofKṛṣṇa. We mark these different twelve parts of the body. The idea is that we are being protected by God from all sides.
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:One other thing, I went to shake hands with everybody and I found that all your right hands were wrapped. What is the significance of that?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That wrapping... It is not exactly wrapped. It is a bag for our beads. We are chantingHareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare,HareRāmaHareRāmaRāmaRāmaHareHare. So the beads are supposed to be sacred and therefore we keep it in a bag so that it may not touch the dust or any other impurities. So it is not wrapping, it is covering of the sacred beads."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Now I just want to read one section here. I think you'll be able to... ""The International Society for Krishna Consciousness began when Swami Bhaktivedanta arrived from India with $2 on his person, a metal suitcase full of ancient-looking books and a cotton cloth robe, colored yellow, as a sign of the renounced order of life. In India, men of his order are completely dedicated to propagating the spiritual life of a mendicant wanderer. He had wandered across the sea upon the order issued to him by hisguruwho told him he should prepare to go to America to teach the principles taught in theBhagavad-gītāand to translate the sixty volumes of theŚrīmad-Bhāgavataminto English."" Now, are you aguru?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, I am the spiritual master of this institution, and all the members of the society, they're supposed to be my disciples. They follow the rules and regulations which I ask them to follow, and they are initiated by me spiritually. So therefore the spiritual master is calledguru. That is Sanskrit language."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Gurumeans teacher.,Prabhupāda,"Gurumeans not exactly teacher.Guru, the word, means heavy. Heavy. H-e-a-v-y, heavy."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Isguruand swami the same thing?,Prabhupāda,"Swami means practically the same idea. Swami means the master of the senses. One who has not control over senses, he cannot becomeguru. The renounced order means he's strictly away from all kinds of sense gratification, especially sex life. Therefore, he's called swami. Swami means the master. One who has become the master of the senses, he can become the spiritual master of the society. That is the idea."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:The swami... Now did I understand you to say the swami has no sex life?,Prabhupāda,"No, certainly not."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Certainly not. All right, now when you...",Prabhupāda,"Well, actually sex life is allowed only to the householders. According to Vedic culture, sex life is restricted. There are four divisions of society. Thebrahmacārīis strictly forbidden for sex life. Thevānaprastha,they are also forbidden for sex life, and thesannyāsī,they are also forbidden for sex life. So out of four divisions, three divisions are strictly forbidden for sex life. Only the householders they can have restricted sex life with married wife simply for begetting children. That is the Vedic culture."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Only for propagating children.,Prabhupāda,That's all.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Then there is a similarity to Catholicism. The priest is supposed to be celibate.,Prabhupāda,"Certainly. Anywhere there is spiritual conception, sex life is not indulged. Anywhere, either it may be Christianity or Hinduism... Sex life is materialism. That is opposite number of spiritualism. So people are trained gradually to refrain from sex life. And in thesannyāsalife he's completely trained. Therefore he's allowed to move in the society for preaching spiritual education."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:The whole world has heard of the Maharishi Mahesh. Is he part of your order?,Prabhupāda,No. I have heard so much in the paper.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:He is the world's most famousguruat the present time.,Prabhupāda,"He's notguru. But he's advertised his name like that (laughs). Aguruis different thing. But people are, in your country, in the western part of the country, of the world, people are after some spiritual information. So anyone who comes professing as spiritualist, he is welcome, and if he flatters, then it is very convenient to get followers. So we don't follow exactly in that way. We follow exactly the principles of Vedic ways of life. So in that way, sex life for asannyāsīis strictly prohibited."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:So many of the people are going to him for meditation. Is meditation part of your philosophy?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. But meditation as this Maharshi or any other swami or..., are professing, that is not exactly the process of meditation. The standard meditation is described inBhagavad-gītā.That is very difficult job. You have to select a solitary place, you have to sit in a certain posture, you have to regulate your life, complete celibacy, eating, sleeping... There are so many rules and regulations that that sort of meditation is absolutely impossible for the present way of life. For the present generation, the chanting, vibration of holy name of God, is recommended in the scriptures. It is said that meditation was possible in theSatya-yuga, when people were cent percent pure. And they are... For the present, mostly, people are impure. So they cannot execute meditation as it is described in the standard scriptures."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Isyogapart of meditation?,Prabhupāda,"Yogais a very broad term.Yogameans to connect with the Absolute Truth. That isyoga.Yogameans connecting link. So there are different varieties ofyoga. Just like one staircase, it is the connecting link to the top floor. So that is, everywhere you can say staircase, but one who has crossed a few steps and one who has crossed a few floors, they are not on the same level."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:I'd like to read one thing. This is evidently said by a man named Swami Śiva Premānada of New York'syogacenter. He said, ""If one has the time to put in about eight or ten hours a day for ten years, one might develop the power to see through a wall through meditation. I've seen people develop X-ray vision, but I've never seen the point of paying such a heavy price for it.""",Prabhupāda,But I don't think it is practical that one can meditate for eight to ten hours or twelve hours.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:For ten years.,Prabhupāda,"But it is... Yes, for ten years. It is most impractical proposition. Therefore, as recommended, we have to follow the regulation as recommended in the scriptures. For the present age, this meditation. Now, last night we hadsaṅkīrtanain the public library... Where is that? Oakland. So all people immediately joined us as soon as we began to chantHareKṛṣṇa. Immediately there is effect and there is no rules and regulation that you have to do this or that. Simply join,HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare,HareRāmaHareRāmaRāmaRāma... We had lectured in the YMCA Sunday School, little boys and children, they also joined with us. We performed thisHareKṛṣṇachanting in the park, the children, old men, young men, everyone joined. It is..."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Do you have a temple here, Swami, or do you meet in libraries?",Prabhupāda,"No, we have got a temple here. Actually it is Frederick Street, 518."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:What does your temple look like?,Prabhupāda,"It is temple, just there is Deity,Rādhā-KṛṣṇaDeity and it's very, a place of sanctuary. If you go there you'll find immediately some impulse of spiritual idealism."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Do you have altars?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Do you have any of the other things you find in the inside of churches?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes, we have altars, we have pictures. We offer fruits, flowers, incense, and immediately, by combination of these things, there is some spiritual atmosphere, and there is chanting. So people enjoy it very nicely."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:We're talking with Swami A.C. Bhaktivedanta, head of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. If you have questions our numbers are 478-3456, in the East Bay 832-9707, inSanJose 272-1233. [break] A.C. Bhaktivedanta, International Society for Krishna Consciousness. What does the wordKṛṣṇamean?",Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇais, means all-attractive.Kṛṣṇa."
Caller (Gargamuni):,"Caller (Gargamuni):Hello, Swamiji?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:I'd like to ask a question.,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:Why is this human form of life, why is this human life in such a diseased condition with war, pestilence, and famine?",Prabhupāda,"These are miserable conditions inflicted by material nature just to remind the conditioned soul that this conditioned life in the material nature is not for you. There is another place where you can live very peacefully. Just like in the prison life there is always infliction of miseries. If in the prison life one is comfortably situated, then he'll never go out, he'll try to live there. So these material inflictions of miseries reminds us that this place is not suitable for us. It is not our place. Our place is back to Godhead, back to home. Therefore these are the reminders that you must leave this place."
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:Yes. Also, what is our true identity?",Prabhupāda,What is that?
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:What is our true identity?,Prabhupāda,Actual identity?
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Actual identity is that you are spirit soul. And this material body is your covering. Just like dress. Just like when you dress, the real body is there. Similarly, we are within this material body. So we are taking more care for the dress and not for the body actually. But when a body is dead we can understand that there is something missing. That missing thing is the soul. In the modern educational field there is no department of knowledge to understand that what is that missing part. There are so many theories, but they are not practical. Therefore we have to understand the soul and its constitution from authoritative scriptures likeBhagavad-gītā.Then we can understand our identity actually. And in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamit is said that persons who are identifying themselves with this material body, they are not actually human beings. They are counted amongst the asses and cows. So that is ignorance or illusion."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Now, I want to ask you something. You said we live in a bad world, but through our mind, our soul, we can escape.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Or throughKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We're not solving anything then by doing that. We're sort of, in our own mind, we're running away.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that running away is the best sol... Suppose you are put in a prison house. The solution is to go out of it. If you want to make adjustment of the prison house, that is impossible. You may be a first-class prisoner or second-class prisoner, third-class prisoner, but you will remain a prisoner. But if you want freedom, then you must go out of the prison walls."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:But I notice you have many, you seem to have a lot of young men who are part of your organization. These young men must face the material problems of today like the draft and Vietnam and everything.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Isn't it difficult to belong toKṛṣṇaconsciousness and exist in this world we must exist in?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, the thing is that persons who are inKṛṣṇaconsciousness anywhere, even they are put into a very uncomfortable position, they are not suffering in the same way as ordinary man."
Caller (Gargamuni again):,"Caller (Gargamuni again):Thank you. Hello, Swamiji?",Prabhupāda,Yes?
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:What is the perfection of this life?,Prabhupāda,"The perfection of this life is to understand oneself, what I am. This is the beginning. Why I am suffering? If there is any solution of this suffering? And there are so many things. These questions should be there. Unless a man is awakened to these questions, that ""What I am? Why I am suffering? Wherefrom I have come, and where I have to go?"" then he's considered on the animal level. Because animals, they have no such questions. It is in the human form of life these questions are there. And their answers are all there in the scriptures. So if we are inquisitive and follow the answers from authoritative sources, then the solution of life is there."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Thank you caller. So, know yourself.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:You believe that sex is only for having children. You do not believe in alcohol or the use of any stimulants.,Prabhupāda,"No, that is prohibited."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:What do you believe in?,Prabhupāda,"We believe inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We have to purify. Just like this is also a belief, that you will be happy by drinking alcohol. That is your consciousness. I don't believe in that."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Do you have certain dietary rules for which you do not eat?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Certainly."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:What do you not eat?,Prabhupāda,"We don't eat anything which is not offered toKṛṣṇa. We first of all prepare foodstuff as recommended in the scripture. They are mostly from vegetable, grains, fruits, milk. So we have got enough food."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:No meat of any kind.,Prabhupāda,"No. No meat, no onion, no garlic, no intoxication, no liquor, we don't smoke even, we don't take tea, coffee. We simply take what is absolutely necessary for keeping the body fit to executeKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We don't indulge in luxury..., or for the satisfaction of the tongue."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Where in India did you come from originally?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, I was born in Calcutta. But after my acceptance of this renounced order of life, I am inhabitant ofVṛndāvana."
Caller:,Caller:Of where?,Prabhupāda,"Vṛndāvana. V-r-i-n-d-a-v-a-n.Vṛndāvanais a sacred place. It is about 90 miles south of New Delhi, capital of India."
Caller:,"Caller:Yes, yes, I see. One thing I just wanted to clarify, did you... are you are follower of LordKṛṣṇa?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:The callers know more about the subject today evidently than I do. Now, yourgurutold you to be a wanderer.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Asannyāsīmeans itinerant teacher. He will wander and teach from door to door.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:When was it that you arrived from India with $2?,Prabhupāda,"It was in September, 1965."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Several years ago.,Prabhupāda,About three years before.
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Now, you met a gentleman by the name of Harvey Cohen?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:And how has he helped you?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, in the beginning he helped me. Because I rented one room. That was $72 per month. So..."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Was this in New York?,Prabhupāda,"In New York, yes, Seventy-second Street West. So whatever there was shortage, he was supplying. I was getting some money by contributions in my lectures. But in the beginning my all expenditures were not sufficient collection. So the deficiency he was giving me."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Did he aid you in setting up the first center or temple?,Prabhupāda,"No, I started my temple in 1967, first July."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:In New York.,Prabhupāda,"New York, yes."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:How many temples are there now?,Prabhupāda,"Now we have got six temples. One in New York, one inSanFrancisco, one in Los Angeles, one in Boston, one in Montreal, and one inSantaFe. And another one of our students has gone to Buffalo, he's on the professional, for starting another temple."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:How many people belong to these six temples?,Prabhupāda,In each temple there are average about fifty people.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Fifty people.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Are they mostly young people? From the calls we've been getting and from the people here in the studio...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, they are invariably all young boys and girls. Yes."
Caller:,Caller:Is this Swami?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Caller:,Caller:What is God?,Prabhupāda,What is God? That's your question?
Caller:,Caller:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"God means the controller. Everywhere we have got some controller. So... But you will find there is another controller over the controller. So if you go on searching one after another, controller and the supercontroller, and, or the next controller, next controller, in this way, when you come to a place when the controller is absolute, there is no other controller, He is God."
Caller:,"Caller:Yes. Swami, you say you have to know yourself. Now, how does a person go about knowing when he knows himself, who he is and what he is. In other words, when does he reach the stage where he says, ""Hah! I know where I am and what I am.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes, there are two different processes of acquiring knowledge. One process is to research oneself by his own endeavor, by his limited sense speculation. And another process is to know from the authority. Just like deductive process, we say, man is mortal. This knowledge is received from higher authorities, just like our teacher or parents, we understand that man is mortal. Another process is one can make research whether actually man is mortal."
Caller:,"Caller:Well, is there some kind of a spiritual signal you get within yourself that tells you this?",Prabhupāda,"No, your question is what I am? So this what I am, you can search yourself by your mental speculation, that is one way. Another way to understand your position, from higher authority. So we take this process. We understand what I am from higher authority,Kṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays that He is God, and He says, ""All these living entities are My part and parcels."" So we are component parts of the Supreme Lord. Therefore as the component part of machine is to cooperate with the full machine, so our duty is to cooperate with the Supreme Lord. That is our identity."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:To joinKṛṣṇaconsciousness is a total commitment, then, to your way of life.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is total commitment to the way of life as it is prescribed in theBhagavad-gītā,the science of God."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Must one renounce his present religion?,Prabhupāda,"No, not necessarily. Religion is a kind of faith. So naturally, if you go to the higher standard of life, the stereotype faith does not act there. So this understanding,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, is transcendental to all religious faith. Faith you can change. But this you cannot change. Your constitutional position as part and parcel of God is never to be changed. You may accept a faith as Christianity or accept a faith, Mohammedanism. That is a mental situation. But this is your actual constitutional situation that you are part and parcel of the Supreme. That cannot be changed."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:What happens in your temples. Do you have services like other religions?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, generally we chant thismahāmantra,HareKṛṣṇa, and then we deliver speeches fromBhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,and then there are questions, we answer, and in that way the audience and the disciples they become enlightened and they advance."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:But there's no sermon as we would know in other churches?,Prabhupāda,"That is, you can call sermon, because there is prayer song and there is, I mean to say, recitation from scriptures..."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Well, you have six chapters, so evidently you cannot be everywhere at once. Who is in charge of a temple when you're not here?",Prabhupāda,"The students are being trained. The students, they also speak the same thing. There is nothing new. I also speak from theBhagavad-gītāand the students also speak from theBhagavad-gītā.TheBhagavad-gītāis the same in all the centers. But it may be because I have little more experience I can explain them a little more nicely. And the students, they also explain according to their experience. But the principle is the same."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Swami?,Prabhupāda,I do not know what is self-hypnosis.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Hypnotizing yourself.,Prabhupāda,"No, it is no question of hypnotizing. Meditation means to search out what I am. Just like if you sit down quietly, if you see your body, first of all see your finger, and question whether I am hand? You'll say, no. Whether I am this head? You'll say no. Whether I am this leg? Because everywhere I will say, ""It is my hand, it is my head, it is my leg, it is my sole."" Everything ""my."" So you have to find out what is ""I."""
Caller:,Caller:I see.,Prabhupāda,"Unless you come to that point, what is ""I,"" there is no meaning of meditation. Then the meditation is finished. Now, the activitiesaftermeditation begins. Meditation is to search out what you are. As soon as you know your identity, then your real activity begins. So we take it fromBhagavad-gītāwhat is my real identity and begin our service. So that is called devotional service."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Swami?,Prabhupāda,"We don't disagree with the teachings of Lord Jesus Christ because he's speaking also the same thing which we are also speaking, about the science of God."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:But she, I think she's saying, couldn't you just have taken the teachings of Jesus Christ as your religion?",Prabhupāda,But there is already adjustment...
Caller:,"Caller:(breaking in) No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that I believe that the Swami and many others who practice meditation and study theGītāare really dealing with the same premise, the first cause, that Jesus spoke of.",Prabhupāda,Certainly.
Caller:,Caller:Right?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, certainly."
Caller:,"Caller:Yes, that's what I wanted to know. I think there is a comparison, not between organized religion as such, but just getting down to thebarefacts of what Jesus spoke about. I think there's a similarity.",Prabhupāda,"There is similarity, but one thing is, just like mathematics taught in the lower class. Two plus two equal to four is equally applicable in higher mathematics, two plus two equal to four. In higher mathematics it does not become two plus two equal to five. Similarly, the teachings of Bible or teachings ofBhagavad-gītāare the same, the same ""two plus two."""
Caller:,"Caller:Right, right...",Prabhupāda,"But in theBhagavad-gītā,it may be taken as higher mathematics. That's all."
Caller:,"Caller:You know, may I ask you one thing, I read some parts of theBhagavad-gītāis it? And it said that knowledge is enveloped in ignorance, hence all men are deluded.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Caller:,Caller:And I thought that was a profound...,Prabhupāda,"Real, our real knowledge is covered by delusion."
Caller:,Caller:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, the real knowledge is that I am spirit."
Caller:,Caller:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"But we are identifying ourself with this body. Therefore we are covered in our knowledge, actual knowledge."
Caller:,"Caller:Yes, hello Swami. I would like to know how you get your money to make all your trips to India and New York and Mexico. Who provides you with money?",Prabhupāda,I was provided free passage in a shipping company.
Caller:,Caller:You was what?,Prabhupāda,Free passage.
Caller:,Caller:Free passage. Who pays for that free passage?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, free passage, there was no question of payment. The shipping company carried me free."
Caller:,Caller:The shipping company carried you free. Who buys your food for you?,Prabhupāda,"When I came, I came with some introduction letter. So my guests, they provided me."
Caller:,"Caller:Your guests provide you. In other words, you're a free-loader.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Caller:,Caller:Why do you set up your church into an area like the Haight-Ashbury? Your so-called temple?,Prabhupāda,Our so-called temple?
Interviewer:,Interviewer:I'll rephrase it. I'm going to punch her out. Why is your church located in the area of the hippies?,Prabhupāda,"It is not for particularly selected the hippies' quarter, but the boys they found a cheaper place in that quarter. Therefore they occupied that place."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Cheapest place you could find.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Because we are not very rich institution. So we found it cheaper. So we selected it. It is not for the reason that because it is hippie quarter, therefore we selected it. No."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Actually, most hippies couldn't join your religion because they take drugs...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, we are completely different from the hippies, because hippies they are addicted to sex and intoxication, and these things are completely forbidden in our temple."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:You do perform wedding ceremonies?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:What is your wedding ceremony like?,Prabhupāda,"The same chanting,HareKṛṣṇa."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:Is it considered a legal wedding ceremony in this country?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, our society is incorporated under the religious act of New York state."
Caller:,"Caller:No, her sister, yes, Prudence, from this gentleman's Bostonāśrama.",Prabhupāda,No.
Interviewer:,Interviewer:That is the opening of your ceremony?,Prabhupāda,"That is, at the end we..."
Interviewer:,Interviewer:At the end.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, thanks(?) to the devotees."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Okay.Karma,is this a part of your religion?",Prabhupāda,"Yes,karma.Karmameans work, fruitive work. As you work, as you sow..."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:Go ahead, Swami. She's just going to listen to your answer on the radio. Go ahead with your description ofkarma.",Prabhupāda,"Karmameans fruitive work. Just like you are laboring for some wages. You get your wages. Similarly, this material world our work is rewarded. Good work is rewarded with good benefit and bad work is punished. This is the law ofkarma."
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:And the other question is ""Do you feel God is good?""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Interviewer:,"Interviewer:We are out of time, we want to thank you very much for...",Prabhupāda,"God is good, yes, certainly. (devotees laugh)"
Guru,Gurudāsa:731-9671. (end),Prabhupāda,"What is this maker, the trademark?"
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:Concord.,Prabhupāda,"Concord, yes. Concord is famous tape recorder company. (tapping microphone) It is all right?"
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:HareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, it acts as amplifier also? So I'll have to speak from here?"
Yamunā,"You don't have to... If all, the two microphones weren't so close, then it would be... We wouldn't have this noise, and you could speak as you like to speak.",Prabhupāda,"So Gargamuni wants that prayer? Solo, solo?"
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:Yes.,Prabhupāda,You also like that?
Yamunā,"Oh. (Prabhupāda chuckles) If it isn't too much energy, Swamiji, that would be very beautiful.",Prabhupāda,All right.
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:Also, when you used to sing in New York,Vande'Haṁ,you would add onCintāmaṇi.Govindamādi-puruṣaṁ.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, sometimes. You shall, I shall...? I shall pray that?"
Yamunā,"What does that mean, Swamiji, that new prayer?",Prabhupāda,Cintāmaṇi...That is description of Kṛṣṇaloka.
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:Yes.,Prabhupāda,You have?
Yamunā,"Yes, I have a copy of it.",Prabhupāda,Sit down? Why do you keep there?
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:So it's not too loud.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. (Prabhupāda chantsCintāmaṇiand other prayers) The symptoms ofKali-yugahave already begun, five thousand years past. And it will increase. [break] ...proud of advancing, but these things are important items of human civilization. They are decreasing. [break]"
Mālatī,"...world now where people, they already, if they live to be twenty-five or thirty, like you explained last night, that was a ripe old age. There are tribes in the world where people live to the age of thirty, and that is considered a ripe age. That is considered old age. And they usually die about thirty or thirty-two.",Prabhupāda,Where?
Mālatī,"In places in South America and Africa. So now, as the age ofKaliprogresses, will those people just eventually be diminished and wiped out because they already live so short?",Prabhupāda,"Not wiped out. Nothing is wiped out. The species remain. Maybe somewhere, maybe somewhere else. Nothing is wiped out."
Mālatī,They could go to another planet?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. There are so many places. The living entity is described in theBhagavad-gītāassarvaga. Sarvagameans he can go anywhere within this universe. He can go in the spiritual sky also.Sarvagameans including everywhere, if he likes. As I explained yesterday, last night,yāntideva-vratādevān[Bg.9.25].If he likes, he can go to the planets of the demigods, to thePitrloka, he can remain here, or if he likes, he can go to the planet ofKṛṣṇa. He has got this freedom. Just like there are many government posts. You can select any one of them, but you must be qualified for that. So it is a question of qualification, how you can go to the planets of the demigods, how you can go to the planet of thepitṛs.Ūrdhvaṁgacchantisattva-sthā[Bg.14.18].If you develop your modes of goodness, then you go to the, promoted to the higher planets because in the higher planets, the third-class living entities are not allowed. Don't you see that in here also, in America, for permanentvisawe have to undergo so many formalities? Why? The restriction is there, that American government cannot allow everyone to become a permanent resident here. Restriction. Similarly, in higher planets, only those who have developed the quality of goodness... The quality of goodness contains those eight principles: religiosity, truthfulness, cleanliness... Soūrdhvaṁgacchantisattva-sthā[Bg.14.18].Sattvameans quality of goodness. So one has to develop the quality of goodness. Not an upstart, simply having a play sputnik, he wants to go to the Candraloka, moon planet. It is not possible. What quality he has got? He will immediately die. Temperature is... (end)"
Devotee (1) (girl):,"Devotee (1) (girl):March 23rd, Stow Lake, walk with Swamiji.",Prabhupāda,"First thing is that calculation ofCandra, moon planet, there are different views. Different scientists, they have different views. It is not a standard. They have not agreed to the... Somebody says something, somebody says another thing. Speculation. That's all. But that idea, that it is very low in temperature, that is mentioned inBhāgavata.You cannot live in the water. You have to qualify yourself. (Sound of ducks). Just see. Their body is made just suitable for the water. So you have to qualify yourself. That is... Just like, in the spiritual sky they can live only spiritual body, and material body cannot live there. Material body is not allowed there.HareKṛṣṇa.Ūrdhvaṁgacchantisattva-sthāmadhyetiṣṭhantirājasāḥ[Bg.14.18].Those who are too much passionate, they are meant to live in this planet. This planetary system, status. There are many other planets like this world. So they are allowed to live here. Here all living entities, they are very much passionate. Andadhogacchantitāmasāḥ.And there are other planets, they are dark, dark planets, below this earthly planet. And the animals, they are in darkness. Although they're on this park, but they do not know where they are, darkness. Their knowledge is not developed. This is the result of the modes of ignorance. And those who areKṛṣṇaconscious, they are neither in darkness, nor in passion, nor in goodness. They are transcendental. So if one cultivatesKṛṣṇaconsciousness nicely, he is at once promoted to the Kṛṣṇaloka. That is wanted. You are all chanting sixteen rounds? No? (laughs)"
Śarādīyā:,Śarādīyā:I did at first but then I slipped back.,Prabhupāda,Is it very difficult?
Mālatī,"No, we do not know how yet to regulate our time too well. Some days we chant sixteen rounds and then the next day, I don't know what happens. I think we sleep too much, I mean I think I sleep too much.",Prabhupāda,How many hours you are sleeping?
Mālatī,About six to eight.,Prabhupāda,"That is not much. Sixteen... It takes only two hours, sixteen rounds.Huh? Two hours, or more than that?"
Mālatī,Two hours is all it takes to do the rounds.,Prabhupāda,So you have to spend two hours forKṛṣṇaout of twenty-four. (walks for awhile and chantsjapa) Yes?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Is there something wrong with sleeping eight hours?,Prabhupāda,"Sleeping and eating, this is the material disease. Sleeping, eating, mating... So they should be reduced as much as possible."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):If you're still tired...,Prabhupāda,"No, you can sleep till you are refreshed. Somebody's refreshed by sleeping four hours. Somebody is refreshed by sleeping ten hours."
Mālatī,"But we should not sleep when we have, in place of our devotional service.",Prabhupāda,"No, of course not. Devotional service is first."
Mālatī,So if we miss some sleep we should do it.,Prabhupāda,"We should forego sleeping even. The real regulated life is that if sixteen rounds is not completed, then we have to forego sleeping. You should take out hours from sleeping. We should be... The main thing is that we should always be careful that... We are going, we have taken up a very responsible task,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness. So we should be very much careful in discharging the duty. The devotee should be so much careful that he'll always see ""Whether this moment is spoiled or utilized?""Avyartha-kālatvam[Cc.Madhya23.18-19].Avyartha-kālatvam,that ""My time may not be wasted."" He should be so careful, ""Whether my time is being wasted?"" and time wasted, the time we engage for our bodily necessities, that is wasted. Generally, conditioned souls, they are simply wasting their time. Only the period which we have engaged inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, that is utilized. So we should be very much careful whether time is being wasted or being utilized."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Sometimes, well, if you (we) slept less, we could do more forKṛṣṇa, but at the same time you (we) would be very tired. I mean, you could be... Well, you could regulate that.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Practically everything depends on practice.Abhyāsa-yoga-yuktenacetasānānya-gāminā[Bg.8.8].Abhyāsa-yoga.Abhyāsa-yogameansyogapractice... Practice it. So this wholeKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is to practice transferring from one kind of consciousness to another. So we require practice. Just like one man can run few miles. I cannot run even onemile. He has practiced. We see some boys, they run, run on. They practice. Practice it. Strength of the heart increasing by practice. And if I run, my heart will be palpitating. Because I have no practice. So by practice, everything can be attained.HareRāmaHareRāmaRāmaRāmaHareHare. [break] ...determination. And this determination is increased by celibacy.Brahmacāryais recommended to keep oneself determined. Abrahmacārī,if he determines something, he executes. He has got that strength of mind. Those who are too much addicted to sex life, they cannot be determined. They cannot be fixed-up. They are fluctuating, changing. People are, in modern day, they cannot sit down in a place for a long time. Therefore so much traveling. The traveling business is very prosperous. Everyone wants to travel. They cannot fix, fix up. So the processes recommended, they're very valuable, but it is not possible to follow them all in the present age because everything is reducing. So our method is to pray toKṛṣṇato give us the necessary strength. That's all. Otherwise, by regular practice, this age is very difficult. Unfavorable. First thing is memory is very short. We cannot remember. Life is very short. Life is short, at the same time, so much disturbed by anxiety, by disease, by natural disturbances.Roga-śokādibhiḥ.Short life; that is also disturbed by disease and lamentation. Every moment there is something for which you have to lament. ""Oh!""Roga-śokādibhiḥ.And disease. This body is a breeding ground of all kinds of disease. Life is short and it is so much disturbed. So how it is possible to practice? Therefore, this one practice—chantingHareKṛṣṇa, and hearing—that is very nice. And praying toKṛṣṇa, ""Please give me strength.""Hare, ""O Energy ofKṛṣṇa, OKṛṣṇa, I am fallen, I have no strength. Please accept me."" That's all. ""I have no qualification. I am frail. I am trying, but I am failing."" All these appeals should be made. AndKṛṣṇais all-powerful, He can do anything. Even we, we do not perform, trying our best, if we fail,Kṛṣṇawill help us. Just like a child tries his best, but he falls down. The mother takes up and, ""All right. Come on. Walk."" Like that. Yes?"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Swamiji? Is doing something other than chanting, like going to school and paying attention to what's there, if you're doing that so you can spreadKṛṣṇaconsciousness, is that just as good as chanting?",Prabhupāda,Chanting is good everywhere.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Yes, but, I mean, if you can't chant all day.",Prabhupāda,"If there is some inconvenience in chanting loudly, you can chant slowly. Loudly, slowly... Within mind you can chant. This simple practice, you'll give up all kinds of (microphone rattling)..."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Sometimes in school you have your, your mind is focused on their problems that they are, I mean... (plane going overhead)",Prabhupāda,"Not sometimes. Practically, we are always disturbed. (Walks for awhile)"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Swamiji, would it be all right for Cathy to become a devotee?",Prabhupāda,I don't follow.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):To be initiated. Cathy. To be initiated. She's the girl with the baby.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. If she can perform the..., there is no objection."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):She would like to.,Prabhupāda,You are very kind upon her. (laughs) Yes.Vaiṣṇavais very kind. (pause) It is very heavy?
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Because memory is reducing, therefore nature is helping to manufacture so many machines."
Mālatī,"Is that why people are making these machines, because they can't remember? Is that a sign ofKalithat there's more machines to help people?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. And nowadays in the courts, they use machines. The judges also cannot remember what has been argued between the parties. So they take this tape recorder and give judgement. Because the argument is going on for two days, three days, how much he can remember? And when he gives judgement he has to take consideration of all the arguments, then give his judgement. So this machine helps."
Mālatī,If somebody had a big dollar bill the judge would remember.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Mālatī,If somebody gave the judge a big dollar bill he would remember.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That means truthfulness is not there, diminished. The same thing. Because truthfulness has diminished, therefore you can bribe anybody and he can tell lie for you. We are in a very precarious condition. Very unfavorable condition. The best thing is to prayKṛṣṇa, ""Please pick me up very soon and let me go back to Your place."" If you have to come back again, oh, you do not know how much misery we have to undergo. Because with the advancement ofKali-yuga, everything is becoming more and more miserable. There is no happiness in family life, there is no happiness in social life, there is no happiness in political life, there is no happiness in earning livelihood. Everything is encumbered. All impediment, full of impediments."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):One of my friends said, ""(inaudible), you want to tell us everything, so why don't you build a machine to chantHareKṛṣṇafor you?""",Prabhupāda,"Huh? Yes. Machine was not made for chantingHareKṛṣṇa, but we are utilizing it so that the machine-maker may be benefited. Because we employ everyone's energy toKṛṣṇa. So by his energy he has manufactured this machine, so we are employing in Kṛṣṇa's service so that he may be benefited, purified. We are showing him the mercy. Just like one flower picked up from a plant offered toKṛṣṇais offering benefit to that plant. Because his energy is in the service ofKṛṣṇa. Similarly, the person who has manufactured this machine, when it is employed inKṛṣṇaconsciousness business, he's benefited. Indirectly, we are giving him opportunity, although he does not know it. But his energy is being utilized forKṛṣṇa. We offerprasādam,the same principle. A man does not know aboutKṛṣṇa. But he wants to eat. By eating, he'll be graduallyKṛṣṇaconscious. So you have... Our business is to give opportunity to all forgotten souls to be engaged inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, today or tomorrow. The boys and girls who have come to this society, they have accumulated in that way, knowingly or unknowingly, someKṛṣṇaconscious qualification, and therefore they have taken this opportunity. (Pause) We have no dog friend. (Laughs)"
Mālatī,It's a dog taking a man for a walk.,Prabhupāda,We are all devotee friend. Where is your dog?
Mālatī,"Oh, he's gone.",Prabhupāda,Gone? (laughs)
Mālatī,Yes. Some very nice people who worship dogs took him.,Prabhupāda,"The dog saw that ""My master has become devotee, so it is useless to keep here."""
Mālatī,"These people who took him, they think he is a person.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Mālatī,They treat him like person.,Prabhupāda,He's a person. Dog is a person. Why imperson?
Mālatī,Pardon?,Prabhupāda,Dog is person also.
Mālatī,"Yes, but they treat him like I would... They... Human person. They treat him like... They worship him.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, but what is the difference between human person and dog person? No difference. So far eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, they are equal. Human personality is there when he'sKṛṣṇaconscious. Otherwise he's an animal, as good as dog."
Mālatī,"So these... If you do not take toKṛṣṇaconscious, you are a dog.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, equal to dog. Because he has no other conception except those four principles, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. That is there in the animals. Don't you see the swans? They are enjoying sex life. So what is the difference between man... A man also does like that. So long one is not above these four principles of animal demands, he's as good as animal. To meet animal demands in a polished way is not civilization. One must be above the animal demands. That is civilization. You have read that poetry, ""Alexander and the Robber""? Have you read?"
Mālatī,No.,Prabhupāda,"Alexander the Great, you have heard the name?"
Mālatī,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"He conquered all over the world almost. He went to India also. So he met one robber. So he arrested, Alexander. He was king. The robber said, ""Why you have arrested me?"" ""Because you are robber."" ""Oh, you are also great robber."" When Alexander was charging him that, ""You have done this,"" oh, he charges, ""You have done this. I have entered a private house; you have entered a private state. So you are a big robber."" Then he released him, ""Yes, what is the difference between robber and me?"" And Alexander, from that day, he stopped his conquering propaganda. ""Alexander and the Robber."" The robber proved that ""You are a big robber only. But because you are big robber, therefore you are called 'Alexander the Great.' But my business is the same as yours-encroaching upon others' property. Why do you think that I am culprit and you are innocent? You are also culprit. If I had power, I could have punished you. And you have now power, you are trying to punish me."" So Alexander the Great was convinced by robber."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):(Inaudible),Prabhupāda,Huh?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Did he kill himself?,Prabhupāda,Who?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Alexander the Great?,Prabhupāda,He killed himself?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):I don't know.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, I do not know."
Gargamuni:,"Gargamuni:This was recorded at Stow Lake inSanFrancisco on March 23rd, 1968, about 7:30 in the morning. Stow Lake is Swamiji's favorite walking place. (end)",Prabhupāda,"""...you, under the direction of Lord Śiva. I worshiped Lord Śiva very successfully, and I prayed from him some sources of my happiness. So he has directed me to see you, that you have got that thing. So please give me that."" SoSanātanaGosvāmī said ""Well, what can I give you? Oh, all right. Can you find out some stone in that garbage?"" There were heaps of garbage, and the man searched out and found out a stone. ""Sir, do you mean to say this stone?"" ""Yes."" ""So what is this?"" ""This is touchstone. You take it and touch it to iron. It will become gold."" ""Oh, you are very ... You're so... Now I shall become the richest man in the world. I shall take heaps of iron and touch with this stone, and it becomes gold."" So he, with great joy, he went out and he tried that actually, touching the stone, iron is becoming gold. But he thought that, ""Lord Śiva directed thatSanātanaGosvāmī has the greatest benediction, I do not think this stone is greatest benediction because it was placed with garbage."" So he came back and appealed toSanātanaGosvāmī that ""Lord Śiva told me you have got something most valuable. I don't think this stone is most valuable. Otherwise, why would you keep it in the garbage? You must have something more valuable. So you must give me that because that because Lord Śiva directed me to receive from you."" ThenSanātanaGosvāmī told him, ""Would you like to take that?"" ""Yes, sir. I have come for that purpose."" So he asked him, ""First of all, throw away the stone in theYamunāRiver."" So he threw away the stone. ""Sit down and chantHareKṛṣṇa."""
Devotees:,Devotees:Oh! (Laughter.),Prabhupāda,"""Forget everything. Sit down with me and chantHareKṛṣṇa."""
Gargamuni:,Gargamuni:He did it?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Because he associated withsādhu,Lord Śiva,SanātanaGosvāmī. So everything was purified, changed. By association, good association, everything is possible. Therefore you have to make this association ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness so perfect that anyone who comes in contact with that association, he becomes purified automatically. The association is so important. Anyone who will come in contact with the association, he'll be purified. Just like by association one becomes contaminated, similarly, by counter-association, one becomes free from contamination."
Kṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇadāsa:Swamiji? I'd like to ask you is this good enough for the flute? This would be for the head of the flute.,Prabhupāda,Wood? It can't be.(?)
Kṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇadāsa:No. I'd cast it in gold.,Prabhupāda,Oh. This ivory?
Kṛṣṇa,"Kṛṣṇadāsa:Yes, that's ivory.",Prabhupāda,So what do you want to do?
Kṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇadāsa:That would be on the head of the flute.,Prabhupāda,"Flute? Oh, nice."
Kṛṣṇa,"Kṛṣṇadāsa:Oh, the lion's all right.",Prabhupāda,"Very good. Generally, on the head of the flute is given the mouth of the shark. Shark fish. You have seen shark? Like that... But that is also good."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Swamiji? I have obtained today a large piece of...,Prabhupāda,Stone? Flat.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yes. Marble. ForKṛṣṇacomes home,(?) back ofKṛṣṇa.(?)",Prabhupāda,"Very nice. So it is not so high. How much it is, height?"
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:This one is only for practice. And then I have obtained...,Prabhupāda,"Oh, oh."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:...a large one. It is very difficult stone because it's like glass almost. I have to practice. And later a larger one.,Prabhupāda,"So first of all you... This is called, what is called, test stone."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Praṣṭhipāta,it is called in Bengali. They test gold. By rubbing on the stone, they can understand what is the value of the gold. In India they are simply keeping a stone like this, and you take something golden, and they will at once test by simply rubbing on it. So experienced. By the glazing of the gold they will understand what is the value of this. It is experience. But this stone is used."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Marble?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now, as soon as you get that church, all thegṛhasthasandbrahmacārīs,they will have to bring money. (Laughter) Is that not right?"
Devotees:,"Devotees:Yes, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"There was one clergyman lecturing in a Sheffield coal-mine that, ""If you don't worship Jesus Christ, then you will go to hell."" So first of all one man asked him... First of all, the clergyman inquired, ""Do you know Jesus Christ?"" So they were silent. So one of them inquired, ""What is his number?"" They thought that ""Jesus Christ must be one of us,"" I mean to say, workers in the mine. So he must have got a number. ""So what is his number?"" Then the clergyman could understand that ""To whom I am speaking."" So then he explained, ""Oh, Jesus Christ is not one of you. He is son of God. He has come to deliver you. If you don't worship Him, then you will go to hell."" Then one of them said, ""What is hell?"" Then he described, ""It is very dark, moist, and so on."" So they were silent, because they work in the mine. (laughter) They were silent. ""What is this hell? It is all right."" Then the clergyman thought how to impress them. Then, after a few minutes, he said, ""No. The hell is very dangerous."" ""How?"" ""There is no newspaper."" ""Oh, horrible."" (Laughter) Because in your western countries everyone is fond of newspaper. So he stressed, he hit the point, that ""There is no newspaper."" So we have to hit to the point that there is no tax-man. So what is your question?"
Devotee:,"Devotee:My question was... No, that's a good answer.",Prabhupāda,"(Laughs) Yes. Your materialistic life is full of anxiety. That is the main symptom of materialistic life. We are always anxious, everyone. President Johnson, he's anxious, ""Oh, my presidency is going on. Now I shall no longer be president."" He's thinking, very much anxious. And, similarly, you are also thinking, another man is also thinking. Everyone is anxious. Nobody is free from anxiety. And when you go to Kṛṣṇaloka or anyVaikuṇṭhaplanet, the first thing is that you have no anxiety. That is spiritual life. Always joyful. (Baby cooing). No anxiety. Because she knows, ""My mother is there. She will protect me from everything."" So no anxiety means when you know that ""Kṛṣṇa will protect me,"" you have no anxiety. To become in the family ofKṛṣṇa. We are already in the family ofKṛṣṇa, but in a different way. Just like if one is in the prisonhouse, he is in the government's protection, but in a different way."
Yamunā,"Swamiji, Jānakī-devīwrote me this very nice letter where she had a dream that there was a gigantic platform above the surface of the earth, and all of our devotees, our Godbrothers and sisters and you, were assembled on this gigantic platform forsaṅkīrtana.And we had such a thunderous joy, magnificentkīrtana,that the whole earth... When you said,""Jayaoṁparaṁparamahaṁsa,""the whole earth bowed down to you like this. And we were all crying, so happy. And you said, ""Now myGuruMahārājais satisfied."" That was her dream.",Prabhupāda,"Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you for your dreaming like that. It is very pleasing to me. Yes, I want to see like that. [Break]"
Devotee:,"Devotee:Swamiji, is the dream world the real world?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is reflection of the real world. Reflection is real for the time being. This world is also dream, for the time being. Because this body is not permanent, so it is also a dream. A dream for 100 years or 50 years or 70 years, but that dream is 50 minutes. At night we see the dream for 50 minutes, and this dream is 50 years. That's all. It is a question of time. It is also dream. But dream is reality... So long we see it and enjoy it, that is reality. Just like a man in dream he's crying. It is dream. But the effect is there. Reaction is there. In that sense, dream is reality. Reality, temporary reality, flickering reality. Otherwise, it is reality. (end) Chant."
Devotee (1) (girl) (sings):,Devotee (1) (girl) (sings):Śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.,Prabhupāda,Yes. You learn this song.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Water-logged, yeah. The skin gets water-logged?",Prabhupāda,"No, not that. There are some kind of weeds within the water."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Oh. Algae?,Prabhupāda,Maybe.
Devotee (2) (boy):,Devotee (2) (boy):Seaweed.,Prabhupāda,"Seaweeds, yes. So they... All over the body there was some seaweeds. Not exactly... He was very unclean and odd-looking, and beard and ugly. So he thought that ""He's a greatyogi. If I refuse, 'No, I'm not going to hand over my daughter to you,' then he may be angry and create some catastrophe."" So he said, just to avoid him, that ""I have got eight daughters, and it is the desire of my daughters that they should be given over to one husband."" No, that ""they should be married all at once. So unless I find other husbands for my daughters you have to wait."" So immediately, ""Yes, I shall myself become eight then."" And he expanded himself, eight expansions. So at that time what could he say? He said, ""You know, my dear sir, that they are princesses after all. They may not like such ugly husband."" Oh, he at once became very youthful and beautiful. Then he married. So in the history you can find that a perfectyogican expand himself. So similarly,KardamaMunialso expanded into nine. He marriedDevahūtion condition that unless his wife has got sufficient children, he'll not leave her, and he must leave her. So he expanded himself nine and begotten nine daughters. So we can find from history, thePurāṇas...Purāṇasall means history,Purāṇas.Old history.Purāṇameans old. So even a perfectyogican expand, what to speak ofKṛṣṇa. He is calledYogeśvara, the supremeyogi. In theBhagavad-gītāyou'll find this word aboutKṛṣṇa,yatrayogeśvaraḥhariḥ.Yogeśvara. He's perfect in all practices of mystic power. So these five expansions,śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanyaprabhunityānanda-śrī-advaitagadādharaśrīvāsādi-gaura...Kṛṣṇaappeared in five expansions.SriKṛṣṇaCaitanya, LordCaitanya, isKṛṣṇaHimself. AndPrabhuNityānanda, His immediate expansion. Just likeBalarāma.KṛṣṇaandBalarāma. AndAdvaitais incarnation. AndGadādharais internal potency. And Śrīvāsa, marginal potency. And there is another potency, external potency. The external potency is not there. External potency means by which this material world is manifested."
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):What is the difference between an expansion and an incarnation?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Mālatī,That man is...,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Mālatī,"I think I understood you to say that man's intelligence is higher in purpose and it's not manual service(?), taking advantage of it.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, his higher intelligence is utilized for purification. That is the teaching."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):You were talking aboutPrahlada.,Prabhupāda,"Yes,PrahladaMaharajasaid. Yes. About this body. It is arrangement, according to different body. Now, these swans, they have left this, defending, they're going away. This is defending only. Yes. And as soon as they're on the water, they think, ""Oh, we are safe because these rascals cannot come in the water."" (laughter) They are thinking about us ""rascals."" As we are thinking about them that they are lower animals, so they are also thinking, ""These are rascals."" Just like some father rebukes a son, the son also thinks of the father as rascal, ""Unnecessarily he's chastising me."" There is a proverb that as the child grows... [break] ...also thinks that ""This boy is a fool; he'll do wrong by..."" This is stated. And the child is stated in a different way. Just like sometimes our audience also. When we speak they think, ""What nonsense he's speaking. Oh,Kṛṣṇa, what is thisKṛṣṇa? Let us enjoy."" They are not purified. So thisPrahladaMahārājasays that according to the body, the specific facilities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending is already arranged. It is already arranged. So one hasn't got to learn. Just like for mating. There is no college or school where in the classroom dis..., that ""This is way you have tomate."" Everyone knows automatically. Everyone knows how tomateautomatically. Nobody is taught how to laugh. Oh, when laughing comes, it, automatically one laughs. Nobody's taught how to cry. Everyone cries when there is some distress. So these things, what is wanted as the necessity of my body, so arrangement is there. But because we have forgottenKṛṣṇa, you think that ""We can do something."" Therefore we take advantage of our high intelligence to defend ourselves more nicely, to have mating more nicely, or eating more nicely. And a devotee should be satisfied that whateverKṛṣṇaarranged, that's all right. ThatKṛṣṇaprasādamwe will take. WhateverKṛṣṇahas kindly sent, let me be satisfied with this. They do not want more than that. Similarly, ""Kṛṣṇa has sent me this woman as my wife, oh, let me be satisfied with that."" That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness, that He's pleased to send me such foodstuff, He's pleased to send me such wife, He's pleased to give me strength for so much defense."" So the whole question is solved there. But because we have got high intelligence, we are going to surpass the intelligence ofKṛṣṇa. ""Oh,Kṛṣṇahas given me this wife? Why not search out another nice wife?"" That means I am going to surpass the intelligence ofKṛṣṇa. ""Oh,Kṛṣṇahas sent thisprasādam.Oh, this is all vegetables. Why not take some animal food and liquor?""Kṛṣṇadoes not send you liquor. You have manufactured.Kṛṣṇahas sent you this fruit, He has sent you the grains,Kṛṣṇahas sent you the milk. You should be satisfied. Why should you manufacture liquor? Why should you manufacture slaughterhouse? We don't eat meat. Are we dying ninety percent of Indian population, they don't eat meat. They're simply vegetarian. Yes. And you can see how they are healthy. They cannot get sufficient food, that is different thing. That is maladministration.Kṛṣṇahas given sufficient food for all the people of the world. Somewhere the foodstuff is being thrown in the sea, and somewhere people are starving. This is want ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. If a man becomes, if the president becomesKṛṣṇaconscious president, then he'll think ""This foodstuff is Kṛṣṇa's. It is not our result. SoKṛṣṇaclaims all living entities as His sons. So we are sons of God, and the Indians or other poverty-stricken countries, they are also sons of God. So if we have got enough, why not send there?"" Why you are putting the foodstuff, which no human being can produce, you are throwing it in the water. This is lack ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. ThereforeKṛṣṇaconsciousness education is greatly needed for human society. Do you follow,Gurudāsa?"
Guru,Gurudāsa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So you have to convince people like that, that it is not a sentimental institution. We are teaching the thing which is very absolutely needed for the human society. As soon as one becomesKṛṣṇaconscious, his personal questions and problems are solved. And if others adopt the same principle, then social-political questions are also solved. So we have to teach. They will say it is not practical. Why not practical? No, anything is not, not practical. There are so many scientific... You discovered. Just like this tape recorder. This is advantageous to the human society. But it is not practical that everyone will have a nice tape recorder. That is not practical. But when you go to manufacture, say the discoverer, ""Oh, that it is not practical; therefore it should not be manufactured."" Similarly,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness may not be practical for all, but that does not mean it should not be preached. The customer will take. Just like this tape recorder, one has got money, you have purchased, taking advantage. Similarly, there are many pious persons who can takeKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Just like you have taken. You are not ordinary common men. There must have been some pious activities in your past lives. Therefore you have taken to thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness seriously.Bhagavad-gītāsays,yeṣāṁtvanta-gataṁpāpaṁ.[Bg.7.28]A sinful person cannot understandKṛṣṇaconsciousness. It is said,yeṣāṁtvanta-gataṁpāpaṁ.One who has completely vanquished all sorts of sinful reactions. Now, the question may be that whether one can finish all sorts of sinful reactions within this material world. No, that is not possible. But it is possible also. What is that? That is also answered in theBhagavad-gītāthat ""You give up everything. Surrender unto Me. I shall give you protection from all sinful reactions."" So I may be sinful and there are so many reactions awaiting me for giving me trouble, but as soon asKṛṣṇatakes charge of me, then everything is finished. How it can be finished? Because He is all-powerful, He's the supreme. Just like if the president says... One man is ordered to be hanged. If the president says, ""No, he should not be hanged,"" then immediately all others sanction. Because he's the supreme. Similarly, if we surrender toKṛṣṇa, in spite of a huge stock of sinful reactions awaiting me, simply for the purpose of my surrendering toKṛṣṇathey're all set aside byKṛṣṇa. He'll see to it. Simply surrender. And that surrender, as soon as it is done, then the other word says,yeṣāṁtvanta-gataṁpāpaṁ...[Bg.7.28].One who has finished all kinds of reactions of sinful activities,janānāṁpuṇya-karmaṇām,persons executing pious activities... And the most pious activity is devotional service. ""How is that? There are so many other kinds of activities. What is this? This man has made so much charity, he has made so many hospitals, he has ...(unclear)... in such things. And this man is simply chantingHareKṛṣṇa. Do you mean to say he is more pious than that man who has made so much charity?"" Theśāstrasays, ""Yes. Yes."" Why? That is also explained in theBhāgavata.Savaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo yato bhaktiradhokṣaje[SB1.2.6].That activity is considered to be the highest pious activity. TheBhāgavatadoes not say what kind of activity. ""That activity which leads one to be a devotee of the Lord."" That activity is not limited. Any activity that makes one progressing for realization ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, that is higher, the highest pious activity. That is the description. Just as military art is not a very pious activity, killing art. But because the killing art exhibited byArjunawas leading him to this platform of satisfyingKṛṣṇa, so that became the highest pious activity.Savaipuṁsāṁparo...We have to see whether by his activity he's gaining strength inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Then it is highest. It doesn't matter whether it is photography or business or painting or cooking. It doesn't matter. WhetherKṛṣṇais being satisfied by his activities? Just like you are engaged in different activities. But as soon as you bring your money and engage in the Society's cause, oh, I am very gratified. I do not inquire... Of course, we do not encourage impious activity. That is not the meaning. Butphalenaparicīyate.Because you offer the result of your activities toKṛṣṇa, that becomes pious.Savaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo yato bhaktiradhokṣaje[SB1.2.6].So that is the standard of pious activity. Now, this is also pious activity, heeding before teacher. That if by satisfying the poor teachers one becomes pious, how much pious he is who is trying to satisfy the supreme teacher,Kṛṣṇa. He's also a living creature. He's also individual person.Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13).(pause) So have we finished our walking? Not yet?"
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Excuse me?,Prabhupāda,"All right, one round more."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):...(unclear)... flower?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, no flavor?"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):No, they bloom in the springtime.",Prabhupāda,It is just like a beautiful man without any qualification.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Ah! No scent.,Prabhupāda,No scent.
Guru,"Gurudāsa:Is that a qualification, is that part of the age ofKali-yuga? Flowers with no scent?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Trees will have no fruits. The fruit will have no juice. That is mentioned. Just like in a mango there is a seed. In many fruits there is seed. InKali-yugayou'll find simply the skin and seed, no pulp. And cloud without rain. These are mentioned. (laughs) What can you do? If the cloud becomes without rain, if the fruit become without pulp, if the paddy becomes without grain, then what you have to eat? You have to eat the grass, the husk, the skin, and the seed. Or kill another man and eat. Just like in Africa, still, they are doing. Cannibals. Killing the grandfather, that is a great ceremony. Do you know that?"
Guru,Gurudāsa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"They kill the grandfather and have a feast, the cannibals. Yes. That is a great sport, that the grandsons will kill the grandfather and have a feast on his body by toasting.(?) Yes. The same idea is being preached by the communists. They want that all old man of the society, they should be killed. That is one of the theories put forward by the communists. Because they are not producing anything. So just imagine, these things will come gradually. So better to leave this place as soon as possible. Not to come again. That should be our serious attention. The other day the radio man was asking, ""Swamiji, how to adjust?"" ""And there is no adjustment. You have to go out of the scene. There is no adjustment."" So he was not very happy. If I would have bluffed him, ""Oh, you do this, you do that, you do this humanitarian work, you spread(?) education and give foodstuff."" No! There is no adjustment. The only adjustment is quit this place. That is the function of this human form of life. You can get out of this show byKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Kṛṣṇasays that this is the abode of miseries and that also temporary. Because you can accept any miserable life. That is the spell ofmāyā.Just like this dog life. If somebody asked me, ""Would you like to be a dog? I can make you,"" shall I agree? Why not? Because I know that's miserable life. But the dog is satisfied. By becoming a purchased slave, very much satisfied. He has no independence, always chained and always servant, eternal servant of a particular man. He can do any harmful thing by the order of the master, he's so faithful. But still, his life is miserable because he's dog. But he is satisfied. He thinks that ""Oh, it is a very nice life."" This is called covering power ofmāyā,illusion. Anyone in the most miserable condition of life he'll think, ""Oh, I am very happy."" Ask him, ""How are you?"" ""Oh, very nice. Very nice."" So there is no adjustment. AKṛṣṇaconscious person should... He knows that here only adjustment is to live inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is the only... If he's materially conscious... What is the difference between materially conscious man andKṛṣṇaconscious man? Materially conscious person is thinking everything as his property or enjoyable thing. AndKṛṣṇaconscious person is seeing the same thing as Kṛṣṇa's. A materially conscious person is satisfied, you get him a nice aromatic flower for his personal enjoyment, andKṛṣṇaconscious person he at once thinks, ""It is very nice flower, it should be offered toKṛṣṇa."" The flower is there, he is there, the consciousness is changed, that's all. He's thinking everything in relationship withKṛṣṇa. Here the man, distributing food to the animals and fish, he's thinking that ""I am doing some pious activities and I shall enjoy the fruit of it."" And that's a fact. But if we distributeKṛṣṇaprasādam,we think that ""This man is being suppliedKṛṣṇaprasādam,one day he may becomeKṛṣṇaconscious."" There is no personal question. And the principle of distributingKṛṣṇaprasādamis there. Therefore even they don't say any charge, if you distribute theprasādam,if you are able, you are doing some service. Because by eating only, he shall one day becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. So whole program is forKṛṣṇa. And that isKṛṣṇakarma.(?) You are preparing, you are earning money, you are distributingprasādam.Why? For Kṛṣṇa's sake. Otherwise, why should you work so hard? But we have voluntarily accepted, ""Oh,Kṛṣṇawill be satisfied."" This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Samsiddhirhari-tosanam.Everyone may act in his own duty. It doesn't matter what kind of duty he has got. But he has to see whether by execution of that dutyKṛṣṇais satisfied. Then he's successful. That is the version in theSrimad-Bhāgavatam:"
