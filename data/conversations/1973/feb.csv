Devotee:,Devotee:...māmevaiṣyasi yuktvaivamātmānaṁmat-parāyanaḥ.,Prabhupāda,(indistinct)
Devotee:,Devotee:Again?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, go on, read the purport."
Devotee:,"Devotee:""Translation: Engage your mind always in thinking of Me. Offer obeisances and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you'll come to Me.""",Prabhupāda,"So this is the process. Says, ""Always think of Me."" (speaks Hindi to guest for some minutes) This is the translation. Read the purport. Purport."
Devotee:,"Devotee:""Purport: In this verse it is clearly indicated thatKṛṣṇaconsciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Kṛṣṇa. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's mind andKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇais not an ordinary human being. He's Absolute Truth. His body...""",Prabhupāda,"Just like Dr. Radhakrishnan. He has explained this verse... WhenKṛṣṇasaysman-manābhavamad-bhaktaḥ,he comments, ""It is not to the personKṛṣṇa."" Just see.Kṛṣṇasaysman-manā,""Always think of Me."" And he, out of his so-called nonsense scholarship, he says, ""It is not toKṛṣṇa."" (Hindi)"
Guest (1) Indian man:,Guest (1) Indian man:He's impersonalist. I read thatBhagavad-gītāin school.,Prabhupāda,He's a nonsense. He's a nonsense. Now he's suffering. I saw him last year in Madras. He has lost his brain. He's suffering now. You cannot ask him whether he's hungry or whether he wants some... Only his daughter is attending and here he cannot understand who is standing before him. He cannot speak. Like that. (Hindi) He has committed so much offenses under the lotus feet ofKṛṣṇa. (Hindi for some minutes) ...very meritorious. I think you cannot understand Hindi.
Devotee:,Devotee:He speaks English.,Prabhupāda,"Ah. So you can understand English then. So (Sanskrit).Duṣkṛtinaḥmeans...kṛtiḥmeans meritorious, very meritorious. Butduṣkṛtiḥ.Whatever merit he has got... Nowadays at the present moment the civilization is somadthat everyone as human being... Any human being he has got some merit because he is not cat and dog. He's a man. As a man he has got brain, better than the cats and dogs. That's a fact. And actually they're doing so many things. Just like this picture. It is a very meritorious workmanship. So everyone can do some meritorious workmanship. But when that workmanship is diverted to, for the use of sinful activities... Just like one man is very meritorious, he's planning to form a party how to plunder. This requires merit. Without merit you cannot form a party. But the merit is being used for plundering, for harassing, for so many other sinful activities. So that is calledduṣkṛtinaḥ.Merit is there but the merit is being misused for sinful activities. Thereforeduṣkṛtiḥ.Just like modern scientist. It is meritorious that they have discovered the atomic bomb. The merit is used for killing. If you just use your merit so that man may live; that they're dying. Everyone is dying. So you have discovered a bomb which will accelerate death. Death, everyone is going to die. So if you manufacture something which will actually help my death, is that very meritorious? If you discover something that will stop my death, that is meritorious. But everyone is dying and you have discovered some machine so that you can die quickly. What is the merit? But people are appreciating, ""Oh, this is meritorious."" This is calledduṣkṛtiḥ. Duṣkṛtiḥ,mean one has got merit, it is being spoiled for doing something wrong. This is calledduṣkṛtiḥ.So such people,duṣkṛtinaḥ,who, one who is using the merit for sinful activities, he cannot understandKṛṣṇa. He cannot surrender toKṛṣṇa.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥ[Bg.7.15] and rascal. Rascal means denying the existence of God. He's a rascal. Anyone who denies the existence of God, he's a rascal. Rascal means poor fund of knowledge. Everything... Suppose this is a country, Indonesia, nicely being managed; the roads are there; the policemen there, they're directing... Just yesterday we were trying to enter in a one way, policeman directs. So this symptom says that there is a good government. So any sane man, he'll see the cosmic manifestation—that the sun is rising exactly in time; the moon is rising exactly in time; the seasons are changing; the seas is in its position. Just like the Pacific Ocean at any moment it can overflow at any place. But it does not do so. You walk... I was walking in Los Angeles just about three feet away from the sea. So I was explaining to my students, ""Now, I am just three feet away from the sea and the sea is so vast. At any second it can overflood us. But why you are confident the sea will not come here?"" Because we know, by God's order, although the sea, the ocean, is so big, it cannot violate the order of God. That you are big, that's all right. But you cannot come beyond this line. So these things are being managed. And there is no God? What a nonsense. If things are... Just like when you pass through a house, sometimes if you don't see—the house is not properly taken care of, or there is no light in front of the house, there are so many garbages, we immediately say, ""Oh, there is no man in this house."" And as soon as you see house is very nicely kept, there is light and the garden is kept, we understand there is a man. So this is common sense. If things are going on, everything is going on so nicely, how you can say there is no management, there is no brain? How you can say? What is this nonsense? How you can say there is no God?Asatyamapratiṣṭhaṁtejagad āhuranīśvaram[Bg.16.8].These are the rascal, atheist proposition,asatyam.There is no proof in it. Zero. From zero it has come. Just see nonsense. Does anything come out of zero? You assemble zero, many millions of zero in one place, but still it is zero. Do you think that if you make zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, million times, has it any value? How do they conclude from zero such a management, cosmic manifestation has come? The flower is coming out nicely in its own way. The tree is coming. Human being is coming. Everything is in order. And there is no management. How much rascaldom. Just see. So these atheist class, they're rascals,mūḍhāḥ,third-class men without any knowledge.Namāṁduṣkṛtinaḥ.I've already explained. Using the merit for sinful activities, they're calledduṣkṛtiḥ.Andmūḍhāḥ,these rascals, who cannot understand how the management is going on,mūḍhāḥ.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥ,prapadyantenarādhamāḥ[Bg.7.15].Narādhamāḥmeans...Narameans human being.Adhamameans the lowest, because the lowest of the mankind. The highest of the mankind means who has the knowledge of the Supreme. He's called highest,brāhmaṇa.Brahma-jānāti,one who knowsBrahman. He's called highest. And the lowest means that he has got this body, human form of body, but he is acting like animal. Just like cats and dogs, they cannot understand what is God. So any person who is not understanding, or trying to understand what is God, he's the lowest of the mankind. Because in the human form of life, it is the chance to understand what is God, but he's misusing it. He's using this body just like cats and dogs. They eat, sleep, have sex intercourse, and die. So these things are there. But if somebody argues that you are saying lowest of the mankind but we see so many Dr. Radhakrishnans, they also do not admit. Therefore the word is used,māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.They appear to be very highly learned scholars but their real knowledge has been taken bymāyā. Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ. Āsuri-bhāva.Why he can remain so? Becauseāsuri-bhāva,there is no God. That is their determination. There is no God. Therefore their merit is being misused, they have become the lowest of the mankind. They have become the Fool No. 1 and all that so-called education, academics, knowledge has been taken away bymāyā.This is... So we test only whether he's a devotee of God. If he's not a devotee of God then we take either of these: he must be the rascal, or lowest of the mankind, or simply using the merit for sinful activities, or his knowledge has been taken away bymāyā.Immediately, we have no difficulty to understand what class of man he is. The test is whether he has got any sense of understanding God. If not then he comes to this group. It is not very difficult to study man, what he is. We have got the formula in theBhagavad-gītā.(Hindi)"
Devotee:,"Devotee:Your explanation you've just given was so clear, Prabhupāda. We can easily see. It's so clear.",Prabhupāda,"(chuckling) Yes, this is the explanation. There is no second explanation.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥprapadyantenarādhamāḥ[Bg.7.15].This is the only explanation. What explanation can you... Who can give another explanation? There is no second explanation.Bhagavad-bhakti-hīnasyajātiḥśāstraṁjapastapaḥ, aprāṇasyevadehasyamaṇḍanaṁloka-rañjanam.It's like if you decorate the dead body. It may be pleasing to some relatives of the dead body, otherwise what is the value of it? Others will think, ""What a foolish man, he is, that decorating the dea..."" Suppose if there is dead body and you're decorating (indistinct) flower. That may be your sentiment because the dead body belongs to your father or mother, like that. It is pleasing to you, but actually what is the value? So similarly, this human civilization is meant for understanding God. If that sense is lacking then it is simply decoration of the dead body. That's all. There is no value."

Guest (1):,"Guest (1):He's nice devotee of Lord ŚrīKṛṣṇa. I remember many years ago, I met him in Surbaya. He used to preach onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,but in Sindi language.",Prabhupāda,Very good.

(hums softly) What is your philosophy of life?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What do you mean?,Prabhupāda,"Philosophy means why you are working, why you are living, what is the purpose."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):We are working for (indistinct), I have been working also. We just follow the same tradition.",Prabhupāda,"Still there must some why. Why your forefathers they work and they die? So do you think that is the only philosophy, to work and die? That is being done by the animals also. They work and die."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. First thing is, why you are working? What is the purpose of working? If the purpose of working is to work hard and then die, finished, then where is the difference between the animals and the men? They are also working. They are dying, too. Cats, dogs, hogs. Then after some time they die without knowing the purpose of life. Then where is the difference between cats, dogs, hogs and (indistinct) human beings. This question does not arise in the modern civilization. And one is thinking, ""Yes, it is the same."" But they're lying on the street, we're lying on a very nice apartment, bedstead. This is our profit."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Śrīla Prabhupāda, it will take about a half hour to get the puffed rice.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Then you give me, little fruit or..."
Devotee:,Devotee:Fruits?,Prabhupāda,You have got that sliced? Bread sliced? No.
Devotee:,"Devotee:Slices of bread, I have them here.",Prabhupāda,The last one.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What bread is that?,Prabhupāda,(Hindi) In Bombay it is very... Somebody told me that he made at his home. They do it at home.
Devotee:,Devotee:I think it's called rice.,Prabhupāda,"Rice, yes. In Bengali we callmuḍi.It is very popular, staple food for ordinary, everyone. In Bengal village, it is very popular because they're rice eaters. From rice they make this puffed rice. So they taking it in the morning. Puffed rice, mixed with molasses and cheese. It makes very good combination. Similarly... Puffed rice must be there, and fruits, like mango, banana, little molasses, and cheese mixed together. It is very nice. (indistinct) This jackfruit... Puffed rice is the vehicle for eating all this. Or if these things are not available, then mix with ghee, little and salt, pepper and, what is called? Cucumber."

Guest (1):,Guest (1):Channawe have.,Prabhupāda,"No.Channa.That is calledchaval.Puffed rice meanschaval.From grains we have got varieties of foods. Grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, you can make at least four hundred, five hundred varieties."

Devotee:,Devotee:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, thank you very much. (to guest:) You don't take charge of that."
Devotee:,"Devotee:We will take that. [break] Yes. This is Mr. Ivy Mastram and he is in charge of theHinduand Buddhist Department of the Department of Religion. And this is his next-in-command, director-general, Mr. G.Puja. He was educated in India also.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, really. Which city?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Benares (indistinct) University.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, Benares University."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Actually, they have arranged by giving a letter, that we can stay in the country. They simply say, ""We do not object,"" and then the immigration gives us a goodvisa. They especially like your books.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, thank you. You have read some of my books?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"They are not my books. I am simply translating. They are written by Vyāsadeva, the original Vedic scholar. So there are now many secular states. Our Vedic idea of secular state is the government must be responsible of proper execution of religious system. It doesn't matter whether one isHinduor one is Christian, one is Mohammedan or Buddhist. It doesn't matter. But it is a government duty to see that one who is professing asHinduwhether he's executing theHinduprinciples of religion properly. That is government. Just like government gives license to so many businesses. One man is selling liquor, wine, government issues license. So the government inspector, excise inspector, goes and sees that the man is doing business according to the license. Government should not be callous that ""You may go on with your so-called religion, we don't care for it."" No. That is not government. Government's duty is to see, just like for example, Christians, their commandment, first commandment is, ""Thou shalt not kill."" It is the government's duty to see that anyone who is professing Christian, ""Why he's killing?"" Immediately he should be punished that ""You are professing as Christian and you are killing."" This is government. Similarly, Buddhist religion also,ahiṁsā.Ahiṁsāparamaṁbuddhiḥ.The government duty should see. And the ultimate test of first-class religion is: the follower has developed love of God. If he does not know anything about God, or if he has not developed love of God, then he has simply wasted time. It may be any religion. That is ultimate test because religion means, it has got relationship with God. Otherwise what is the meaning of religion? Any religion, it doesn't matter. The process should be quest of God. What is God? What is Absolute Truth? Wherefrom everything has come? What is we... what we are? What is our relationship with God? This science. Religion means this science. In theVedānta-sūtra,it is said,athātobrahmajijñāsā.This human life is meant for understanding the Absolute Truth. Otherwise, what is the difference between cats and dogs and human beings? If simply eating, sleeping, and sex life, and defend is the business of human life, then these things are there in the animal life also. They also eat. They also sleep. They have also sex life, and they also defend according to their capacity. We defend with atomic bomb and they defend their own nails and claws. The different spirit is there. So that is not the aim of human life. The aim of human life—this opportunity's given by nature to have a human form of life—is to understand God. Nobody can deny—unless he is a crazy fellow—the existence of God. That is not possible. There must be. I may know it or not know it, it doesn't matter. Therefore religion means to understand God and to awaken your dormant love for God. This is religion. Now there may be difference of process, according to country, time, people. Therefore, it is the duty of the government, it is the duty of the government...HareKṛṣṇa(someone enters). Formerly the kings, they were regularly supervising that their citizens were properly executing religious culture. That was government's duty.Cātur-varṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭaṁguṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ[Bg.4.13].So now government is callous about religion. I'm very glad to know that your government has left some department to supervise. What is your function in this department?"
Devotee:,Devotee:He would like to have him translate English to Indonesian.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):He is the director of the (indistinct) ofHinduand Buddhist religion, from Department of Religious Affairs. His duty is to maintain and look after the development of (indistinct) expecting that all people of Indonesia that has to follow any kind of religions (indistinct) Christians, because we have also in charge for the Christianity, we have also in charge for the Muslim, or Islam, and we have also in charge for the Catholic and we have also in charge for other...",Prabhupāda,Very good idea. This is very nice.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):So because we have so many in the prosecuting of their religions, there might be, the people between many religions (indistinct). So the government have to lead the people how (indistinct), to supply also, in the (indistinct) of their materials for readings, and facilities for their, prosecuting their religions. This is the actual (indistinct) department.",Prabhupāda,So this is the idea which I was explaining that...
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):(Indonesian) As a matter of fact, also that we are looking from theHinduand Buddhist religions' point of view, how to get (indistinct) this department, especially because we are feeling of lacking of materials because no of our books actually here, written in ancient Indonesian language, which are translated from Sanskrit (indistinct)",Prabhupāda,Ancient English...?
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Ancient Indonesian language.,Prabhupāda,Ācchā.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):And now actually, most of the Sanskrit texts also, are not available anymore. Of course we have some few can be available from (indistinct) and that is why actually, to develop this new religions, as well as the Buddhist religion, which have a lack of material for reading. Now the government also tried to rewrite into Indonesianbhāṣā,and as one of the aspects, for example, thatBhagavad-gītāhas been translated into Indonesian.",Prabhupāda,Mmmm.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Which we are expecting that thisBhagavad-gītāshould be read by English (indistinct) and also, matter of fact, most of English readers can understand and they have the ideas of theMahābhārata,andRāmāyaṇa,and the essence of theBhagavad-gītā.Now the problems, at least the department has (indistinct) facing difficulties to supply materials that are actually needed by the people, is we are lacking of materials. So how, actually we have to solve this problem actually. We are actually, from the government point of view always looking and how we can try to get international relationships between various countries to solve the problems. As the same case also how to educate Indonesian peoples to study more about the Hinduism in order they can teach the Hinduism because in our country religious instruction is compulsory in our, any institution. So we felt, actually in our lack of material as well as lack of institution to develop thisHindureligions. And I, from our government actually, we are expected your visit here that it will be beneficial, both for our side, from the government point of view, and as well as for here and as well in your country.",Prabhupāda,So I think your problems can be solved if you kindly cooperate with us.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes. That's why we are looking for... because...,Prabhupāda,We can give you correct idea of religious principles as well as our philosophy.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Religious idea without philosophy is sentiment, and philosophy without religion is mental speculation. They should be combined. Religious idea supported by philosophy. Then it is correct. And philosophy without religious idea is simply mental speculation. They should be combined. That combination of religious idea and philosophy, you'll find in theBhagavad-gītā,provided you acceptBhagavad-gītāas it is. If you interpretBhagavad-gītāin your own way, then you'll miss the point. Just like in our country, in India,Bhagavad-gītāhas been interpreted in so different ways that people are now bewildered. They do not know what is actuallyBhagavad-gītā.Take, for example... Just like in the beginning of theBhagavad-gītā,it is said,dharmakṣetrekurukṣetresamavetāyuyutsavaḥ[Bg.1.1].I think you know Sanskrit.Samavetāyuyutsavaḥmāmakāḥpāṇḍavāś caivakimakurvatasañjaya[Bg.1.1].Even a great leader, political leader, he has interpretedkurukṣetraas this body. So where is the dictionary wherekurukṣetrameans this body? But because he's a big political leader thatgītāis going on.Kurukṣetrameans this body.Pāṇḍavameans the five senses. In this way [break] ...they cannot (indistinct) I may tell you frankly. Just likeMahatmaGandhi, he wanted to prove nonviolence fromBhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītāis spoken in the battlefield, and how he can prove nonviolence fromBhagavad-gītā?Then he has to drag some interpretation out of his own way. But because he's a big leader the people are misled. Similarly, all... at present moment in India theBhagavad-gītāhas becoming a plaything that anyone can interpret in his own way and do all nonsense. But I'll request you, because you are so much interested, and you have already approvedBhagavad-gītā,you have translated. Amongst the leading personalities, you try to understandBhagavad-gītāas it is and spread it, it will have immediate effect. That is already experimented. Just like in western countries, before me, hundreds and thousands, swamis and yogis went there. But not a single person could understand what isBhagavad-gītā,and what isKṛṣṇa. Now hundreds and thousands of these boys in Europe, America, Canada, Africa, everywhere, Australia, everywhere, they are now become devotees... So they're intelligent persons, they're coming from rich family. Why they have taken seriously? Because they have understoodBhagavad-gītānicely. So I request that God is neither Indonesian, neither Indian, neither African, God is God. And He claims that all living entities, in any form... The form is superficial. The form is taken as dress. Just like you are dressed in a different way, I am dressed in a different way. But we are not talking to the dress, we are talking to the man who is putting on the dress. Similarly, this bodily distinction is material. But spiritually we are all one. There is no question of becoming Indian or Indonesian or African or Asian or this or that. And that is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.You know.Paṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ.Vidyā-vinaya-sampannebrāhmaṇegavihastiniśunicaivaśvapākecapaṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18].Becausepaṇḍitadoes not see the outward dress,paṇḍitasees the inside, who is putting on the dress. Therefore, without misinterpretingBhagavad-gītā,or being misled by so-called big, big leaders, if you try to understandBhagavad-gītāas it is, it will be very nice, beneficial to everyone. That is my, not opinion, but is the fact. Things should be taken as it is. Call a spade a spade. Now, interpretation is required when things are not clear. When things are not very clear, not easily understood... There is example in Sanskrit grammar,gaṅgāyāṁghoṣabali(?). The neighborhood ofghoṣafamily is on the Ganges. Now, on the Ganges-Ganges is water—how there can be a village? Now, here interpretation required. When the matter is [break] ...on the water but on the bank of the Ganges. So when the meaning is not clear, then you can interpret. But when the meaning is clear... Just likeBhagavad-gītā: dharmakṣetrekurukṣetresamavetāyuyutsavaḥ[Bg.1.1].NowKurukṣetrais still there, in..., about 90 miles away from Delhi. Perhaps you have been there. The station is there,Kurukṣetra. Now how one can interpret thatkurukṣetrameans this body? This is going on. In spite of clear understanding, they interpret in their own way so that they have got their own philosophy, they want to support. This is going on. So if you kindly avoid this misleading interpretation, and if you takeBhagavad-gītāas it is, then you get the science of God, science of religion, which is applicable either to Indonesian or Indian or African or American, everyone. The science is appreciated everywhere. Two plus two equal to four, this mathematical science is applicable everywhere. It doesn't matter whether one is a Christian orHinduor Muslim. Similarly,Bhagavad-gītāis the science of religion, science of God. So if you take this book seriously, and try to spread this knowledge among your countrymen, I think you'll be very much benefited. And it can be... We are preaching that. We are the, ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, is meant for one God, one scripture, onemantra,like that, for all people of the world.

Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes. He has read it.,Prabhupāda,Very good.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):And I think many Indonesian people, actually have read thisBhagavad-gītābecause we have translated thatBhagavad-gītāin 1966.",Prabhupāda,"I see. Very nice. So have you read our, thisBhagavad-gītāAs It Is?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,You like it?
Guest (2):,Guest (2):(indistinct) because when I was in India (indistinct).,Prabhupāda,Prabhupāda;:So religion must be there. Without religion the human society is animal society. There must be religion. And religion means to know God. That is religion. What is your explanation of religion?
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Actually (indistinct) religion has to be defined as (indistinct),Prabhupāda,What is that (indistinct)
Guest (2): :,Guest (2): :(indistinct) to understand religion is (indistinct),Prabhupāda,":Yes. They must be the same.Dharmaṁtusākṣadbhagavat-praṇītam[SB6.3.19].Religion means the course, or the laws given by God. Just like law means the law given by the state. I cannot manufacture law. The citizen cannot manufacture law. The law is manufactured by the legislative assembly of the government. Similarly, religion means the order given by God. Now we have to understand who is God, and what is His order, and how it is applicable to everyone. That is the system of religion. We cannot whimsically give some rituals as religion. The principle of religion is to obey the orders of God. Therefore the first principle is to know who is God. Unless I know what is God, then how I can know what is His order? So in theBhagavad-gītā,the religion is given that—(Aside:) you are feeling sleepy, you can go—theBhagavad-gītā,it is said thatsarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].That is religion. We have manufactured so many types of religion, and here God says that ""You give up your manufactured religion. You just surrender unto Me."" This is religion. Religion means to surrender. A good citizen means to surrender to the government law. Similarly, a religious person means who has surrendered to God. Nowadays it has become a regrettable fashion that everyone is God, when we surrender to one. And this false prestige that ""I am God. I haven't got to surrender to anyone. I am God. What surrender?"" This atheism is going on and spoiling the whole human society. God has become so cheap. Any nonsense can claim, ""I am God."" That is the defect of the modern society. There is a great necessity to understand God. If everyone is God then where is the necessity of religion? If everyone is president then where is the necessity of lawmaking? So this is going on. This is very unfortunate situation. What is your idea?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):(indistinct) that in ourHindutext, for example, that when it's expressedahaṁbrahmāsmi,so...",Prabhupāda,"Ahaṁbrahmāsmiis the Vedic version, that is all right.Ahaṁbrahmāsmimeans, ""I am spirit. I am not this body.""So 'hammeans, ""I am the same quality as God."" But they are misinterpretation:So 'hammeans, ""I am God."" This is nonsense. This is going on."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):That's misleading.,Prabhupāda,Misleading. People have become nonsense. (conversation between the two Indonesian guests) You have publishedBhagavad-gītāwith commentary or simple translation?
Guest (2):,Guest (2):With commentaries.,Prabhupāda,So whose commentary you have followed?
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):We try to take from various books and we try, at first we have to understand clearly their positions, then we put them in a simple way that everybody can understand it clearly. Only the part that's very difficult to (indistinct).",Prabhupāda,"Now here,Bhagavad-gītā,in the Fourth Chapter it is said,imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam[Bg.4.1].You can open to the Fourth Chapter."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):(Indonesian) but according to our opinions that religion is something that true living.,Prabhupāda,Something?
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Something that we should live truly.,Prabhupāda,"True living. Yes. True, just like good citizens..."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):That's right.,Prabhupāda,"Good citizenship means living under the direction of the government. That is good citizenship. Similarly, human life means to live nicely under the direction of God. The cats and dogs, they cannot understand. But the human life, (pause) That first verse:imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam,vivasvānmanaveprāhamanurikṣvākave'bravīt[Bg.4.1].So what is your explanation of this verse?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):You want to explain this into er... Do you want to explain this?,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam,vivasvānmanaveprāhamanurikṣvākave'bravīt[Bg.4.1]."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Yes. This actually is explaining the origins of the law, ancient law, that's obeyed by the man. It's the law given from the Vedic literature...",Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇa.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes.Kṛṣṇa(indistinct) and coming toIkṣvākuand...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that (indistinct) means, that means this knowledge should be received from the authority."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,Just like...
Guest (2):,Guest (2):So actually they have acquired it from one source.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. One link. So that is being deviated. WhatKṛṣṇasaid toVivasvān, to the sun-god now everyone is speaking in his own way, not in that way."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):That's right.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore it is deviated. TheBhagavad-gītā, the Chapter, Fourth Chapter explains that you cannot understandBhagavad-gītāby your own interpretation. You must follow the instruction of the original speaker ofBhagavad-gītā. The original speaker isKṛṣṇa. So whatKṛṣṇasays, they have to follow it. Then it isBhagavad-gītā.Otherwise if you interpret it in a different way then it is notBhagavad-gītā.Now, whatKṛṣṇasays we have to understand it philosophically, ethically, scientifically, any way, any angle of vision. That is, that you can do. But you cannot change the version ofBhagavad-gītā.You cannot change. Just like Dr. Rādhākrishnan, in the Ninth Chapter whenKṛṣṇasays,man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65].Dr. Rādhākrishnan says ""It is not to theKṛṣṇaperson."" ButKṛṣṇaperson says,man-manābhavamad-bhaktaḥ,""You just always think of Me."" And he's deviating his readers, ""Not toKṛṣṇa."" How much harm he's doing. This is going on. Why? It is said,Kṛṣṇasays,man-manābhavamad-bhaktaḥ,""Just think of Me. Just become my devotee."" What right he has got to say that here it is not toKṛṣṇa? This is going on. So if we interpret in that nonsense way then we shall not be able to understandBhagavad-gītā.We shall miss this point. Science does not mean that you have to change according to your whims. Two plus two equal to four. You cannot make it five or three. That is not possible. Then it is not science. No longer the scientific value of this two plus two remains. We follow that principle, and that is the only principle. So if you're actually serious aboutBhagavad-gītā,I do not know what is your commentary. I request you, ""Try to follow the instruction ofKṛṣṇa. Don't interpret in your own way. Then it will be (indistinct)."" Everyone has got (indistinct) all over the world. Therefore we are selling thisBhagavad-gītāAs It Isvery nicely. Our publisher's MacMillan Co. and their trades managers report is that ourBhagavad-gītāis increasing daily, sales, other decreasing. That is the report, and in October they published 50,000 copies, it is already finished. Now they have to plan it for the second edition. People are very much now, eager to readBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.So, imitating us, somebody's, another (chuckles) man, he said""Bhagavad-gītāAs It Was."" (laughs with everyone) Like that. So that will not harm our cause."

We are not enjoyer. But God is Enjoyer. That God is the Proprietor of everything. Not we are proprietor. We are subordinate. In the <span class=""Italic"">Vedas</span> also, it is stated, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/eko"" class=""d"">eko</a> <a href=""/d/bahunam"" class=""d"">bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745;</a> yo <a href=""/d/vidadhati"" class=""d"">vidadh&#257;ti</a> <a href=""/d/kaman"" class=""d"">k&#257;m&#257;n</a>, nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m. <a href=""/d/eko"" class=""d"">Eko</a> <a href=""/d/bahunam"" class=""d"">bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745;</a> yo <a href=""/d/vidadhati"" class=""d"">vidadh&#257;ti</a> <a href=""/d/kaman"" class=""d"">k&#257;m&#257;n</a></span> (<span class=""Ref_Italic""></B><a href=""/d/katha"" class=""d"">Ka&#7789;ha</a> <a href=""/d/upanisad"" class=""d"">Upani&#7779;ad</a></span></B> 2.2.13)<span class=""Italic"">.</span> The description of God is like that He's eternal amongst the eternals. We are also eternal, the living entities. And God is also eternal. <span class=""Italic"">Nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745;... <a href=""/d/cetana"" class=""d"">cetana</a>,</span> He's the vital living force among all living forces. We are all living forces and He's the chief living force. Then what is the distinction between this singular number, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/nitya"" class=""d"">nitya</a>,</span> and the plural number, <span class=""Italic"">nityas?</span> The distinction is that that singular number, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/nitya"" class=""d"">nitya</a>,</span> is maintaining this plural number, <span class=""Italic"">nityas. <a href=""/d/eko"" class=""d"">Eko</a> <a href=""/d/bahunam"" class=""d"">bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745;</a> yo <a href=""/d/vidadhati"" class=""d"">vidadh&#257;ti</a> <a href=""/d/kaman"" class=""d"">k&#257;m&#257;n</a>. </span>That is the distinction. Otherwise God is also a living entity like us, like one of us. But he's the chief. Just like father and children. Father is the chief man in the family and he's providing all necessities to life for the children, for the wife (indistinct). Although the father is also living entity and the children are also living entities, but the father is providing the children, and the children are being provided by the father. So this is the understanding. Unless we understand this, there cannot be any peace. That is the Vedic version. Anyone who understands this, he gets peace. Otherwise there's no possibility of peace. If I think that I am the proprietor, if I think that I am the enjoyer, or, in other words, I am God, then you'll never get peace. That is not possible. That is a false. If one of the children thinks that I am the independent, then naturally father will say, ""All right, if you're independent, do your own business."" This is an example. So if you want peace then, as it is stated in the <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> you have to learn these three things. It is not very difficult. To accept God as the Supreme Enjoyer, and God as the sole proprietor of everything, and He's the best friend of everyone. Then you have peace. Anyone can appreciate this. Anyone can adopt this principle and he'll be in peace. And so long one will falsely think that ""I am God. I am enjoyer, I am this, I am that."" Then he'll suffer. False notion will never make him happy. He must come to the true, factual idea. Now you can examine that <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says that ""I am the Supreme Enjoyer."" Now let us understand this one fact, how K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's the enjoyer. Now suppose here is some banana fruits. Who has created this banana fruit? You are not manufacturer, I am not manufacturer. Somebody has created. We accept God has created and that's a fact. Then who should be the enjoyer? I shall be enjoyer or God shall be enjoyer? Anything you create, you become the enjoyer. Anything I create, I become the enjoyer. So if God has created this banana fruit, then who should be enjoyer? God or I?</div>

A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span>, illusion, due to the desire to lord it over <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a>.</span> And that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while he is in the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is free from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on ones practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And attaining <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness by controlling the above mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage of <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahma"" class=""d"">brahma</a>-<a href=""/d/nirvana"" class=""d"">nirv&#257;&#7751;a</a>.</span> The eight-fold <a href=""/d/yoga"" class=""d"">yoga</a> mysticism is automatically practiced in <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served.

They are misled. They're being misled. Misled in this way, that this human form of life is specially meant for understanding God. The animals are not very (indistinct), but the present leaders they're keeping all the human being in the animal condition of life. Their chance of becoming conscious about God is being sacrificed, being misled, by so-called economic development, plans. All this economic development means, they're meant for this bodily comforts. Any department of knowledge at the present moment, they're simply aiming at giving some artificial comfort to this body. But these rascals, they do not care to know that however I keep this body comfortably, I'll have to give it up. And after giving up this body, what is my next position, they do not know. They do not know. This is darkness. This is darkness. So this <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement is an educational movement to give enlightenment to the people at large, to understand the values of life. Not to live like animals, eating, sleeping, sex life and dying. This is animal life. This is the best humanitarian welfare activities: to make people understand scientifically what he is, what is God, what is our relationship with God. So the <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is the preliminary study of this science. So this should be presented very scientifically. One who knows perfectly well about this <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> These are the (indistinct) crucial point.
