Bali,BaliMardana:HṛdayānandaSwami.,Prabhupāda,"You, you were atheist?"
Hṛdayānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,So what is your view of atheist? What is your argument?
Hṛdayānanda,"Kīrtanānanda, his argument was, when he was an atheist, he said that actually the void is truth, and all categories or all varieties are illusion. So he said that we may think that actually spiritual variegatedness is transcendental, but that's actually also our illusion. That was his argument.",Prabhupāda,So what did you reply?
Hṛdayānanda,"I replied that if categories are illusion, then his talking is also illusion.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that's nice."
Hṛdayānanda,So I wouldn't let him say anything else.,Prabhupāda,"(laughs) Yes, very good reply. ""And you are also illusioned. Whatever nonsense you are talking, that is also illusion. Finish. Void, everything."" Then what did he reply?"
Hṛdayānanda,"He said... I just wouldn't let him say anything. Whenever he tried to talk, I just said, ""That's illusion."" [break]",Prabhupāda,"This reply we give to the Māyāvādīs. So we speak to theMāyāvādīguru, that ""Whether you are inmāyā?Because everything ismāyā,so whether you are also inmāyā?"" So if he says, ""Yes,"" then how he can becomeguru?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:ProfessorBharatisaid that. And when the students asked him, ""Isn't everything in this world illusion?"", he said, ""Yes, everything is illusion, but I like it very much.""",Prabhupāda,He likes it very much.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:That's what he said.,Prabhupāda,Therefore he is a rascal. That proves that he is a rascal.
Hṛdayānanda,"After that debate, many, many people have boughtBhagavad-gītās.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, then it is good triumph. Yes. (begins chantingjapa) [break] ...ponds like this, we remember immediately Bengal. Yes. In Bengal there are many, many ponds. (pause) What is called, this playing? What is this? Golf?"
Hṛdayānanda,Golf course.,Prabhupāda,They are coming for playing golfs?
Hṛdayānanda,They think that a gentleman should play golf.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is the fashion of the society."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:A man is considered very rich if he can play golf every day. The rich men play every day.,Prabhupāda,"It is very expensive, golf?"
Citraka:,"Citraka:...newspapers, that now he is follower of Śaṅkarācārya in India. The queen of Greece. She's a follower.",Prabhupāda,"Queen of Greece. This cloth is very inconvenient... [break] ...illusion. Accepting this illusion, wherefrom the idea came? Just like in the tailor's window, there are nice beautiful women or men standing. That is illusion. Actually, that is neither man or woman. It is doll. But wherefrom the idea came of this illusion?"
Hṛdayānanda,Kṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. Unless there is a real man, a real woman, how the illusory man and woman is there, doll? Illusion means which is not fact. So the fact must be there; otherwise how the illusion, reflection, comes? Illusion is exemplified by the mirage, water in the desert. So the man is or the animal is running after water, but that is not water. This is illusion. But that does not mean there is no water. This is the conclusion. Unless there is real water, how... (aside) You can give around here. How this illusion of water is there?"
Bali,BaliMardana:Does that mean it is not possible to conceive of something that does not exist somewhere?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is the real fact."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Some of them say thatBrahmancreates illusion to forget that he isBrahman. They say thatBrahman,the one, creates illusion to forget that he'sBrahman. That's hislīlā.",Prabhupāda,It islīlā.Then you have to accept thatBrahmanis a person.
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Well, they say there is only one person. There's no varieties of persons.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. But you have to accept the origin, the person. That is our philosophy. Then you accept our philosophy."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Then they say, ""Well it's not exactly a person, it's inconceivable.""",Prabhupāda,"Therefore you cannot say that He is not a person, because He is inconceivable. You cannot say whether He is person or not person, because you are illusioned, and inconceivable... But why you are thinking that because you cannot say perfectly, everyone cannot say perfectly? You are thinking like that. Just like we have got experience: one body cannot say something, but the other can say. Practical experience. Just like this child cannot say something but the father can say."
Bali,BaliMardana:It's their envious attitude. They are envious.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. It is not the question of envious. Because you are thinking that He is inconceivable, because you cannot say... But how can you say that another person cannot say? There are so many things I do not know. That does not mean that somebody else does not know. You may not know. Your experience is not mature. But how you can say, ""Another person cannot have the experience""? So that is answered in theBhagavad-gītā, vedāhaṁ samatītāni,māṁtuvedanakaścana:[Bg.7.26] ""I know everything, but nobody knows Me."" There is the answer. So nobody knowsKṛṣṇa. That's a fact. ButKṛṣṇareveals Himself to the devotee. That is also said,teṣāṁsatata-yuktānām[Bg.10.10]."
Hṛdayānanda,All raining?,Prabhupāda,It may be rain water.
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Well, they fill it. Usually they fill it on Saturdays and Sundays.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, that is it."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They practice fishing.,Prabhupāda,Fishing?
Citraka:,Citraka:...open a temple in Greece?,Prabhupāda,"I would like to open temples in every village, every city, what to speak of Greece. But we haven't got sufficient men."
Citraka:,Citraka:I will translate the books later.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, then you can open. But alone... You can be assisted with some of our men. That's nice proposal. We want to open in every city, every village, village to village. So go this way or around the...?"
Citraka:,Citraka:Sometimes you have said that the Greek mythology comes from thePurāṇas.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, certainly. In Greece I think some people know of our movement. Because in the airport as soon as some young men saw us, they chanted ""HareKṛṣṇa!"" Yes. Maybe they are Europeans, but I had practical experience. [break] which..., that Park Avenue?"
Bali,BaliMardana:Wednesday they are having a meeting. Perhaps on Wednesday.,Prabhupāda,Wednesday. So you have to attend? No.
Bali,"BaliMardana:No, I don't have to attend. The lawyers attend. If I attend, it may ruin everything. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...one isyogi.Karmī,jñānī,yogiorbhakta.What is the difference betweenkarmīs, jñānīs,yogis andbhakta?"
Hṛdayānanda,"Karmīwants to enjoy the gross senses, thejñānīwants to enjoy the subtle mind, mental speculation, theyogiwants to manipulate the universe, mystic powers,...",Prabhupāda,Material power.
Hṛdayānanda,And a devotee has no material desires. (He wants) to serveKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And unless one is factually desireless, he cannot be happy. Thekarmī,jñānī,yogi, they are all full of desires. Therefore they are unhappy.Karmīsare the lowest of the unhappies,jñānīsare little advanced, yogis are little more advanced, and the perfection is thebhakta,devotees.Nadhanaṁnajanaṁnasundarīṁkavitāṁvājagad-īśakāmaye[Cc.Antya20.29,Śikṣāṣṭaka4].This isbhakta.[break]...siddhi-kāmīsakaliaśānta.Bhuktimeanskarmī,andmuktimeansjñānī.Andsiddhi,aṣṭa-siddhi,magic power, mystic power. That is calledsiddhi.Those who are practicingyoga, if they are actually yogis, they can haveaṣṭa-siddhi.Aṇimā, laghimā.They can become smaller than the smallest, heavier than the heaviest.Mahimā,prāpti.They can get anything they like. Ayogican get... Suppose if you want a pomegranate from Kabul, he will get immediately. Yes. That isyogi. As if he is snatching from the tree, yes.Prāpti-siddhi,īśitā.They can force their influence upon anyone.Īśitā,vaśitā.Yogis can hypnotize you. As he will say, you will act. As he will say, you will act. These yogis do that. They take something nonsense, ""Now take gold,"" and you will think it is gold. Just like magician do."
Hṛdayānanda,Hypnotist.,Prabhupāda,"Hypnotist. They create heaps of money, the magician, I have seen it, all false."
Hṛdayānanda,"Like in theBhāgavatam,Arjunasaid like money created by magic word.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes, yes.Prāpti-siddhi.Now we are flying by aeroplane. Ayogican fly without any instrument. As DurvāsāMuni, he went evenVaikuṇṭha-loka.NotVaikuṇṭha-loka.Within this planet, there is one planet where,Śvetadvīpa,LordViṣṇulives. He went there and saw LordViṣṇupersonally to request him to save him. He refused, ""No, I cannot. You go toAmbarīṣaMahārāja, beg pardon of him. If he pardons, then you will be saved."" So to a devotee, innocent devotee, he had to fall down on his lotus feet, ""Please save me."" So what is the power ofyogi?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Is the pure devotee more merciful thanKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,"Oh yes, yes. BecauseViṣṇucould not excuse him, but as soon as he came toMahārājaAmbarīṣa, fell down, and ""You take all my assets of pious activities. You be saved immediately."" That isVaiṣṇava.When he begged, humble, ""MahārājaAmbarīṣa, you save me, I am in danger."" ""Yes, you take all my pious activities' result. You be saved immediately."" That is devotee.Viṣṇurefused, ""No, I cannot give you protection."" Therefore he is more merciful, although he was attacked, he was harassed. Just likeArjuna.Arjunawas merciful, ""Let them enjoy. I don't want to kill them.""Kṛṣṇasaid, ""You must kill. You must kill. Why you are deviating from your path? You must kill."" Therefore he taught himBhagavad-gītā,just to induce him to kill. But he was merciful, ""No, they have done so much wrong to me, never mind. They are my relatives. I excuse. I don't want to fight."" Yes. This isBhagavad-gītā.You see?Arjunais more merciful thanKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇawanted to see them all killed because they were, I mean to say, offender to the devotee. Last time,Kṛṣṇasays, ""Arjuna, you fight or not fight, it is already settled. They are not going back home. They will be killed here. If you like, you take the credit. That's all. It is already settled."" ThenArjunaunderstood that ""My Lord is so persistent. (laughter) Why shall I resist Him? All right, I will do what He says."""
Bali,"BaliMardana:You are more merciful than any of them, Prabhupāda. You have come to the western countries.",Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇa. Yes,Vaiṣṇavais, if one man is realVaiṣṇava. Just like see Jesus Christ. It is said that he took everyone's sins and he was crucified. So how much merciful he is, just see. But these rascals have taken, that ""Let us go on committing sinful activities, and Christ has taken contract. He will suffer. And we shall do this."" Such rascals. You see. They say that ""Our Christian religion is so good that even we commit sinful acts, Christ will suffer, we shall not suffer."" Just see."
Bali,"BaliMardana:I was reading yesterday in theNewsweekthat now the priests, they are dating with women and having sex.",Prabhupāda,"They must have because they have no spiritual knowledge. Anyone who is not spiritually advanced, he cannot avoid the sex."
Hṛdayānanda,"You said yesterday,adānta-gobhiḥ.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Big, big yogis, they fell victim to sex.ViśvāmitraMuni, many other instances!Saubhari,SaubhariMuni. He was meditating within the water, and some fish just, what is called, licked up, his gender."
Bali,BaliMardana:Copulating.,Prabhupāda,"Copulating, yes. And he felt sex desire, that itching sensation.Kaṇḍūyanenakarayorivaduḥkha-duḥkham.Kaṇḍūyanammeans itching. It is actually itching. Theśāstrasays it iskaṇḍūyanam.Kaṇḍūyanammeans itching, the scratching, the itching.Kaṇḍūyanenakarayorivaduḥkha-duḥkham."
Devotee:,Devotee:Our scientist.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,Only one scientist.,Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa.Idaṁhipuṁsastapasaḥśrutasyavā[SB1.5.22].Feeling all right?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes. (indistinct) (pause) [break] Yes. I wanted to know the... So there are five kinds of air, material air, and the spirit soul is floating in the five kinds of air. I want to know these different functional activities of the five kinds of air.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that also we admit. There are five kinds of air.Prāṇa,apāna,like that. There are... By the yogis, by breathing exercise, they control the five kinds of air. So that also we admit."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:No, the scientists, they do not understand the five kinds of air.",Prabhupāda,"They do not know so many things. What they will understand? Because they do not understand, therefore it has to be rejected. They are fools. What do they understand? Superfluous. Simply they see something outward. Just like they see the tree, but what do they understand about the seed? What do they understand? The tree is coming from the seed, but what do they understand about the seed? They see the tree, that's all. Like a child sees the tree and ""Oh, it is a big tree."" But intelligent man sees the seed."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They also see that the original seed the embryo is, remains dormant.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. How it is made? That they do not know, how subtle things are being done... (aside) We can go this way. That is their ignorance. They do not know subtle things. Simply gross manifestation attracts their attention. That's all.Jaḍā-dṛṣṭi.It is calledjaḍā-dṛṣṭi,material vision. Nosukhā-dṛṣṭi.Every, every field, they have no finer introspection. Simply gross. They deal with gross things. Just like the same example: Here is a tree, but it is a fact, this tree has grown from a small seed. So what do they know about the seed, how it is manufactured, how it has got the potency of bringing out such a big tree? Not only that, in that seed there will be millions of fruits, and each fruit there will be millions of seeds, and each seed contains again millions of trees. Where is your science? Where is that potency?"
Devotee:,"Devotee:Is a seed conscious, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. Everything is conscious. First of all, even gross manifestation we cannot understand, what to speak of consciousness. That is different thing. According to our philosophy, everything has got consciousness. Just like this tree has got consciousness."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:The scientists also say that they have consciousness.,Prabhupāda,"But this tree's consciousness and my consciousness is different. My consciousness is developed. If you pinch on my body, my consciousness will be immediately protesting. But you cut, it will not protest. So consciousness is different. So there is nothing which has no consciousness, but it is a question of degree. It is a question of degree. The more the consciousness is covered, it is called material. The more the consciousness is developed, it is called spiritual. That is the difference between matter and spirit."
Hṛdayānanda,"Prabhupāda, that verse in theGītā,thatnityaḥsarva-gataḥsthāṇuḥ.That verse in theBhagavad-gītāthat living beings are everywhere.",Prabhupāda,"Yes,sarva-ga. Acalo 'yaṁ sthāṇursarva-gaḥ.Nitya.Nityaḥsthāṇur acalo 'yam.That is described. The seeds are everywhere. Just like they are trying to come out from this. You will find sometimes fracture, grass is coming. As soon as there is opportunity, they want to express the consciousness. Those who fall down...kṣīṇepuṇyepunaḥmartya-lokaṁviśanti.They come with waters, rain water, and falls down on the ground and become grass. Then gradually, evolution."
Hṛdayānanda,That's terrible.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Ā-brahma-bhuvanāllokāḥpunarāvartino...How subtle laws are working, what do they know the scientists? Therefore their so-called knowledge ismāyayāapahṛta-jñānāḥ,actual knowledge is taken away bymāyā.And they are thinking, ""I am very learned man, scholar."" But actual knowledge is taken away.māyayāapahṛta-jñānāḥ.Why?Āsuri-bhāva.They won't accept God. Therefore they are all fools. In spite of all these degrees, they are all fools. Therefore they cannot explain everything very nicely. ""In future we shall see."""
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They are saying that ""We are beginning to learn more and more...""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That means that you are fool. While you are in the process of learning, that means you are fool. Say directly that we are fool. That is gentlemanliness. You do not know; still, youpose, ""I am, we are scholar, we are scientist. Give us Nobel Prize."" You see. This is going on. We don't want Nobel Prize. We are giving the topmost knowledge. We don't hanker after Nobel Prize. But they give false knowledge and hanker after Nobel Prize. Just see. Their real aim is how to get the Nobel Prize by cheating. That is their real aim. How an educated man, learned man will cheat? So therefore myGuruMahārājaused to say that ""This modern human society, or always, it is a society of the cheaters and the cheated."" Somebody is cheating and somebody's cheated, and they have combined together to make a so-called civilization."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Prabhupāda, you know the scientist you quoted inEasy Journey?You quoted an article from the newspaper inEasy Journeyabout the two scientists who were studyinganti-matter?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Well, about a year ago another scientist came forward, and he charged that those two scientists actually stole the knowledge from him. They were working with him, and they stole it to win Nobel Prize.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, there are many scientists like that. Just like this Marconi, he stole the knowledge from Dr. JagadishaCandraBose. You know that?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:I have heard this.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. JagadishaCandra... I was present. He said that ""This man cheated me. I talked with him. Next morning he published the theory."""
Karandhara:,Karandhara:About radio?,Prabhupāda,"No, newspaper. Because both of them were friends, scientists, they talked. And he took the clue, immediately published the theory."
Bali,BaliMardana:Which theory was that?,Prabhupāda,That Marconi wireless.
Bali,"BaliMardana:Wireless, radio.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, radio. That was JagadishaCandraBose's discovery. But the government will not give the credit to the Indians. Because JagadishaCandraBose happened to be Indian. These Britishers they are so much envious. Therefore they will never admit thatBhagavad-gītāwas spoken five thousand years ago. They bring all within the Christian period. That is their rascaldom."
Jayādvaita:,"Jayādvaita:We went to a college and gave a class last week where the professor was saying that theBhagavad-gītāis only two thousand years old, like that.",Prabhupāda,Yes. They will never accept it.
Yaśomatīnandana:,Yaśomatīnandana:One stupid guy was saying that there is some quotation in theBhagavad-gītāfrom Book of John.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, that is another rascaldom.Tavacārjuna."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about the heart transplant? The spirit soul is within the heart, but when the... in the medical science nowadays, the old heart can be replaced by a new one. So what happens with the spirit soul with the old one?",Prabhupāda,But that does not mean that new ones will increase their duration of life. That is our challenge.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But the personality is changed?,Prabhupāda,No.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Why not?,Prabhupāda,"Why changed? Suppose if I sit from this chair to this chair, why I am changed? I can change my seat. It does not mean that I am changed."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Change the heart also. The heart can change.,Prabhupāda,"The heart is seat, sitting place."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But the new heart had spirit soul from the new one.,Prabhupāda,"Spirit soul, new or old there is. But if you can prove by changing the heart you can increase the duration of life, then you can catch the spirit soul."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:That they're not able to do.,Prabhupāda,That is their nonsense.
Bali,BaliMardana:None of them have lived very long.,Prabhupāda,"No, they cannot be. Because bykarmaṇādaiva-netreṇa[SB3.31.1],by superior arrangement,karmaṇā,you have got this body. So you have to live within this body certain age. So if you change the body, new, that doesn't mean you prolong your life. That is not possible. It is the duration of life, that is considered. They are thinking by changing the heart they will increase the duration of life. That is not possible."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So it is some sort of artificial transmigration?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, like that. That transmigration taken... That is already explained inBhagavad-gītā.Just like a baby becomes a child, child becomes boy, boy becomes youth, like that. Transmigration it is going on continually. This is another type of transmigration. So it is a fact that by changing the heart the duration is not...?"
Bali,"BaliMardana:No, most of them, they have lived, a very short times. But still is it a fact that the soul is transplanted from one body to another body?",Prabhupāda,"That can be done, yes. Sometimes yogis, they can perform that better body, he transfers himself into that body. Just Śaṅkarācārya did, yes."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:What they do, though, they wait till someone's dying or dead, and immediately after they die, they take the heart. From somebody who had the weak heart they transplant, change the heart.",Prabhupāda,So what...? There is no benefit.
Bali,BaliMardana:The soul has already left. [break],Prabhupāda,"...the soul is individual. As I told yesterday that dead body has got the ingredients to produce life. But that the man who has left his body, you cannot produce him. That is the proof of individuality. That is the proof of individuality.Huh?"
Bali,"BaliMardana:I was saying that they transplant the heart... After the first man, his soul has already gone, then they take his heart and put it into the other man, who has a weak heart. So all it means is that the soul is going from one heart to another heart, not that the soul, that they are taking the soul with it when they put the heart in.",Prabhupāda,He is destined to live in that body for a certain years. So you may change whatever you like.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:The heart is just an instrument in the machine.,Prabhupāda,Yes. It is a place.
Bali,BaliMardana:Now it's very clear. [break],Prabhupāda,"Karmaṇādaiva-netreṇajantur dehopapattaye[SB3.31.1].There is superior overlooking. That isKṛṣṇa,anumantā,upadraṣṭā.Upadraṣṭāanumantā."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:One man, Dr. Wyberg from South Africa, he was the first successful heart transplant. So as soon as he got out of the hospital he started drinking and having sex life. (laughter) He was saying, ""How wonderful science is. It can prolong my enjoyment."" Then he died about a year later from too much...",Prabhupāda,"That is material life. As soon as they get some opportunity, they will have sex. That is the only hope.Yanmaithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham[SB7.9.45].Here the only happiness is sex. Otherwise they are working so hard like asses. Why? Only for that sex. The only aim is ""I will enjoy sex at night."" That's all. That is the only aim.Yanmaithunādi.It is stated in theBhāgavata.Yanmaithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁhituccham.They are attracted with the most abominable thing, sex life. Yes.Tuccham.Tucchammeans very abominable, very insignificant thing. The position of the sex, the... How nasty it is! Just like crows, they enjoy in a nasty place. That is stated in theBhāgavata.Tadvāyasa-tīrtham.Vāyasameans crows. The crows, as they enjoy... [break]gṛhamandha-kūpam,ātma-pātam.As soon as you fall down, you are killed. You are killed. This example is given. That is stated inBhāgavata.When a woman comes to serve you, you must know it is covered well. As soon as you fall down, then you are finished.Hitvātma-pātaṁgṛhamandha-kūpaṁvanaṁgatoyaddharimāśrayeta[SB7.5.5].Therefore in the Vedic system firstbrahmacārī,becomebrahmacārī.Learn how to avoid sex, celibacy. That is first instruction. And if you are completely unable, all right, get yourself married. Otherwise there is no need of sex life. Why one should have sex life?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Then how to continue the species?,Prabhupāda,"Why you will continue? You finish it, this condemned world, where you are simply suffering. Why should you continue it?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Because that is the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda,"No, no, laws of nature if you want. If you want to be condemned, then laws of nature is there. Otherwise laws of nature is teaching you how to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. Just like police. Police business is to make you lawful. If you become lawful, there is no question of police. There is no question of police law.Daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14].Māyāis kicking you one after another so that you may come to sense that ""This life is not good."" But we are so foolish that we say, ""No, it is good.""Yanmaithunādi.""There is sex life. Oh, it is very good."" This is the position."
Hṛdayānanda,He said like putting gas on the fire.,Prabhupāda,"Ah. So increase the fire. Yes. But because we have got this body, we have to utilize it to make the best use of a bad bargain. Therefore marriage is allowed,gṛhasthalife is allowed, not for increasing sex life, but to finish it as soon as possible."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But, Śrīla Prabhupāda, even in the very lower forms of life, there are some species, they reproduce without any sex? It's called asexual reproduction.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. Oh yes. These bugs, bedbugs, they produce by this blood. You kill..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:We cannot check reproduction.,Prabhupāda,"No, how can you check? There are so many living entities. They have come to this material world to enjoy. So the reproduction must go on. Just like you cannot stop the jail. You come out, but another is ready to enter it. That is not possible."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So it is within this material platform that we develop the consciousness by which...,Prabhupāda,"That was answered byCaitanyaMahāprabhu. One of His devotee,VāsudevaDatta, he said, ""Sir, You have come. You take all the living entities of this universe and release them from this life. And if You think that they are so sinful, they cannot be, then give their all sins to me. But You take them."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""Suppose if I take this universe, the all living entities, do you think the business will be finished? This universe is just like a mustard seed in the bag of mustard seeds."" (laughs) So from the bag of mustard seeds, if you take one mustard seed, what is the loss there? So this cannot be stopped. Soanantāyakalpate.There are so many, unlimited number of living entities. So this will go on."
Yaśomatīnandana:,Yaśomatīnandana:You said in theBhāgavatamthat the material world is like a correction house for the living entity.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So everybody should developKṛṣṇaconsciousness.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. (Śrīla Prabhupāda gets into car)Kṛṣṇaconsciousness is the only remedy.Harernāmaharernāmaharernāmaevakevalam...[Cc. Ādi17.21].[break] And this advancement of material civilization means entrapping the entrapped.

Nowanityasaṁsāra,cannot live here. You have to give up this place. But still, you are thinking to make it a permanent settlement. That is not possible. Everyone knows. He will not be allowed to stay. But still insisting, gorgeous arrangement, how we can be, how we can become immortal. The scientists bluffing, ""Yes, you will become immortal. We are finding out the means."" But he will die.

He cannot live here, he cannot stay here, he cannot enjoy here. That's a fact. But he is being allured. That means he is becoming more and more ass. Ass because they are believing still, ""No, by scientific method, we shall do that, we shall do that. We shall cure all diseases. We shall live for good. There will be no more death. And we are happy."" That means you are becoming... This material advancement of knowledge means you are becoming more and more asses. [break] (end) What is the scientific question?Muḍhāḥ. Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ[Bg.7.15]."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:When they say about the, how one starts talking about the origin of life, they say that one should first of all consider how the earth was formed, how this planet earth where we live, how it was formed, what is the origin of the earth.",Prabhupāda,"Earth. Origin of earth is life. It is very simple to understand. Just like your body. Your body is... Or why your body? Take the tree. Tree is matter, it is earth. Wherefrom the big tree comes? From the life within the seed."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But they say that about 4.5 billion years ago this earth condensed in such a form, but before that there was no living entity because this earth was not suitable for it.",Prabhupāda,"That is rascal. No, no. You have got history for billions of years?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"What is that history? We have got history thatBrahmāwas the first creation, and fromBrahmā...Brahmācreated this universe."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They are saying that before, it was all gaseous dust particles and some gaseous materials which were floating and in due course it condensed and then it formed this...",Prabhupāda,So wherefrom the gas came? That they do not know.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yeah, they say it was just floating.",Prabhupāda,"Floating where. Wherefrom the sky came? They are all nonsense. Simply speculating and consuming cheap money from the government. That's all. This is their business. The government is exacting taxes from the hard-working men, and these rascals are devouring this money. That's all. And making theories. That's all."
Hṛdayānanda,There was one big scandal where they found out all the scientists were just taking money. Even by material standards it was unnecessary. It was a very big scandal.,Prabhupāda,It must be they are scandals. They are after money. That's all. Not after knowledge. And what knowledge they have got? Simply speculating and befooling other fools.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31].This is their business. One blind man is befooling other blind men. That's all.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They are very much convinced that this earth was gaseous. So there was no life at the beginning.,Prabhupāda,That may be. That may be that. But wherefrom the gas came?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:It was just existing.,Prabhupāda,"Bhinnāprakṛtiḥ.The answer is given.Bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥkhaṁmanobuddhiḥ[Bg.7.4].Vāyu,vāyugas, it came fromKṛṣṇa. It is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Vāyu.Vāyuis gas, is it not?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes. Air.,Prabhupāda,"And finer than thevāyuis the ether, the sky. Finer than the sky is the mind. Finer than the mind is the intelligence, and finer than the intelligence is the soul. So they do not know this. They capture only middle thing,vāyu.Wherefrom thevāyucame? Wherefrom the gas came?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That part remains unanswered. That part cannot be answered.,Prabhupāda,"But we answer, we answer. We have got the knowledge. The gas came from ether, and ether came from mind, and mind came from intelligence, and intelligence came from the soul."
Hṛdayānanda,They will say you cannot prove that.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, we can prove that."
Hṛdayānanda,How will you prove it?,Prabhupāda,"You see still, gases, I mean to say, cloud is forming in the sky. But you have no eyes to see it."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:With this background before, then that is why they start saying that before Darwin's theory there should be one. That is called chemical evolution. That is called pre-biotic-chemistry. Means before biological evolution started there should be chemical evolution.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that chemical evolution is part of life demonstration. That I have already explained. Just like the chemical, citric acid, coming from lemon tree, a life. It is coming. So all chemicals are being produced... Just like in your body, in my body, there are so many chemicals. Because the body is there, the chemicals are coming. In my urine you will find so much, so many chemicals. In my stool you will find so many chemicals. Wherefrom the chemicals coming? Daily, enzymes, so many other chemicals are coming. Simply the medical man analyzes the urine, and so many chemicals are there. Wherefrom it came? Because I am living entity, the chemicals are coming in my urine, in my stool, in my cough, in my secretion. It is coming. Therefore it is concluded that chemicals are produced by life, not life is produced by chemicals."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But they are saying that once the seed of life, that is, the cells, the living cells, are built, then it continues automatically.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, but who gives the seed? That is answered inBhagavad-gītā. Bījo 'haṁsarva-bhūtānām[Bg7.10]. Bījo 'haṁsarva-bhūtānām.He gives the seeds, and He is life."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But the scientists are now trying to make the seed.,Prabhupāda,"Then kick on their face with boot. With boot, rascal. You are trying. That is rascaldom. We protest against this. ""We are trying."" What is this nonsense, trying? Do it immediately. Then we shall accept. Trying, everyone is trying. Just like a child is trying to build a house with this sand. So is that very nice proposal, that here will be house? That is childish. Then you accept that you are child in the field of knowledge. Don'tposeyourself that you know everything, or your knowledge is everything. That is our protest. ""We are trying."" Trying, everyone is trying. What is the difference between the scientists and ordinary man?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They are saying that they are coming very close.,Prabhupāda,"Oh! That is also another foolishness. That is called will o' the wisp. The ass. Ass is trying to get the grass, and the washerman is showing only, and the ass is advancing, the grass is advancing. (laughter) You see. This is their thing."
Dr. Wolfe:,"Dr. Wolfe:But in all humility, Śrīla Prabhupāda, supposing that they would succeed in actually creating the living cell artificially, what would we say?",Prabhupāda,What is the credit there? It is already there. So what credit he can get?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Best they just imitated what has already happened.,Prabhupāda,"Imitated. Just like, that I explained also. The example is that when an imitation barking is there, people go and purchase ticket. And when real barking is there, nobody cares. This is their business. They are so fool that their government is purchasing the ticket, and they're hearing the imitation barking. That's all."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But once they are successful they are going to make super beings they are called super beings, superhuman beings, super animals.",Prabhupāda,"But they cannot create even an ant, and now they are going to make super beings. This is another foolishness. They cannot create even an ant, moving ant, and they're going to make super being. Just see. And we have to believe them. (laughter) We are not so fools. Your so-called scientists may be fools, but we are not so fools."
Yaśomatīnandana:,Yaśomatīnandana:You give the example of a potter who was dreaming...,Prabhupāda,"Ah, yes, yes, That's it. A potter."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:This idea Śrīla Prabhupāda, about the chemical evolution, this idea came from, I think, in 1920 by a Russian scientist. He is a biologist. His name is Oparin. So he demonstrated that before biological evolution the atmosphere of the earth should be, he called, very much reducing. Reducing, that means it must be mostly full of hydrogens, no oxygen, very little oxygen, but mostly hydrogen. Then in due course because of the reaction in these hydrogen compounds and the radiation from the sunlight, then these compounds form into different chemicals which are...",Prabhupāda,"That is a side study. But there was hydrogen. Wherefrom the hydrogen came? The scientists, simply they study in the middle. But they do not know what is the origin. Just like here is one aeroplane is coming, and you can say, ""All of a sudden a light came out of the sea."" Is that the study of this aeroplane? If we... the foolish person will see, ""All of a sudden, in the sea there was a light."" Is that scientific study? So your study is like that. ""There was this, and all of a sudden, by chance..."" That's it. That is not scientific study. We have to find out the original cause."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So in due course if they create these amino acids, there are 20 amino acids which are necessary for the body, for the material body.",Prabhupāda,But it is already created. What is your credit?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But they want to do it themselves.,Prabhupāda,"You may do, but already... Just like there is a soap factory. You start another soap factory. So what is your credit? It is already there."
Yaśomatīnandana:,"Yaśomatīnandana:The big, big soap factory.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. What is your credit? Yes. You can imitation, make an imitation. And you want to take credit, all credit, for the original creator, simply by imitating. You are so foolish. Why shall I give you the credit? I shall give credit to the origin. That is our philosophy."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:When they discover a natural law, they name it after themselves, like ""Newton's law."" (laughter)",Prabhupāda,"It is already there, already there, and the rascal wants to take credit."
Yaśomatīnandana:,Yaśomatīnandana:They adjust a little bit and they say that they have conquered...,Prabhupāda,No adjustment. That is another foolishness. You cannot adjust. Even you cannot adjust a moment of nature's law. You cannot adjust.
Yaśomatīnandana:,Yaśomatīnandana:You just discover it.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. No discovery. You do not know, arrangement. This is already there."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Practically they are fighting against the laws of nature, but sometimes they find pleasure in doing this.",Prabhupāda,"That is childish. Just like they build with the sand palatial building, the children, and they take pleasure in it. That's all. That is children's pleasure. That is not sane man's pleasure.Māyā-sukhāyabharamudvahatovimūḍhān[SB7.9.43].Māyā-sukhāya.This pleasure ismāyā,and they are making humbug. Therefore they arevimūḍhān,vimūḍhān,all foolish men.PrahlādaMahārājasaid,māyā-sukhāyabharamudvahatovimūḍhān[SB7.9.43].The materialists, they have created a standard of happiness. That ismāyā.That is not happiness. But for thatmāyāhappiness, false happiness, they have beget a gorgeous arrangement. That's all. Therefore they arevimūḍhān.They are sovimūḍhān,so foolish. Now suppose they have created this nice comfortable civilization, but they have not created the situation that they will be able to enjoy it. At any moment they will be kicked out, ""Get out! Finished. All finished."" So where is that guarantee that you will be able to enjoy this?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is why the scientists are saying that God didn't give us everything so that we can make very happy.,Prabhupāda,"Then God is there. Accept. Then why do you say there is no God? Then God is life. Then everything comes from life. You have to accept. That is our proposal. If they accept that ""God has not given us the capacity,"" then they are intelligent. They are accepting God."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Well, they say, ""God hasn't given us everything because we are not able to live forever here.""",Prabhupāda,Why? That means God is controller. You are controlled. You admit this.
Yaśomatīnandana:,"Yaśomatīnandana:If these people are allowed to live forever then they will make this place more than a hell, worse than hell.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. (laughs) God has given them everything actually, to live peacefully and try to understand God, but that they will not do. They will do something to try to forget God. That is their aim."
Yaśomatīnandana:,"Yaśomatīnandana:Prabhupāda, is it true that if a person is very sinful, he reduces some years from his life? If a person is very, very sinful, extremely sinful, then he reduces some...",Prabhupāda,"Reduce or increase, what is the profit?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:We see the practical example. If you are alcoholic...,Prabhupāda,"Even if you reduce or increase, suppose you are to live for hundred years, if you make it hundred and ten, so what is your profit? And if you are to live for hundred years, reduce time ten years, so what is the profit? You cannot live here, that is a fact, reduce or increase. This is all nonsense. What is increase? The trees, they have more longer period, increased the period, of life. Is, that kind of living is very profitable? What for increasing? To suffering? Your life is already suffering. Why you are covering this body? You cannot stand here, open body. That is suffering. You are trying to save yourself from the suffering. This is life, struggle for existence.Manaḥṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇiprakṛti-sthānikarṣati[Bg.15.7].Simply struggle. So if you increase your life for struggling again, then what is the profit? This is... The rascals, they do not understand. Even if you increase, what profit you will get? Your life is all suffering. So the foolish persons, they cannot understand. The real problem is how to stop your suffering, reduce or increase, it doesn't matter. But that you cannot do. You'll have to die. This is your suffering. Nobody wants to die. You have to become old man. Suppose an old man, suffering from so many diseases, and he increases his life. What is the profit there?"
Yaśomatīnandana:,Yaśomatīnandana:That is what they do by heart transplant.,Prabhupāda,"This is all nonsense. Stop death; then it is an achievement. That's all. Stop disease, that is achievement. But that you cannot do. What is the profit reducing, and increasing or decreasing?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"Yes. I am saying therefore, disease, not ""This disease"" or ""That disease."" Disease mean any kind of disease. That is credit. That is credit. If you guarantee that ""Here is a chemical composition; when a man takes it, no more disease,"" that is credit. But you cannot do that. Then where is your credit? You simply struggle. The struggle we increase. That's all.Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam[Bg.13.9].We shall come down? The water is coming or...?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:The waves are very big.,Prabhupāda,"Now, such a huge quantity of coloring, wherefrom coming, red color? And it will disappear after few minutes. Have you got any control over it, scientist?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Now there is a big scarcity of dye, coloring dye.",Prabhupāda,"Ah, take from here red color. Yes, they can increase the scarcity. That's all. That is in their power."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But they will try to make more, reduce the scarcity.",Prabhupāda,"Where is more? Now, because the petrol stock is decreasing, they are disturbed, increase it, increase it."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So they are trying to make synthetic...,Prabhupāda,"Again ""trying,"" the same disease, ""trying."" (laughter) Same disease. Again ""trying."" That is called... That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā,manaḥṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇiprakṛti-sthānikarṣati[Bg.15.7].They are simply struggle, struggling with the mind. That is their business.Prakṛti-sthānikarṣati.Because he is in thisprakṛti,under the control of the material nature,prakṛti-sthāni—simply a struggle. And mental concoction: ""Now we shall do it. Now we are trying. In future it will be done.""Manaḥ.This is mind, mental concoction.Prakṛtiis doing their own duty, by nature's law. Now, by nature's law, the winter season is coming. Stop it. Stop it. Make it summer season. What you can do? Why so many cloths are required? Turn it into summer. You cannot do anything.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇi...[Bg.3.27]. Theprakṛtiis going on, doing its own duty. You cannot check. Now the sun is rising. Now make it dark. Or in the darkness, ask the sun, ""Get up."" Where is your power? And still you are thinking, that ""We are scientists. We are advancing."" All foolishness. Just surrender toKṛṣṇa.Sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇam[Bg.18.66].What you can do? You cannot even know how many stars and planets are there. Still unknown."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, they say in our universe there are about ten to the eleventh stars. They can count approximately. They say there are about 100 billion stars.",Prabhupāda,"Count the sand grains, count the sand grains."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They would make a rough estimate.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. Even if you make a fool estimate, then still, you are nothing in the face of the creator. Even if you can count."
Yaśomatīnandana:,"Yaśomatīnandana:They are so stupid Prabhupāda that they do not recognize that the most important things in life is birth, death, old age and disease. And if they really want to conquer the nature, they should try to conquer birth, death, old age and disease.",Prabhupāda,"That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14]."
Yaśomatīnandana:,"Yaśomatīnandana:Duratyayā,very hard to overcome.",Prabhupāda,It is not possible.
Yaśomatīnandana:,"Yaśomatīnandana:Even for them there is some medicine in theVedas.If they go to heavenly planets they will be able to live longer. They are so stupid,śūdraclass, that they can't.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Yaśomatīnandana:,"Yaśomatīnandana:Even if they go to heavenly planets by followingVedas,still they will be able to live longer, but by their mundane efforts they will not be able to increase...",Prabhupāda,"No, nobody... In the material world there is no question of living forever. That is not possible. That is in the spiritual world."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Śrīla Prabhupāda, when the scientists explain why there are so many varieties of living entities, they have an explanation.",Prabhupāda,What is that?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They say, ""At the time of evolution, the cells, the genes, sometimes..."" Normally the gene is perfectly copied for the next generation, but sometimes there is a mistake in copying. Just like in the printing press sometimes we do some mistakes. Just like that, there are some mistakes along the path of evolution. So those mistakes, sometimes they just, according to the circumstances, they can stand, and they form a different living entity because of the difference of the genes.",Prabhupāda,"But the mistake is continuing forever, because you'll find the varieties of living entities ever-existing. Therefore the mistake is permanent. So when it is permanent, it is not mistake. It is intelligence."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They'll say if there is no mistake, there will be only one living entity in the whole universe.",Prabhupāda,"Why? Because you have got different mind, therefore you create different situation. Just like we are walking here. Not that everyone is coming to join us. Because they have got different mentality. They want to sleep. We want to rise early in the morning. Why this difference?"
Śrutaśrava:,Śrutaśrava:It is a great mistake they're making.,Prabhupāda,"It is not mistake. It is your desire. And exactly according to the desire, you get a body. It is not mistake. No.Yaṁyaṁvāpismaranbhāvaṁtyajatyantekalevaram[Bg.8.6].At the time of death, whatever you think, exactly nature will give you a similar body. That's all. That is not in your hand. That is in the nature's hand.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ[Bg.3.27]."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But scientifically it can be proved that there is a mistake.,Prabhupāda,"Then that is your mistake. In the laws of nature there is no mistake. There is no mistake. Your mistake. Just like in the railway carriage there is first-class, second-class, third-class. So you have purchased third-class ticket. By mistake, you can go to the first-class and just give him, but you will not be allowed to stay there. So it is your mistake. But these first-class, second-class, third..., that is not a mistake. That is arrangement. Similarly, these varieties... God is so clever that He knows that so many mistakes can be done, and so many varieties are there. As you commit mistake, you enter... ""You come here. It is ready."" And it is very exact mathematically calculated. Because the nature is working in three modes, so you mix up these three modes, it becomes three into three equal nine, and again you multiply nine into nine, equal to eighty-one. Again eighty-one into eighty-one. So many varieties come. Therefore generally it is taken, 84 million varieties. 8, 400,000. That is already there. Just like government creates a prison house. Although the city is not constructed, but they construct a prison house. Why? The government knows that ""There are so many rascals. They will be criminals, they must come here."" So it is not government mistakes. Your mistake. You become criminal and come here. It is your mistake. Why should you be criminal? That is your mistake."
Yaśomatīnandana:,"Yaśomatīnandana:And also, if nature made a mistake, then how could nature supply the necessities of all the living entities? After all...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, there is no mistake.Mayādhyakṣeṇa[Bg.9.10].It is said,mayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsūyatesa-carācaram.Under the supervision ofKṛṣṇa, God, nature is working. How there can be mistake? In theBrahma-saṁhitāit is said,sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktirekāchāyevayasyabhuvanānivibhartidurgā[Bs.5.44].This nature is working just like shadow. Real direction is from God.Icchānurūpamapiyasyacaceṣṭatesā.By His will, nature is working. So how He can be mistaken? Nature is working under the will of God; so how there can be mistake in the part of God? There is no mistake."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They use these terms to explain their proposed theory. This terminology.,Prabhupāda,Which terminology?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Like ""mistake"" and all these things.",Prabhupāda,"Mistake, There cannot be... That is the difference between God and ourself. We are living entity, God is also living entity. But He has no four defects. We have got four defects. We commit mistake, we are illusioned, our senses are imperfect, and we cheat. God does not do all these things. That is the difference between God and ourselves. He does not commit mistake. He is not illusioned. He does not cheat, and His senses are perfect.Vedāhaṁ samatītāni[Bg.7.26]."
Dr. Wolfe:,"Dr. Wolfe:Śrīla Prabhupāda, in technological enlargement or prolongation of our senses, we are also defective, of course.",Prabhupāda,Because we are defective. This material existence means defective existence. This defection not there.
Dr. Wolfe:,"Dr. Wolfe:All the microscopes, and electric things, all these things, they are also defective.",Prabhupāda,"Because it is made by the imperfect senses. So it must be defective. If you construct something with your defective knowledge, then it must be defective."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Even if they make a perfect microscope they still have to look at it through their defective eyes. (laughter),Prabhupāda,"Yes. That's it. This is going on. Therefore whatever they are saying, they are all defective. Yes. That is our conclusion."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So it is just like playing with fire.,Prabhupāda,Mūḍhamūḍhamūḍhamūḍha.Defective meansmūḍha.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But they seem to be quite satisfied.,Prabhupāda,"That, ass is also satisfied. By unnecessarily carrying the load of the washerman, he is satisfied. Everyone is satisfied. Even the worms of the stool, he is satisfied. (laughs) That is nature's law. He is satisfied. So this satisfaction"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:The saying is ""Even the pauper is proud of his penny.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. He is also... You see... InVṛndāvanaI showed you? The dogs were starving, but as soon as he gets another female dog, oh, he is satisfied. To have sex. Oh. You see. So is that satisfaction? He is starving. The belly has gone down, and still, he is satisfied with sex. You see."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That's called illusion.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, this is illusion. Actually, he is not satisfied."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:You once gave the example, Prabhupāda of the drunkards in New York.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:If they just get a bottle of wine they are satisfied even though they are freezing and starving and have no place to stay.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, they are satisfied. Real satisfaction will prevail when one knows God. That is real satisfaction.Bhoktāraṁyaj&#241a-tapasāṁsarva-loka-maheśvaram[Bg.5.29].A devotee will see how by God's design the sea is working, how the sky is staying, how the sun is rising. He is satisfied, ""Oh, how my Lord is great, how He has arranged."" That is satisfaction"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:But Śrīla Prabhupāda, the living entities, thejīvātmāwithin the..., and theParamātmāwithin, why the living entities suffering even theParamātmāis directing the living entity within?",Prabhupāda,"That is not very difficult. Government is always with you, but why you are suffering, and why one is enjoying? Government is not partial. You have created your situation to suffer. That's all. ThereforeKṛṣṇasays that ""You surrender to Me. I will give you all protection."" But you will not do. You must suffer. Suffering is there. As soon as you are disobedient to God, immediately suffering begins. That ismāyā.ThereforeKṛṣṇasays, ""Now you give up all this nonsense business. Surrender to Me. I will give you all protection."" That you will not do. Then you must suffer. That is the song:"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So at some stage during the lifetime, especially in the human form of life...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:...one should come to the senses...,Prabhupāda,That is required.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:...that they are suffering.,Prabhupāda,"Not to speak likemadman. That you are scientists, you are, ""We shall solve all the questions."" This nonsense thing should stop. They should come to God and understand what God says. Then their life is successful. God Himself is speaking in theBhagavad-gītā.Just try to understand. This is not meant for the dogs and cats; this is meant for persons likeArjuna. BecauseBhagavad-gītāwas taught toArjuna—for enlightened, ah, topmost class of men. They'll understand.Imaṁrājarṣayoviduḥ.Evaṁparamparāprāptam[Bg.4.2].So be yourself amongst the topmost intelligent class of men and try to understandBhagavad-gītā.Then you'll be happy."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Prabhupāda, we should go this way.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. But if you want to remain unhappy by your whims, then what... God cannot help you. But you have got the intelli..., independence."
Hṛdayānanda,"So Prabhupāda, if some people say, ""Well, I have no free will,"" that means that they are actually lazy.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. You have got free will, but must utilize it properly. That is free will. Free will means to utilize it properly. That is free will."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So people... SometimesKṛṣṇainterferes in the free will?,Prabhupāda,Ah?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Our free will.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:God interferes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is Kṛṣṇa's special favor. Because by your free will you are going to hell. IfKṛṣṇainterferes, that is Kṛṣṇa's special favor. Just like a child is going to touch fire by free will, and father, ""Eh, don't do it."" That is his special favor."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But it's called causeless mercy.,Prabhupāda,"Ah? Causeless mercy. His mercy is already there, but we are denying the mercy. That is the defect of material existence."
Yaśomatīnandana:,Yaśomatīnandana:Spiritual master is the mercy of God?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. God is distributing His mercy from within and from without. Without mercy is the spiritual master. Without means externally, just in front of you."
Devotee:,Devotee:Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpā...,Prabhupāda,Ahhh!
Devotee:,Devotee:...bhakta-gaṇe.,Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. [break] Impersonalist boys... [break] ...who are... [break] Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:What is life cannot be proved by experiments. So it is not necessary to talk about life now.,Prabhupāda,"(laughs) Grapes are sour. (devotees laugh) The jackal's philosophy. The jackal came in the orchard of grapes and tried to take some grapes. He jumped many times, and when he failed, ""Oh, there is no necessity, it is sour."" It is jackal's philosophy. Sly fox."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They say that ultimately there may be no difference...,Prabhupāda,"It isMāyāvāda,Māyāvāda.Māyāvādasaysbrahmasatyaṁjaganmithyā.This world is false. [break] ...so what... [break] ...prepared it, so he is the cause of this construction of the bench. How can you say there is no cause?"
Hṛdayānanda,Then they would say...,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,"They would say, ""If everything has a cause...""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,"""...then God also must have a cause.""",Prabhupāda,"No, that is God, which has no cause. That is our definition. Everything has cause, but when it comes to a point where there is no more cause, He is cause and effect Himself, then that is God."

But he has no eyes to see either the aroma or the air.
