Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"But generally, unless they are very highly elevated... [break] ...to elevate them,harijanas."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Harijanas.,Prabhupāda,But he did not know how to make themharijana.He was politically trying. These are old garments?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):No. New.,Prabhupāda,They are selling new.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Yes. This is a very well attended market, this area.",Prabhupāda,Yes. I can see. When the market opens?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):About 9 o'clock or 9:30. Then they open until 1(2):30 and close all afternoon. All over Jakarta they close all afternoon and at five o'clock then they open...,Prabhupāda,And go then up to 10:00.
Devotee (1): :,Devotee (1): :Some type of military school. Looks like naval.,Prabhupāda,this road is very nice. (indistinct) What is meaning oftoko?
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):If they say bookstore, they saytoko booko.",Prabhupāda,Toko simara? Toko simara?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Maybe that's one particular store. Usually they say what type of store.Toko sapatermeans shoe store.,Prabhupāda,Sapato?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Sapatu.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.Sapato.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Toko bungameans flower store. They usually have the category. (pause),Prabhupāda,These are wholesale merchants?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):It appears to be. Yes.,Prabhupāda,It is just like Indian market.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Oh.,Prabhupāda,"In India also... Similarly, I've seen Philippines also like this. Japanese almost like this."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Yes. I was there also.,Prabhupāda,Tokyo.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):In Malaysia also (indistinct).,Prabhupāda,"These are all oriental countries. Five thousand years ago this whole planet was India,Bhārata-varṣa. That we get from history,Mahābhārata.This planet name isBhārata-varṣa."
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):After KingParīkṣit, then it divided up, that soon after?",Prabhupāda,"Divided? They are also already divided. But the culture diminished. Because the center of culture was India, Delhi. So as the power diminished, the maintenance of the culture diminished, and by contact with other types of aboriginal, they learned eating meat and gradually degraded. And they discovered different kinds of religion because... Just like at the present moment Christians are protesting why there should not be abortion. So they wanted to degraded. So the Indian culture did not allow, so the separate type of religion came out. This is the (indistinct). They wanted, ""Why there should not be meat-eating?"" But Indian culture would not allow, so they become Mohammedans, they become Christians, like this. Even in India all the..., what are these Mohammedans? The Mohammedans, they are lower class men, less thanśūdra.But Hindus, higher class, they would not touch it. But when the Mohammedans, that we will be on equal right, they, there is a (indistinct)."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):So there's no spiritual motive.,Prabhupāda,"Later on it became political, because as soon as the spiritual power, culture become diminished, the whole thing became material. So people wanted material advantage, so separated from Vedic culture. Just like Buddhists. Buddhism was aHinduculture. But LordBuddhawanted to stop animal sacrifice. In theVedas,animal sacrifice is recommended under certain conditions. He even denied that, ""No that also cannot be done."" So therefore they are separate from Vedic culture. After all these, all these religious systems-Mohammedanism, Jewism, then Christianism, Buddhism—they are at a stage not more than 2,000 years. And before 2,000 years, what was the culture?"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):The Christians here, get money from America. InBali, where there's many Hindus live, they convert many people by saying, ""If you become a Christian, you'll have good economy with us.""",Prabhupāda,And that is the Christian propaganda.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Same in Madras.,Prabhupāda,"In India, everywhere. They cannot attract people by their philosophy. It is show money, ""Yes, come on, take money."" (pause) Hong Kong also. [break] Very, many meat shops. Rather this vegetable,..."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):It's expensive.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Tomorrow morning we have asked some Indian community leaders to come about 7 o'clock, because they want to be requested by you to do something to help make a temple or what you like. But they... Apparently they feel unhappy because we have not met with the leaders and asked them to help.",Prabhupāda,Why should I put the question? They should first of all. They should come forward.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Well, actually that meeting with the Indians they wanted you to eat someprasādamin the room, and come inside, and request, and ask you like that.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. I cannot do that."
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):They told me they wanted you to go in the room forprasādam.But they wanted a meeting and they didn't tell me. I didn't know.,Prabhupāda,"I can request them. But if they deny that will be insult for me. Therefore I do not like to request them. That will be not good for them, if I request and then they deny, or they do not do. That is not that will be good for them. It is better not to request. That will be offense, if they deny. Or if they did not carry out my order, then it will be offense. Why should they put themselves in such risk? Generally it is the duty of the householder to offer, ""Sir, what can I do for you?"" Then I can request. But if, as a beggar, I request them and they deny, then that will be great offense for them. That will not good for them."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):We are almost there.,Prabhupāda,So you wanted to secure place here?
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Yes. They have a house in this area, but it is a bit far from the center of town.",Prabhupāda,"Never mind. It is good quarter, you can take it."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):O.K. It is about onemilemore though.,Prabhupāda,That doesn't matter.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):O.K.,Prabhupāda,This is also a center. It is congested.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Yes. It is near a bus station also.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. (end) Śyāmasundara:Have money to expand. Everything is going nice. It is organized. Yes. Management means everything is in order, otherwise what is the illusion of (indistinct). Śyāmasundara:If there's no manager, then asannyāsīshould step forward. Pa&#241cadraviḍa:Sometimes though it's hard to maintain this routine. You yourself told the devotees not to go out and purchase excessive amounts of sweets but that didn't check them. They're still in the sweet shops continually. This morning I woke a,... Huh? Pa&#241cadravi&#7693;a:</B> I went to wake a devotee up, I woke him up at a quarter to four. I said ""Prabhu, you want to get up now, it's four o'clock, time to wake."" So he didn't wake but I, I went ahead and bathed because I wanted to do that, and then I come back and it was almost time for <I><a href=""/d/arati"" class=""d"">&#257;rati</a>.</I> So I said, ""If you are not going to bathe at least get out of bed and come to <I>&#257;ratik.</I> But he wouldn't even do that much. So what can you do under these conditions when you tell somebody, you can't physically twist their arm.</div>
<A NAME=""353228""></A><div id=""353228""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><B>&#346;y&#257;masundara:</B> But the whole idea is that if you create a spiritual atmosphere that's so enlivening that everyone will want to participate in it, that's the solution. You can't individually treat each person. You have to get the whole thing generated by, by pouring water on the root.</div>
<A NAME=""353229""></A><div id=""353229""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> That if you sit down for chanting, they should automatically sit down. If one is left, then you can maybe say, ""Why you did not come?"" But if there is no chanting, no sitting, simply wake up, wake up, wake up, all right, I'm waking up (indistinct). But one may wake up or not, you begin your work immediately.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><B>&#346;y&#257;masundara:</B> The whole thing is that we're sort of at a crisis in India, in terms of our presence here. Our prestige has hit an all-time low simply because of our conduct, that's all. Not because of our teaching, or because we are white, or anything like that. It's just because of our conduct. It's been so bad. Abominable. We don't in any way compare with the Indian <I>sanny&#257;s&#299;s</I> in our conduct. So how can we expect to honor &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da if we conduct ourselves like that? So it's part of our responsibilities as the leaders not to avoid it, not to avoid the other devotees, but to train them now, begin training them.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> Yes, this is the <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> training. Now we should have our routine work. Just like here, punctually, as soon as I see seven, I ask, ""When is he coming?"" (indistinct). As soon as (indistinct), immediately I ask. So there may be more (indistinct), but the routine work must be followed. If somebody is slipping, the <I><a href=""/d/kirtana"" class=""d"">k&#299;rtana</a></I> is going on (indistinct) morning, (indistinct) is going on.

But if he is completely incorrigible, then he will be asked to leave.

<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> By engaging. That is our school. It is a school. If a student does not learn nicely, you cannot say, ""Get out."" As far as possible. But when it is absolutely impossible to correct him, then you have to ask. And if there is money, equal you have to manage some money, what can be done? But I don't think if we try our best to correct him, this ultimate punishment will be required. Human being, after all human being, and our business is to teach and become ideal ourself. <I>&#256;pani <a href=""/d/acari"" class=""d"">&#257;cari</a> <a href=""/d/prabhu"" class=""d"">prabhu</a> <a href=""/d/jivere"" class=""d"">j&#299;vere</a> <a href=""/d/sikhaya"" class=""d"">&#347;ikh&#257;ya</a>.</I> We have to teach by our personal behavior.

If one is not cleansing, you shall tell me (indistinct) this way. We have to do like that. Not that I (order), ""Come on, you do this. Oh, you cannot do, get out."" Not that. We show him. After all, our life is sacrificed for preaching and that preaching means one should behave himself, nicely. He cannot say that ""You do not do this."" Just like one day in London there was some talks with <a href=""/d/nanda"" class=""d"">Nanda</a> <a href=""/d/kumara"" class=""d"">Kum&#257;ra</a>, you. He was accusing you, you were accusing him. I heard from (indistinct). So you should do in such a way that he cannot accuse you. If you ask him to rise early in the morning, take your bath, and if you do not take. Supposing some special case. I was taking early bath. Now I do not take, because due to my health. That is because... Otherwise regularly I was taking. Not even hot water. Regularly. This hot water bath I have begun in your country, otherwise I have never taken. Even in severest cold. Here also I am trying to avoid. I am keeping tub of water sunshine. Whatever little warm may become, that's all.

<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Pa&#241cadravi&#7693;a:</B> In your lectures you emphasized two aspects must be there, <I><a href=""/d/jnana"" class=""d"">j&#241&#257;na</a></I> and renunciation. So some knowledge is there, but that part of the difficulty is that with most of the devotees in every temple in India, is that they have not renounced these dirty things completely. They still are attached to sense gratification even on gross levels. So whether a <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></I> or anybody interferes with their sense gratification, they tend to not oblige because they are attached to doing things the way they want. And they think because they are in a foreign country here, a long way from America where the standards are very rigid, that they can do any manner of nonsense and nobody will check them. And if you try to correct them, then they will only do it behind your back. We have seen this, with the sweet shops, with rising early, anything that interferes with them doing as, exactly as they please, they don't want to oblige. And this is in Calcutta, this is in Bombay, and it's happening here in <a href=""/d/vrndavana"" class=""d"">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>. It's not something that's isolated here to the palace, but the devotees all over, they are just behaving on the level of sense gratification, end that's why there is so much <I>rajas <a href=""/d/guna"" class=""d"">gu&#7751;a</a></I> in the temples.

Because we don't want to sit down and talk nonsense or do nonsense, and if you try to stop them they will not stop. So why we should fall down to that level? So we behave as separatist. We go into our room and we'll read, or we'll go into our room and chant, or we'll try and keep ourself clean, or try and do these things, and that is separatism because it's not falling into the level of <I><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a></I> that's going on everywhere else in the temple, engaging in party politics and all these other things.

Otherwise, it will be not very nice to attract when people are attracted by seeing your behavior. They are seeing that, ""Oh, Europeans and Americans, they have got such nice Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas."" They are attracted on that point. But if we are not to the standard point, they will immediately accuse, ""Oh, they are..."" So that should be corrected.

<A NAME=""353399""></A><div id=""353399""> </div>
<div class=""Conversation""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. He was my intimate friend. So in their house, old <a href=""/d/tirtha"" class=""d"">T&#299;rtha</a> <a href=""/d/maharaja"" class=""d"">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> went to beg some alms&mdash;they are very rich man. So, he informed me that ""One nice <I><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></I> came to our house,'' and he was invited, ""in Ultadanga there is <a href=""/d/gaudiya"" class=""d"">Gau&#7693;&#299;ya</a> <a href=""/d/matha"" class=""d"">Ma&#7789;ha</a>, so he has invited me. I wish to go there. Why don't you come? Let us go together."" He was my very intimate friend. So at that time I was a little pessimistic (?), ""I know all these <I>s&#257;dhus</I> there, I am not going.'' So he forced me, ""Oh, why not come? Let us go.'' ""All right, let us go."" So I went to see His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta <a href=""/d/sarasvati"" class=""d"">Sarasvat&#299;</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura in 1922 in that Ultadanga building, and that time Prabhup&#257;da was sitting on the roof. There was small house (indistinct) room, and we were welcome, because they thought Naren Mullik was very rich man and he has contributed some money. So, we went to see Prabhup&#257;da, offered our obeisances. So immediately he said that ""You are all educated young men, why don't you preach Lord <a href=""/d/caitanya"" class=""d"">Caitanya</a> Mah&#257;prabhu's message throughout the whole world?'' So I replied him, ""Sir, we are dependent nation, who will hear our message? We can talk all these things after we get independence,'' because I was politically-minded at that time. So he refuted my argument. Certainly I was defeated, and I took his words very seriously, I appreciated. Then we were offered some <I><a href=""/d/prasadam"" class=""d"">pras&#257;dam</a></I>, we came down, and my friend Naren Mullik asked me, ""How did you like this <I><a href=""/d/sadhu"" class=""d"">s&#257;dhu</a>?</I>'' ""Yes, here is a <I><a href=""/d/sadhu"" class=""d"">s&#257;dhu</a></I> in whose hands <a href=""/d/caitanya"" class=""d"">Caitanya</a> Mah&#257;prabhu's message is there, and it will be done. I think this is very nice.'' That was my appreciation. Then 1923, I resigned my post as manager in Bose's laboratory, and I accepted the agency of whole U.P., beginning from Mughalsarai (?) up to Delhi, and I made my head office in Allahabad.

They thought, these Ramakrishna Mission rascals have come. (laughter) So he was not very happy, but I told, he was sitting. He, so the meeting he just criticized. Then when he heard the speech of our old <a href=""/d/tirtha"" class=""d"">T&#299;rtha</a> <a href=""/d/maharaja"" class=""d"">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, our old Godbrother, he understood, ""Oh, they are Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas.''
