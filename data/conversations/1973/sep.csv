Guest:,"Guest:Yet no two are the same, are they?",Prabhupāda,Eh.
Guest:,Guest:They are not the same.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Varieties. Everything is variety. Everything is variety, full of varieties. We find the same species ofrose. Still, you'll find varieties. In human, twin brothers you will find still varieties."
Guest:,"Guest:And inGolokaVṛndāvana, are there still varieties? Are there still varieties inVṛndāvana?",Prabhupāda,Vṛndāvana?
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:GolokaVṛndāvana, are there still varieties he said.",Prabhupāda,"Oh yes. There are varieties.Ānanda,ānanda,pleasure means varieties. Variety is the mother of enjoyment. Without varieties, just like we prepare from grains, sugar, ghee, hundreds of varieties. If you simply give grain, ghee and sugar, it will not be enjoyable. But the same thing, you prepare in varieties and give you a plate, oh, you'll say, ""Oh, so nice thing."" The ingredients are the same. Grains, ghee and sugar, that's all. Similarly, this material world, the ingredients are the same. Namely five gross elements and three subtle elements, finer. Earth, water, air, fire, sky. These are gross elements. And mind, intelligence, ego these are finer elements. Combined together this material world has come. The brain behind is a living entity. Just like we are using these ingredients, these five elements: earth, water, air, fire, sky, making this building, making this table, making this chair,vase, so many things, harmonium, pictures, book. So the ingredients are the same, but my brain is working in different varieties. My brain or your brain. Human brain. Similarly this material cosmic manifestation is full of varieties. The brain behind it isKṛṣṇa. That is stated, you have read ourBhagavad-gītā?"
Guest:,Guest:I've taken a look.,Prabhupāda,There is a verse. Find out: Purport?
Guest:,"Guest:Is modern science materialism, Prabhupāda? Is it materialism?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,"Guest:All, all materialism?",Prabhupāda,"Just dealing with earth, water, air, fire, sky. That's all."
Guest:,"Guest:And in this time, modern science, you know, physics, chemistry, mathematics; is this all materialism?",Prabhupāda,All materialism.
Guest:,Guest:All materialism.,Prabhupāda,They do not know what is spiritual.
Guest:,"Guest:And inside these people doing this work, is itKṛṣṇa? Or what is it makes them do the work?",Prabhupāda,"No. The soul is a living being. So nature is supplying material and he's molding in different forms. Just like earth is not man's creation. Earth is God's creation, or it is product of God's energy. But we are using this earth and molding in different forms, different pots, different dolls. So ingredients are supplied by God. Nature means God's energy. We simply handle them. We cannot produce anything, we transform only. Just like this iron, we cannot produce iron. It is gotten from the mine, iron bar. Now we have transformed into different forms. Because we have got creative energy like God, not very great, in very minute quantity. So as God has created by His intelligence, the whole universe—we are creating this table, this pillow, this harmonium—that's all. What you are finding?"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:I was just looking at that verse again.,Prabhupāda,Which verse?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Mayādhyakṣeṇa...,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Guest:,Guest:Because one man says one thing and one man says another thing. So many people have different things to say.,Prabhupāda,"No, personally. Suppose I ask you. What is your, you want to ask me?"
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:You have, that letter has a return address from Maṇḍalībhadra?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is here. Now the water... Just like from your body, water is produced, is it not?"
Guest:,Guest:Transformed?,Prabhupāda,"Transformed or whatever, but you see urine is coming, perspiration is coming. So these different waters are produced by your energy within the body. So why not from God's energy the vast water?"
Guest:,"Guest:Yes, truly.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,Guest:But why should he give us...,Prabhupāda,"Because God is unlimited, He has got unlimited energy. have got limited energy. I can pass urine, say one pound, I can have perspiration say, one ounce but if God likes He can produce unlimited water. Why this one Atlantic Ocean? Many millions of Atlantic Oceans He can produce. Water produced from His body. So where is the difficulty to understand? WhenKṛṣṇasays that the elements... Other matters are growing. Just like the hair. Now, today, I have shaved. Three days after, again it will grow. So I have got my energy within by which I'm constantly growing. But, hair is a material thing. So anything you take, it grows from the Supreme. It is very easy to understand."
Guest:,"Guest:Hmm. And ah, this inside, it grows because ofKṛṣṇadoes it?",Prabhupāda,"Everything is growing on account ofKṛṣṇa. Your body, inside or outside, it is made of these five elements: earth, water, air, fire, like that. It is nothing but combination of these five elements."
Guest:,Guest:Is the water inside the same as the water in the ocean?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,Guest:It's the same water.,Prabhupāda,Yes. You... Have you tasted ever perspiration?
Guest:,Guest:Hmm?,Prabhupāda,"Perspiration, have you tasted?"
Guest:,"Guest:Tasted it, yes, salt.",Prabhupāda,"Salt, yes."
Guest:,"Guest:Ocean, yes.",Prabhupāda,It has got.
Guest:,Guest:But one ocean is not the same as another eh? My business is mathematics. It's not very transcendental.,Prabhupāda,You are teacher?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:He's asking if his business is transcendental.,Prabhupāda,"No, if it is used forKṛṣṇa, then it is transcendental. If it is used for your sense gratification, then it is material. That is the difference."
Guest:,Guest:Yes. And how do you know whether you're using it forKṛṣṇaor not?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That requires training from the Kṛṣṇa's representative,guru. Just like these boys are being trained up inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So it requires little training. Just like you are mathematician. To make another student mathematician, you have to train him. You have to teach him how to calculate two plus two equal to four. It will never be five. If somebody says, ""No, my calculation is two plus two equal to five."" Will it be accepted?"
Guest:,Guest:I'm afraid sometimes it can be true. (laughs),Prabhupāda,How it can be true?
Guest:,Guest:One plus one can equal three.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Guest:,Guest:One plus one can equal three sometimes.,Prabhupāda,Is there mathematical calculation?
Guest:,"Guest:I know that it's ah... I mean things reproduce. Life is not so fixed, not so rigid. But one does have to be trained, it's true. Training is, some people can understand and some people cannot understand.",Prabhupāda,That is difference of understanding.
Guest:,Guest:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"The fact is true. But if I cannot understand, that is my misfortune."
Guest:,"Guest:Yes. And if I can't understand what this is the end of the... So yes, it's the same. I think this is right.",Prabhupāda,"God is fact. But if somebody cannot understand, it is his misfortune."
Guest:,"Guest:Yes. And another time, another place.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,"Guest:As you say, there are many oceans. The Christians say, ""In my father's house are many mansions."" A Chair. (indistinct) Good enough?",Prabhupāda,"No, you can sit down."
Guest:,"Guest:This has come a long way from the Barrier Reef, the Pacific. These shells. The shells.",Prabhupāda,Oh yes.
Guest:,"Guest:From the Pacific. From the Barrier Reef, Australia. You know the Barrier Reef?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,"Guest:Yes, that's where they come from, the Barrier Reef.",Prabhupāda,I have seen the reef.
Guest:,Guest:You have?,Prabhupāda,In Australia.
Guest:,"Guest:Oh, yes. I would like to see that. The sea is wonderful, isn't it? You like the sea they tell me.",Prabhupāda,"Oh yes. Very green, clear."
Guest:,Guest:Always a different color though. Always a little different isn't it?,Prabhupāda,"Well, reef I have seen. It is about, not less than two hundred feet."
Guest:,"Guest:Really? They say under the water is beautiful, the light, and the color.",Prabhupāda,They go under the water?
Guest:,"Guest:They go, yes, under the water, in skin-diving. The coral, coral? Grows coral doesn't it? They say it's all, very beautiful.Jaya.Well, thank you, Prabhupāda,jaya.",Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. Give himprasāda.Thank you.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Take a little sweet.,Prabhupāda,What is your name?
Guest:,Guest:Peter.,Prabhupāda,"Peter, oh yes."
Guest:,Guest:Thank you very much.,Prabhupāda,Jaya.(end)
Guest (1) (Indian man):,"Guest (1) (Indian man):...Yes, yes. I ask him why, after such a long lapse of time we could see this trait ofHindudharma.",Prabhupāda,Prabhupāda.:Yes. NotHindudharma.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Or Vedicdharma.,Prabhupāda,"...but spiritual, satisfaction of spiritual starvation. Because we are spiritual beings. That I was trying to explain. That we have bodily necessities, at the same time we have spiritual necessities. This Western civilization, they are simply after the bodily necessities. Just like here is a qualified medical man. He's made... What for, medical man? He knows how to satisfy the medical necessities of the body. He has no information of the spirit soul. Is it not a fact? Have you got any idea what is spirit soul?"
Guest (2) (Indian Doctor):,"Guest (2) (Indian Doctor):Not from the medical knowledge, certainly not.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore I say that these universities, educational institution, all over the world, they are simply concerned with this body. According to our Vedic culture, to remain satisfied with the bodily necessities of life is the business of animals.Saevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13]."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):What is God to a layman, like me.",Prabhupāda,"Layman, well, layman means, we already explained, he's no better than animal. Because layman means one who thinks that ""I am this body."" He's layman. He has no other information. So layman is equal to animal. So layman's education, layman's advancement is decoration of the dead body. If you decorate a dead body, you can feel satisfaction. But others will laugh, that ""What a fool he is, he's decorating a dead body?""Bhagavad-bhakti-hīnasyajātiḥśāstraṁjapastapaḥ, aprāṇasyevadehasyamaṇḍanaṁloka-rañjanam.Layman's business is decorating this dead body, that's all."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yeah, but if you were to explain to him what is God, how would you explain to him.",Prabhupāda,"Then, suppose, what you are? What is your business? What do you do? You're teacher, what is the subject matter?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):I teach in law.,Prabhupāda,"So if one wants to know what is law, he must become a student. It is not that simply asking ""What is law, sir?"" You can make him understand within a minute or within hour? Is it possible?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):No.,Prabhupāda,"First of all, you must become graduate, then you should take entrance in the law college, then you must learn. So what is God, that is the inquiry, but it requires training. And that is Vedicdharma,varṇāśrama-dharma.Varṇāśrama-dharma. Varṇāśramācaravatāpuruṣeṇaparaḥpumān[Cc.Madhya8.58].Anyone who has taken to this system ofvarṇāśrama-dharma,fourvarṇas:brāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,śūdra;and fourāśrama:brahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,sannyāsa.Unless one takes to this institutional education, he's no more than an animal. So to know God means he must become abrāhmaṇa,real, qualifiedbrāhmaṇa.Thereforebrāhmaṇais respected. Because,brahma-jānātītibrāhmaṇa.But there is no law. Lawless country. Therefore one is passing as abrāhmaṇawithout any knowledge ofBrahman. That is the defect. Formerly the government will see... I was explaining this, this morning. That it is the kṣatriya's duty to see that one is passing as abrāhmaṇa,whether he's qualified. Why he should pass? Suppose he says, ""I'm medical man."" He must be qualified. And if he says, ""I am medical man,"" then he's cheating. So you cannot call yourself abrāhmaṇaunless you are qualified. But that is going on. And this cheating is being accepted. Therefore thisvarṇāśrama-dharma.Hindudharmaor Vedicdharmameansvarṇāśrama-dharma.One must first of all accept the principles ofvarṇasandāśramas.Then there is question of understanding God. God is not so cheap thing, ""What is God?"" and you understand immediately. You must become first of allbrāhmaṇa."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):So in order to understand what is God one has to leave his family and come to some...,Prabhupāda,Why do you surmise like that? You do not know what is God. Why do you surmise your proposal?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, I mean, ah...",Prabhupāda,"Now why you are asking this question? You know, I've explained, that one has to becomebrāhmaṇa.There are still there are manybrāhmaṇas,those who are with children. EvenCaitanyaMahāprabhu, although He had no children, He was family man.NityānandaPrabhuwas family man, andAdvaitaPrabhuwas family man. They're allbrāhmaṇas,family men, but they knew what is God. The real thing is to know God. Not to, because everything is allowed. These eight, fourvarṇasand fourāśramas.There is no such thing that one has to become, to come to this form of life or that form of life. Sovarṇāśramācaravatā.You must execute thevarṇāśrama-dharma.Then you'll understand. It doesn't matter whether you are abrāhmaṇaorkṣatriyaorvaiśyaorśūdra,that is a cooperation. Just like in your body there must be the head, there must be the arms, there must be the belly, and there must be the legs. By comparative study head is more important than the leg. But leg is also required. You cannot do without leg. Similarly,brāhmaṇais the head,kṣatriyais the arms,vaiśyais the belly andśūdrais the leg. So as much I require my head so much I require the leg also. But the leg must do the leg's duty and the head must do the head's duty. Then it is perfect. And if the head is cracked, then everything is gone, madman. So at the present moment there is nobrāhmaṇa,qualified. Therefore the society is in chaos. In chaotic condition, all are searching after something substantial. That is the position of the Western countries. They have heard so many things about India's culture. Still, they respect India's culture, spiritual culture. They are hankering after. But unfortunately the so-called yogis, swamis, come and cheat them. That is the difficulty. This is the first time that systematically we are presenting what is actual VedicdharmaorBhāgavata-dharma.This question was raised byRāmānandaRāyabeforeCaitanyaMahāprabhu.Varṇāśrama,he quoted this verse fromViṣṇuPurāṇa.CaitanyaMahāprabhusaid,ehobāhya, āgekahaāra.""Yes, it is all right,varṇāśrama-dharma,but it is now external. If you know something better, you speak."" So in this way the whole system was discussed. At lastCaitanyaMahāprabhuapproved this system ofśravaṇaṁkīrtanaṁviṣṇoḥ[SB7.5.23].Chanting and hearing aboutViṣṇu.Varṇāśrama-dharmais alsoViṣṇu.Viṣṇurārādhyate.The real purpose is understandingViṣṇuthe Supreme. Sovarṇāśrama-dharmais also meant for understandingViṣṇu.Viṣṇurārādhyate.So... But these formulas ofbrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,it is the, the age is so rotten that it is very difficult to revive thisvarṇāśrama-dharmaculture. ThereforeCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid,ehobāhya, āgekahaāra.Yes, it is all right, but it is external now. It cannot be utilized at the present moment. So whenRāmānandaRāyastated, citing one verse fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam:sthānesthitāḥśruti-gatāṁtanu-vāṅ-manobhiryeprāyaśo 'jita jito 'pyasitaistri-lokyām.If one simply hears aboutViṣṇu, never mind in whatever condition he is, then he can understand what is God.Sthānesthitāḥśruti-gatām. Śruti-gatāmmeans hearing. Receiving from the ear.Śruti-gatāṁtanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.And in that way if he engages his body, his words,tanu-vāk,mind, then, although LordViṣṇuisAjita, nobody can conquer Him, he can conquer. He can understand what isViṣṇu, what is His function, what is my relationship with Him. All these things can be understood. Therefore we are propagating the same principle. We do not ask anyone: ""First of all, you becomebrāhmaṇa.Then come here."" No. Let him come and hear aboutViṣṇu. We speak, discuss aboutBhagavad-gītā.They hear. They hearŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.You have seen our books? So these books are discussed and gradually... If it is a fact,śruti-gatāṁtanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ,if one gives only aural reception to this transcendental message, then, although God isAjita, nobody can conquer, He becomes conquered. So that is becoming, happening, that although they are American, European, Canadian, African, Australian, not all of them are Indian... Indians are also there. But because they are giving aural reception to this transcendental message, they are becoming enlightened. So anyone who will give aural reception to this message, first of allBhagavad-gītā,entrance, thenBhāgavatam,thenCaitanya-caritāmṛta,like books, then gradually, he'll be self-realized, fully cognizant what is God. What is God, this is...athātobrahmajijñāsāmeans what is God. So this institution is meant for giving chance to everyone to hear. It doesn't require education. Simply God has given him this ear. Let him receive the message from the ear.Śruti-gatāṁtanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.This is the process. Very simple process. Simply to hear, sincerely, then everything will be done gradually.CaitanyaMahāprabhuhas said,ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12].By hearing, the mirror of consciousness, consciousness is just like a mirror. It is now covered with dust.Mārjanam.Mirror, if you cleanse with a duster, then you can see clearly what is your face. So by this chanting process and hearing, gradually the dirty things in the heart will be cleansed.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥpuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ[SB1.2.17].Simply hearing aboutKṛṣṇaispuṇya,pious activities.Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.Either you hear or you chant.Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ. Hṛdyantaḥstho hyabhadrāṇi.There are so many dirty things, nonsense things, within the heart.Hṛdyantaḥstho hyabhadrāṇi,vidhunoti,is washed.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥpuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.Who is...? Find out this verse.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥpuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.In the First Canto, first part, Third Chapter. Where isPaṇḍitaMahārāja? Call him.Śṛṇvatām,you can find out in the index."
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:S-i?,Prabhupāda,Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥ.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:S-i-n?,Prabhupāda,R.Sva-kathāḥ.Yes. What...
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Sva-pathaḥ?,Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇa.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥ.You are not learning, onlyPaṇḍitaGosāñiis required. Where isPaṇḍitaGosāñi?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Can I have a look at it please?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, give him.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥpuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ, hṛdyantaḥstho hyabhadrāṇi[SB1.2.17].(speaks some Bengali. Asks some Indians if they know Bengali, where they are from.)"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:It's not in the Third Chapter.,Prabhupāda,"Let me see. First Canto, where it is?"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:S-i?,Prabhupāda,S-r.
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:S-r,śṛṇ,oh.",Prabhupāda,Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥ.You could not find? Here it is.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:I was looking s-i.,Prabhupāda,"Find out. Second Canto, no?"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:107 Second Chapter.,Prabhupāda,"Second Chapter, Second Chapter, seventeenth verse, yes."
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:,Prabhupāda,Vidhunotisuhṛtsatām.What is the meaning?
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:""ŚrīKṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is theParamātmā, Supersoul, in everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.""",Prabhupāda,"This is the process. If you hear aboutKṛṣṇa, thenKṛṣṇais within yourself.Īśvaraḥsarva-bhūtānāṁhṛd-deśe'rjunatiṣṭhati[Bg.18.61].When he sees you are anxious, then he helps you in cleansing the dirty things within your heart. Purport read? The prescribed methods are there. We have to adopt it. Without adopting the prescribed method, nobody can advance. But in this age the prescribed method is very simple. Simply to hear the holy name of the Lord."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I don't know actually. I'm a doc. I'm trying to find some answer but what difference does it make? Suppose a person thinks of God all his life and dies, and a person who doesn't think of God at all also dies. What is our life after death?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Then why do we have to think of God? Why do we have to forget about the material world?,Prabhupāda,First of all you have to understand that there is life after death.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Why, is it a faith or belief?",Prabhupāda,"No, it is not faith, belief. It is a fact. Just like, I have already given you the example. You were a child. That body's no longer existing, but you know that you were a child. Therefore the conclusion is that although the body has changed, but you the soul, the knower, is still there. Therefore, when this body will be changed, you'll exist in another body."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):In what form?,Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. First of all you have to accept this fact, that you have to change this body. As you have already changed so many times.Tathā...Kṛṣṇafirst of all saystathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Antara,another body you have to accept."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Coming back to your own question of the present world and to what we are in...,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Coming back to your first question when you asked that what do you think about this present world or the present trend of present civilization...?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. They do not know. Even big, big professors. I talked with Professor Kotofsky in Moscow. He said, ""Swamiji, after annihilation of this body, there is nothing."""
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Well, that has brought this disaster and is causing more and more trouble, I think. More and more in practice of medicine, if we look into the practice of medicine, I think, we are more pressed with the problem of mental illness. I should say in the region of thirty percent of our time is devoted for people suffering from mental anxiety, which we call ""anxiety state"" and partly depression. I think most of the time, I surmise... Part of the problem is not that they are not well-fed, it is not that they are not well-dressed. Part of the problem is to accept as they are and to think of something which is present, I mean they could believe that there is something beyond this world, and if they can accept that, probably they will be better off and they will accept their present inconveniences more easily and will not be depressed.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):And that is the present problem.,Prabhupāda,"That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā:mātrā-sparśāstukaunteyaśītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ.Sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ That is, that is next question, that you have to accept next body, but what kind of body you'll have? That you can see, that there are so many varieties of life, body. You have to accept one of them. Just like when you were admitted into school for education. The idea was that you'll be educated, and according to your education, there are so many posts you'll have to occupy. Just like you are lawyer, he's medical man, somebody's engineer, somebody else, somebody... Varieties or field of activities. So according to the perfection of one's education, he has to accept one post like that. Similarly, next body means according to yourkarma.Karmaṇādaiva-netreṇajantur dehopapattaye[SB3.31.1].You are preparing your next Life. That is also explained in theBhagavad-gītā:"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Yes. Can you scientifically prove this, sir? I mean is it purely a matter of belief or...",Prabhupāda,"This is science. Our science is perfect science. Because we are receiving knowledge from the perfect,Kṛṣṇa. And the so-called science is imperfect because the knowledge is received from imperfect person. However great scientist you may be, you have to admit that your senses are imperfect."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So imperfect senses can give imperfect knowledge. That is not scientific knowledge. What you are thinking scientific knowledge, that is bogus. Because the man who has given that knowledge, he's imperfect. How you can expect perfect knowledge from the imperfect person?"
Guest (2):,Guest (2):It's a question of degree.,Prabhupāda,"Now, degree may be, but ultimately, if you are unable to give perfect knowledge, then what is the use of taking knowledge from you?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Yes, I accept that view. But how do you prove that a man...?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, therefore you take from the perfect,Kṛṣṇa. We take from Kṛṣṇa's representative. One who speaks as good asKṛṣṇa. That is our process.Evaṁparamparā-prāptamimaṁrājarṣayoviduḥ[Bg.4.2].We don't take, don't accept knowledge from any rascal. We accept knowledge fromKṛṣṇa, the Supreme. I may be rascal, but because I am receiving knowledge from the perfect, whatever we speak, that is perfect. A child may be innocent he does not know. But he has learned that this article is called spectacle. So when he says, the child says, ""Father, this is spectacle."" This is perfect knowledge. Similarly, if you hear from the perfect and act accordingly, then you are perfect. NowKṛṣṇasays,tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ.After death there is another body. So we accept it. It doesn't require any proof of so-called science who's imperfect."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):So the question of belief comes first.,Prabhupāda,"It is not belief, it is fact."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Yes, but if you say fact, how do you prove?",Prabhupāda,"This is proof,Kṛṣṇasays."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):It has been said byKṛṣṇa. Yes, but...,",Prabhupāda,"That is our Vedic evidence. Whenever we speak something, immediately quote fromVedas.This is our process. If it is accepted by the Vedic process, then it is perfect. Just like in the law court. You are lawyer. You are arguing. When you quote from a judgement, previous judgement, it is accepted. Similarly, when you give authoritative statement support of your talking, then it is perfect. That is the way. Otherwise, what for these books are there? If it is mental speculation what is the use of these books? But as soon as we speak something, we immediately support by quoting from Vedic literature. And that is perfect. And now you have to possess little knowledge. Just likeKṛṣṇasays, howKṛṣṇais perfect.Kṛṣṇais giving example side, by side.Yathā, dehino 'sminyathādehe[Bg.2.13].Asmindehe,as there is the soul, there is the soul,asmindehe,and he's having different types of bodies,kaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā.He's changing body from childhood, boyhood, boyhood to youth-hood, youth-hood to another state.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ.Where is the illogical presentation? This is scientific. For an intelligent man, this is scientific. And if he's still dull-headed, then what can be done?Kṛṣṇagives example.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ.As the soul is changing body, from babyhood to childhood, childhood to boyhood, boyhood to youth-hood, like that. Similarly, after finishing this body, it may be invisible to you, but the subtle body is there. We have got two kinds of bodies.Bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥkhaṁmanobuddhirevaca[Bg.7.4].This material, eight kinds of materials—earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence, ego. So when your body of earth, water, fire, air... Now in the... Now here is a medical man. He knows about this body made of earth, water, fire, air. But he does not know, perhaps, the body made of mind, intelligence and ego. Do you think so? That there is another body made of mind, intelligence and ego?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Not, not in that sense.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. The mind is there. Everyone knows, you have got mind, I have got mind. But can you see the mind? Can you see the intelligence?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):These are something abstract, you know.",Prabhupāda,"No, not abstract. These are material. You have no eyes to see."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, at present, we can, we have got three different methods of studying intelligence starting from six months onward up to the adult.",Prabhupāda,"Anyway, you accept. That is my point. Now you are studying, you accept. That means you accept there is intelligence. So besides this material body, gross material body, there is a subtle body. Subtle body. Just like besides your coat, there is a shirt, or there is aganjee(?). Similarly, the soul is covered by the subtle body and the gross body. What is known as death, that is annihilation of the gross body. The subtle body remains there. And the subtle body carries him as he desires. The subtle body carries him to a place where he can again grow another material body according to the desire of the mind."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):You mean the subtle body or the soul, the same thing?",Prabhupāda,"No, soul is different. Soul is different. Soul is finer than intelligence. These things are explained in theBhagavad-gītā."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Is it in different parts of the body?,Prabhupāda,"These are air.Prāṇa,in theprāṇa,air, the soul floats. Therefore the controlling the air is calledprāṇāyāma.That is yogic process."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Thank you.,Prabhupāda,"Prāṇais a life air which carries the soul. It is very small, atomic. And not our men. Give her. She's answered. (laughs) Give her one."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Thank you.,Prabhupāda,"Give her one, that girl. Give all. (Bengali) You are a lawyer. (Bengali) That is not your business. You must know it."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):(Bengali),Prabhupāda,That's a good qualification.
Guest (3):,Guest (3):No.,Prabhupāda,"Why should you be bad qualified? (Bengali) Logic, it is logical.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Where is the illogic. You have passed your childhood body, you have passed your youth-hood body, you are in a different body. Although you are in a different body, you are existing. What better logic you can discover? You cannot discover any better logic than this. Don't accuse that we are illogical, don't accuse. We are logical, completely logical. But we have got brain to understand. Yes. Logic, you can put forward, but one must have the brain to understand it. If one is dull like stone, how he can understand logic? This is very clear logic.Tathādehāntara-prāptir dhīrastatrana...[Bg.2.13],dhīraḥ,one who is sober, coolheaded, he understands. ""Yes, it is all right."""
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I have taken quite a lot of your time, if you'll excuse me.",Prabhupāda,"No, my time is for this purpose, provided you kindly take it. But if you don't take it, then of course, that is a different thing. My time is spent for... I have dedicated my life for this purpose. I am touring all over the world giving this knowledge. It is sound logic. If you don't accept, you must give better logic, what you know. Don't think we are going under sentiment. Don't think like that. We have got sound logic."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):I won't say that, but I'm not mentally prepared to that extent.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right, but if you are not prepared, then you learn how to become prepared. Then the same conclusion comes, that logic, you can give to the animals, but he cannot take it."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I don't think that logic can explain anything.,Prabhupāda,"No, logic cannot. But still as much logic you require, that logic is there."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Yes, but I don't know what Mr. Howard wants logic about, I don't know. But logic cannot explain anything and everything. And if mathematics or arithmetic, if we go through them, at one stage we can prove ten is equal to zero or nine is equal to zero. It is also possible by step by step...",Prabhupāda,"That may be possible, but it has no practical use. It has no practical use. If the banker gives you zero and you accept nine, then it is practical. But if you theoretically say all these things, that you may keep it in your pocket, but practically it has no use. Nine equal to zero and two equal to zero. That is not practical use."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):As far as logic, I don't think logic can explain anything and everything.",Prabhupāda,"No, then it is skepticism. There is no progress of knowledge. There is no progress of knowledge. As far as man can understand, as Mr., you are Mr. Bannerji?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Mr. Howler. (?),Prabhupāda,"Howler? Yes. So, there is little logic there, as a human being can understand. That's all. And if we accept this theory, that logic, our logic is imperfect, we cannot understand, then we have to accept authority. Just like a child. Mother says, ""Here is your father."" There is no logic. There is no logic. He has to accept. Only the mother version is logic, That's all. Authority. Is it not?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Yes, that's true.",Prabhupāda,"Then where there is no logic, the authority must be accepted. Therefore we accept that authority.Śabda-pramāṇa.The best evidence.Śabda-pramāṇa.There are different evidences. Out of that,veda-pramāṇa,śabda-pramāṇais first class. All right, thank you very much.Jaya."
Mukunda,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, Pearl has been attending our temple and following the regulative principles.",Prabhupāda,Very good.
Mukunda,And she wants to become initiated.,Prabhupāda,Oh yes.
Pearl:,Pearl:I would like to have a Sanskrit name too please.,Prabhupāda,"Oh yes, you'll have."
Pearl:,Pearl:Thank you.,Prabhupāda,You'll have. You like to be bald-headed?
Pearl:,"Pearl:(laughs) No, I think I'll keep my hair if you don't mind. I can't give up everything.",Prabhupāda,All right.
Pearl:,"Pearl:If my leg could be healed, and I want to advance spiritually.",Prabhupāda,"Well, leg, you are different from leg. Yes. Even leg is not healed, you can be healed."
Pearl:,Pearl:You mean healed spiritually.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That is real healing.
Pearl:,Pearl:Because it's keeping me from things I should be doing you see. I can't meet all my responsibilities through it.,Prabhupāda,"Give me little water. When they come to logic, when they give logic. (laughter)"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Prabhupāda, they don't want any.",Prabhupāda,That is the dog's obstinacy. That is the mentality.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):They lost their intelligence, by this civilization or by this culture.",Prabhupāda,"Yes.Adānta-gobhir,by losing that intelligence they are going to the hell. They do not know it.Adānta-gobhirviśatāṁtamisram[SB7.5.30].By uncontrolled senses... Because as soon as they come to spiritual life, they have to control senses. So that they do not like. That is very difficult."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Like he said: ""I'm not prepared for that.""",Prabhupāda,Yes. Actually they are not prepared. Then you suffer.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Then you try to be prepared.,Prabhupāda,"They are not prepared because as soon as they understand that they are going to be one these varieties of life, they shudder. Therefore they do not like to understand this. If by logic I prove that you are going to be a dog next life, that is very difficult. Just like one astrologer has said that Jawaharlal Nehru has become a dog in Sweden. You know that?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):No, I don't.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. In Delhi, one astrologer."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Delhi, some astrologer said?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):What does the government of India say about that, any comment?",Prabhupāda,That I do not know.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Are they going to worship there? (laughter),Prabhupāda,"Well, they do not believe in astrology. Therefore they cannot take any step. They do not believe in next life, so they cannot take any step. And whether it is a fact or not, because they do not believe in next life, so what is the use of taking step? Is it as good as to say that Jawaharlal Nehru has becomeIndra. If somebody says like that, so they'll have to discard this thing also, and they have to discard that thing also. Because they do not believe in the next life. Simply by presentingBhagavad-gītāas it is, we can defy all these rascals. Everything is there.Bhagavad-gītāwas not presented as it is. That is the defect. The first thing is:tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Nobody understands. And they are students ofBhagavad-gītā.EvenGandhi, he did not understand,dehāntara-prāptiḥ.All these political leaders, they do not understand what isdehāntara-prāptiḥ.What do you think,BhadraKṛṣṇa? Thedehāntara-prāptiḥ,do they understand?"
Bhadra,BhadraKṛṣṇa:It's not something known.,Prabhupāda,Yes. They do not understand.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):(Bengali) Gandhiji, he was politician, he was actually not devotee, and he could not understandBhagavad-gītā.But how the name ofRāmahas come when he died? The name ofRāma,HareRāma, has come from his last word. How it has come. It is, it is...",Prabhupāda,"Practice, practice.Raghupatirāghavarājārāma."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):So that came at the last word.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):It is due to his pious or practice.,Prabhupāda,"Practice. That will act, that will act, that will act."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):So this was my question about how, he was not acting, but...,",Prabhupāda,"No. He did not know. But because he was chantingraghupatirāghavarājārāma,that has given him this effect, yes. On account of chanting. But he really did not understand. Just like the same example, the Mohammedan. He said""hārāma."" He wanted to speak""hārāma,"" but it become""hārāma."" That is the... He did not know anything aboutRāma, but the nameRāmais so powerful that although he said,""hārāma,"" it effected. Yes. ButGandhimay not know the purpose ofBhagavad-gītā,but as he chanted""hārāma,"" that has been effective."
Pearl:,"Pearl:I wondered what ""Rāma"" meant when we say themantra,HareRāma, you see.",Prabhupāda,Rāmameans...
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):So it was not due to his pious activities, but only he was practicing.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is pious activity, that is pious activity."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):That is why at the time of death he spokeRāma,raghupatirāghavarājārāma.",Prabhupāda,He was a pious man.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):He was pious man.,Prabhupāda,Undoubtedly.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):So he chanted ""Rāma"" in practice.",Prabhupāda,"Daily he was chantingraghupatirāghavarājārāma.So...,"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):(indistinct),Prabhupāda,Yes. Where this chanting effect will go? Yes. The chanting...HareKṛṣṇa. But I mean to say that he could not teach whatRāma.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):(laughs) No.,Prabhupāda,"That is his misfortune. But in spite of his misfortune, because he was practiced to chant the name ofRāma, he was pious. Although he was ignorant. He was absorbed in thought of politics. He should have, if he would have understood thatRāmais a fact,Kṛṣṇais a fact... That he did not understand. Then he would have preached the glories ofRāma, glories ofKṛṣṇa. He took the chanting ofRāmafor his political purposes. He utilized for political purpose. Just like... That isnāma-aparādha.Samaḥśubha-kriyāmatipramāṇaḥ(?). He was trying to get some material profit by chanting the holy name ofRāma. That he got, material profit. He was the most famous politician, all over the world."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):But he did not accept any post, you know that? At the same time...,",Prabhupāda,"But he also accepted ""Mahatma"" although what..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But not political post.,Prabhupāda,"That is another trick, it may be. Or he did not like. It may be. Because he was so great, what is the presidency? Presidency elected post for five years. But he was recognized all over the world as a great leader. That is greater than any president's post or prime minister's post. So that is not much. But the thing is that if he was actually aware of the importance ofRāma, that he did not. He took it, ""Rāma"" as some means for his political purpose. But still it effected. At the time of death he said, ""Rāma."" So..."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):So you think he has gone to heaven or some, what is his position?",Prabhupāda,"No... But because he did not understandRāma, therefore he cannot go to the kingdom of God. But he'll get very high position."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):High position.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. He may go to the heavenly planet"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:He said he's still in the material world. Heavenly planets is still the material world.,Prabhupāda,"Heaven is in the material world. Heaven is in the material world. You can get greater standard of life, greater duration of life, that's all. Higher standard of life. Just likeBrahmā. Brahmā's one day you cannot calculate. He's so powerful, how he's created this universe. But he is in the material world. He's also a living entity like us, but very exalted. So he cannot get the post ofBrahmā. But he can get life in higher planetary system. That is certain. That is explained in the, find out that verse. That is explained in the...um. That verse,yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyateśucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgehe[Bg.6.41].But he did not understandBhagavad-gītā,that's a fact."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But what about this position of Vālmīki orRāmāyaṇa?,Prabhupāda,They went to the kingdom of God. They knew what isRāma.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):They knew.,Prabhupāda,Yes. They are not in vague understanding.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):They wouldn't be able to writeRāmāyaṇaif he didn't understand LordRāmacandra?,Prabhupāda,Yes. He had meditated for sixty thousands of years.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):But I think it wasGandhiwho said thatKurukṣetrais this body, five Pāṇḍavas is the five senses and this is all interpretation concoction.",Prabhupāda,"(laughs) He did not understand, that's a fact. But even this child, he does not understand, but if he chantsHareKṛṣṇa, that will be effective. If he understands or not understand. It doesn't matter."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):The name is so powerful.,Prabhupāda,Yes. What is that?
Pradyumna,Prāpyapuṇya-kṛtāṁlokān.,Prabhupāda,"Ah,prāpyapuṇya-kṛtāṁlokān.This is the... Sopuṇya-kṛtāṁlokānmeans heavenly planet.Prāpyapuṇya-kṛtāṁlokān.You cannot go to the heavenly planet unless you are very pious. So he's promoted in heavenly planet where the duration of life is very long, standard of living is very nice. But there is noKṛṣṇaconsciousness. What is that,prāpyapuṇya-kṛtāṁlokān?"
Pradyumna,Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ[Bg.6.41].,Prabhupāda,Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ.For a very long time. Because to get life in the heavenly planets means at least ten thousands of years. In their calculation. Their one day is equal to six months. In that way ten thousand years.Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ.What is it?Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ?
Pradyumna,"Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ,śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgeheyoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate[Bg.6.41].",Prabhupāda,"Then, again they come down to this material world and he takes birth either in a very exaltedbrāhmaṇafamily,śucīnām,or very rich,vaiśyafamily. After enjoying there, again he's given chance to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. And if he misses, then again he goes down. Therefore NarottamadāsaṬhākura says these are all false elevation. If I have to come again back, again I have to accept another lower grade life, then what is the profit?Kṛṣṇagives His straight understanding,tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmeti:[Bg.4.9] You becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. After the giving up this body, no more material body either in the heavenly planet or in the lower hellish planet. ""You come direct to Me."" That is perfection. You should not be attracted by somebody has gone to heavenly planet for ten thousands of years living. We should not be attracted by these things. Therefore PrabodhānandaSarasvatīsays,kaivalyaṁnarakāyatetridaśa-purākāśa-puṣpāyate.Tridaśa-purmeans the heavenly planets.Ākāśa,it is just like will of the wisp. Something, just like, what do you say Hindi? There are many proverbs, which has no existence. Just like in Bengali we sayghoḍā-ḍima.Ghoḍa-ḍima. Ḍimameans egg. The horse never lays down egg. But the word is running on: ""the egg of horse."" So it has no existence but the word is there. Similarly, what do you say in Hindi? Something which has no existence but it is current. I think there is."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Hawaikila(?).,Prabhupāda,"Hawaikila,yes.Hawaikilameans in the air there is a fort. It is something like, theVaiṣṇavaconsiders the heavenly planets, thathawaikila.That's all."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):This rich birth is important for self-realization?,Prabhupāda,Next birth?
Devotees:,"Devotees:Rich birth, to be born in a rich family.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. But there is facility. Because people are harassed for getting food and shelter. Everyone is working so hard where to get nice food, where to get nice shelter. Rich man means he has already got. So if he's sane, if he's good, has got good association, direction, then he can think, that ""I have no anxiety for my food, shelter and other necessities of life. So how I shall utilize my time?"" And if he gets goodguru, then he can utilize very nicely, chantingHareKṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is a chance. He hasn't got to work. Because people are very much perplexed how to get shelter, how to get food. But he has got the chance. He hasn't got to endeavor for food and shelter and other necessities of the body. Ample he has got. He can save time for spiritual advancement. That is an advantage. It is not necessary. It is almost disadvantage. But actually it is advantage. Unfortunately, those who are born in rich family, they take advantage of it that ""I have got so much money, let me enjoy sense gratification.""Māyādictates, ""Oh, you have got so much money. Utilize for wine-woman."" That's all."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):People say about UrayaKaranSingh...,Prabhupāda,KaranSingh?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):...of Kashmir, he's a very pious man, and because rich birth and he is a pious as well, is it?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Very religious and...,Prabhupāda,"No, I have seen him. He's religious temperament. Not very. He lovesKṛṣṇa. No, he's a good man."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Likes theBhagavad-gītā.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, he's a good man. He's good scholar also, educated."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):He was coming but I don't know why he has not come due to this...? This last year hearingBhāgavatamdiscourses he accepted he would come come. We got his letter also.,Prabhupāda,This is due to government post.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):And he also accepted an invitation, we invited him, He said he'd also come, but this Pakistan war started.",Prabhupāda,"Still there are so many respectable person came. The governor came, the high-court justices and that, the Canadian ambassador came. Many men came. And he was very humble. Hesatdown below."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):You didn't see the high commissioner there. Hesatdown.,Prabhupāda,He's also a very nice man.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Maybe some pious activities that they have.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But this is their duty to respect.,Prabhupāda,"[break] ...in this planet. In order to be elevated to the kingdom of God, they cannot go directly from the heavenly planet. They'll have to come here."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):There are many stories inMahābhārata.Many, many kings, they went to heavenly planets and from there. Many stories.",Prabhupāda,Kṣīṇepuṇyemartya-lokaṁviśanti[Bg.9.21].You have gotprasāda?Not yet. Come on. Any more? Any more? Another? Come on. (end) What else?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:The vegetable.,Prabhupāda,What type vegetable?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Cauliflower and peas and everything.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, they have got cauliflower?"
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:Yes, they have cauliflower and tomatoes.",Prabhupāda,So you can give also twoparāṭāsto me.
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:Now, you mean.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. And milk, you have got?"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:So I'll bring it down. [break],Prabhupāda,These are our books. You have seen?
Professor:,"Professor:Yes, sir, I've seen... Some of them, I've seen. This one in particular I have seen.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. We are... This isŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.There are sixty volumes, books like this."
Professor:,Professor:Sixty volumes like this?,Prabhupāda,Yes. Sixty volumes. And you can see how we are doing Sanskrit.
Professor:,Professor:Transliteration.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Transliteration and word meaning, then translation, then purport."
Professor:,"Professor:Yes, I've studied the text myself.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Professor:,Professor:I've studied the text myself.,Prabhupāda,I see. You have studied? How do you like it?
Professor:,"Professor:Yes, I like it very much.",Prabhupāda,Thank you.
Professor:,Professor:I'm very interested in thebhakti.,Prabhupāda,Which one you have studied?
Professor:,"Professor:Oh, well, I haven't read all of theBhāgavataPurāṇa,but of course, this Tenth Chapter I read.",Prabhupāda,Tenth Canto?
Professor:,"Professor:Yes, the Tenth Canto I read. And other parts, other parts also.",Prabhupāda,"Oh. We have begun from the First Canto,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].You show him the verse,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].This is First."

No. Father's duty, to arrange for their food, for their dress, for their shelter, at the same time, to see that they are growing nice, not rascals. That is father's duty.

So difference is that He is so powerful, He can maintain every living entity. He's maintaining the elephants in Africa, who eat, at a time, forty kilos. He's supplying food. There's no scarcity of food in the jungle for the elephants. Neither there is scarcity... In the hole of your room, you'll find hundreds and thousands of <span class=""Italic"">ui.</span> Who is feeding them, within the hole? Unless they're eating, sleeping, the same thing are there. How they are living very nicely? But who is giving them food within the hole? A small hole. You did not provide that hole. You did not provide their food. But there are hundreds and millions of ants. They're living there within the hole very happily. Sometimes they come out. We see: ""Oh, wherefrom so many hundreds coming?""

He's supplying food. So there are 8,400,000 different forms of living entities. Out of that, 400,000 are human beings. Out of that, many are uncivilized. The uncivilized aborigines live in the jungle. They have no economic problem. They're also human being. They never come to city for food. They are maintaining themselves. The elephants are maintaining. The ants are maintaining. Why the civilized, a few men, they have got so problem, so many problems? Because they... We are not the only living entities. There are 8,400,000 different forms of living entities. They're all being maintained by the Supreme Lord.

So why are you talking of this over-population, scarcity of food? Why? Actually the father is God. He's maintaining. And factually we see how many human beings, civilized human beings, are there. The other living beings are many hundred thousand times bigger quantity. If they can be maintained by God, what we have done, that He'll not maintain us? He'll maintain us. He's maintaining. So many people they say, ""India is starving."" I am Indian. I never see any man starving and died. I've never seen. This is simply advertisement. What is your opinion?</div>

Now there will be a big meeting on the 12th, September, how to organize. Because this kind of literature was there, there was none before this. The <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/bhakti"" class=""d"">bhakti</a></span> cult, this was never presented to the western countries.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Ambassador:</span> Yes, yes. Mostly it was Vivekananda's explanation.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Neither Vivekananda nor any swami. That is the regrettable fact. They, actually... Even Dr. Radhakrishnan, he could not present <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> as it is. You see? He's impersonalist, and he presented in a different way, and now Professor, Dr. Pirindher...?</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. Because everyone has speculated in his own way.

But because it was not presented as it is, there was not a single devotee of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. You find out, the whole history. <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is meant for making the reader a devotee of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>.
