Brahmānanda,"I think there... That boy, Ranchor, his father said, ""You leaveKṛṣṇaconsciousness and I will give you a car and women.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Your father also said like that. (laughter) Here father will feel shame to advise the son, or the son will feel shame to talk about sex with father or mother."
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"About sex one can talk with friends, not with father and mother."

Brahmānanda,"In the morning, we took.",Prabhupāda,You have taken?
Brahmānanda,Oh yes.,Prabhupāda,So where is your oil?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:I have it. [break] (end),Prabhupāda,"...for others it is said. ForKṛṣṇa, it is mercy. Thegopīscame with lust. They became purified with Kṛṣṇa's association.Gopīsactually, superficially, externally, they are, means,nitya-siddha,ever-liberated expansion of Kṛṣṇa's energy, internal energy. But apparently, they left their father, husband and came toKṛṣṇa. So that is, from Vedic principle, it is wrong. One young girl cannot go to other young man, giving up the protection of father, brother, and... So they did it. So they, according to Vedic principle, it is sinful. But because it was related withKṛṣṇa, they became purified. That means any way, if one comes in contact withKṛṣṇa, he becomes purified. Even though he's sinful. That is Kṛṣṇa's... That is the benefit ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Sun is never infected. Rather, the infected area becomes sterilized by the sunshine. This is the process. That is explained.Tejīyasāṁnadoṣāya[SB10.33.29].One who is very powerful, he has no fault. So how your temperature is going on?"

Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:It looks like an American neighborhood.,Prabhupāda,Yes. It is very nice place. So you are also helping Tejas?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,That's nice.

Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:...and the American ambassador.,Prabhupāda,If IndiraGandhicomes one day...
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,...that will be very nice.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:We're thinking if we can get either one of those two, then everyone else will come very easily. They'll give money, everything.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. It is very nice. IndiraGandhiknows our movement. Is it not? Yes, she knows."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yes. I approached her that you are the great, the greatest emissary ofKṛṣṇa, of Indian culture outside of India. So...",Prabhupāda,That is a fact. But these rascals do not appreciate it. Others are appreciating.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"The foreign countries, they're appreciating, ""Here is real Indian culture."" They should also appreciate by the result."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yes, that's the point.",Prabhupāda,"By the result, not theoretical."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:No. So we were showing pictures and books.,Prabhupāda,"Hmm. Every sane man should appreciate. When European and American young men, who are after material sense gratification, they're takingsannyāsa,it is not joke. They should appreciate it. In an age where material sense enjoyment is very prominent, and they give up everything forKṛṣṇa, and they're going far away from their comfortable position... Just likeBrahmānandahas gone to Africa. So what for? Unless they appreciateKṛṣṇaconsciousness, how they take up this job? This is practical. There is no question of theoretical."
Brahmānanda,You said that last night when you spoke that about we are actuallysiddhas.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,We are not...,Prabhupāda,That I wanted to prove... (laughs)

Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Let her think that we are praising her leadership of the country.,Prabhupāda,"No. Yes, flatter that ""You can say that you'll be glorified when India will be glorified. So this culture will glorify India."""

Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"""This is India's original culture,Kṛṣṇaculture."" And ninety-percent of the people, they areKṛṣṇadevotees, of India. There is no doubt about it."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,So... And this has got the potency of being spread all over the world. All over the world.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Hm. Yes.,Prabhupāda,Some news has come out inJugantarthat Queen Elizabeth is reading ourBhagavad-gītā.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:That was from that time David Wynne gave her thatBhagavad-gītā.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:...to read while she was sitting for him for the sculpture.,Prabhupāda,So it has come to her attention.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:I think he has told that story to several people and the word has spread.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Brahmānanda,Where did you hear it from?,Prabhupāda,"Anyway, that, our, our architect, that..."
Brahmānanda,"Surabhi. Oh, Mr. Lahiri.",Prabhupāda,He has seen in theJugantar Press.
Brahmānanda,You're kidding!,Prabhupāda,And the latest report is thatBhagavad-gītāis selling fifteen thousand copies per month in London. Who told me? Thirty-thousand copies sold in two months.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:It was MacMillan's biggest selling book in England.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That also you can inform her. And present her one copy.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Yes. One copy ofBhāgavata.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:I gave her one copy of...,Prabhupāda,Who arranged this meeting?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Well, we did. We just went.",Prabhupāda,Oh.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:And with the American Ambassador, we have left him today one copy ofBhagavad-gītā.",Prabhupāda,Oh.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:And tomorrow we can...,Prabhupāda,"You can refer that Mr., what is his, last ambassador?"
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Keath, Keating.",Prabhupāda,Keating.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yes, I already have given him one copy...",Prabhupāda,He knows us very well.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Where is that...? He gave us some letter?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:We gave already that copy to the ambassador.,Prabhupāda,He liked this movement.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Also I gave the papers...,Prabhupāda,"And ""We are American. You can ask about this movement."""
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yes, I said that also. I said, ""Because most of your disciples are American, and you are an American practically...""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Ah. ""So you can test us. You can test us."""
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Also politically speaking, now it is time Mrs., Mrs.Gandhiis being criticized now by Hindus because she took sides with these Arabs during this war.",Prabhupāda,Hm. She is very highly criticized.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:So she needs to get some political benefit from associating with Hindus during some functions just now.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That will counteract.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:""And also he needs that association with India leaders. Because America is...""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. If she comes, then we shall have to give a nice speech so that she may be convinced."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yes. Very flatter... I think, I think we should flatter her completely.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:No controversy. And this...,Prabhupāda,"No, that, ""If you becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, naturally everything will be correct."" Just likeYudhiṣṭhiraMahārājawasKṛṣṇaconscious.

So by the grace ofKṛṣṇa, you are on the post ofYudhiṣṭhiraMahārāja. So if you take standard, it will be good for everyone. And so far secular state is concerned, we are actually secular. In this movement, all classes of men are here."""
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you'll have to preach to her. Because she won't listen to... If I can just get her to agree to be the chief guest.",Prabhupāda,And accept the book. That is all right.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:That's all I can do.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:If you preach to her, she'll listen.",Prabhupāda,Yes. yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:But she won't listen if I preach to her.,Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. That is not possible. That I know. You simply try to..."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Induce her to come.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, to join us at least one day."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"And accept the book, read it, at least the introductory portion, preface portion."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:I can show her politically how it would be advantageous for her to come. That much I can do.,Prabhupāda,"I, I... I don't think you should advise him, her..."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:I mean I don't need to really.,Prabhupāda,...about politics.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:She knows it. She knows that you... And also this American ambassador could use some favorable publicity.,Prabhupāda,"No, thisBhagavad-gītācontains everything—politics, sociology, religion, philosophy. So this culture should be spread; this India's culture, original culture, should be spread. And we are endeavoring that. And it is becoming successful."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Also we are meeting the Minister of Defence, JagjivanaRama. And Dr.KaranSingh is coming back on Monday. He's been out. And Kumar Shankara Diksit tomorrow morning also, the Minister of...",Prabhupāda,Kumar Shankara Diksit.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:...Home Affairs. Minister of Home Affairs.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Big post.,Prabhupāda,"Well, these politicians are politicians. Anyway, we..."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:At least, if they come, everything will be successful.",Prabhupāda,"Indira, simply IndiraGandhicomes, it will be tremendous success."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes. Crowds will come. People will donate money for thepandala.,Prabhupāda,So when thepandalawill be erected?
Tejas:,"Tejas:It will begin on the fourth, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Devotee:,Devotee:It will begin on the fourth.,Prabhupāda,"That place is nice, but it is not as public as the L.I.C."
Tejas:,"Tejas:We need some... For that reason, we need some very good chief guest and some good publicity.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:We arranged some newspaper publicity today. So... And he's arranged banners and posters and... Enough people will come.,Prabhupāda,You have got some fruits?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Mostly, I think they'll come because they remember before, when you were here... [break] (end)",Prabhupāda,Yes. [break] It is there?
Pradyumna,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Where it is quoted from?
Pradyumna,"Quoted fromBhāgavatam, ŚrīmadBhāgavatam,1.10.11.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Pradyumna,"First Canto, Tenth Chapter, Eleventh Verse.",Prabhupāda,Make note there.
Pradyumna,Translation?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Pradyumna,"""The intelligent, who have understood the Supreme Lord in association with pure devotees and have become freed from bad materialistic association can never avoid hearing the glories of the Lord even though they have heard them only once.""",Prabhupāda,Hm. So this will protect you from the influence ofmāyā.Read that again.
Pradyumna,Sanskrit or translation.,Prabhupāda,Translation.
Brahmānanda,"Well, it means... I thought it had something to do with civil servants, where they all live in a dormitory and eat in a large hall.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Brahmānanda,And they all contribute...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,...part of their salary.,Prabhupāda,"So if you make that association, that will not help you. Joint mess, dormitory. Or joint family. Just like in India. There are five brothers. They're earning. Father and mother is the leader. They're handing over the money, and the father, mother managing. That is Indian system, a joint family. So joint family or joint mess, the same thing. So if you make like that, a center, then it is no good. You must get spiritual strength.Karmīstrength will not help you. What they are doing in Babar(?) Road, these girls?"
Guru,Gurudāsa:They're preparing someśṛṅgārafor Deity.,Prabhupāda,"Why not here? Why go to Babar Road, spend twenty rupees?"
Guru,"Gurudāsa:According to them, that sometimes they have to go in the center of town.",Prabhupāda,"Nobody has intelligence. It will not, it will not stay. It will be spoiled. Joint mess organization. In Los Angeles, they're also doing business. They're going to sell books. But regulative principle is observed. Huge expenditure they have got. No center is so improved as Los Angeles. We have purchased six houses. And I wanted immediately two lakhs, immediately sent. You cannot pay. You simply want to take. In India, nobody can pay. If I want two lakhs, nobody can pay. But all this money have been taken from U.S.A. I askedBaliMardana, I asked Karandhara. They paid me for this Bombay affair, sixteen, eighteen lakhs. [break] ...and breathing also does not stop. It goes very slow. Therefore he cannot be immortal. AndBhagavad-gītāproposes, that is wonderful thing, if you can stop death. And whole spiritual life means how to stop death. That isBhāgavata'sinstruction, ""Don't acceptguru, don't accept father, don't accept, or don't be father, don't be mother, don't be, if you cannot stop death."" Either you don't accept, or don't become. Just like they wantguru. So don't accept aguruwho cannot stop your death. And from guru's side, it is advised, ""Don't becomeguruif you cannot stop the death of your disciple."" This isBhāgavatam'sstatement. So ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is to stop death, live eternally withKṛṣṇa, go back to home, back to Godhead. This is our movement. So ourgurugives us this opportunity, no more death.Tyaktvā...After leaving this body, you don't accept any more material body. And if you don't accept material body, then there is no death. As soon as your spiritual, you remain in spiritual body, there is no death. There is no birth also. Death is concomitant where birth is there. If the death is stopped, then there is no birth. And if there is no birth, there is no disease, there is no old age. This is the process. So birth, death, old age, disease can be stopped only byKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So if you don't like to beKṛṣṇaconscious then what is the use of becoming your disciple, and if theguru, if he cannot stop your death, birth and death, then what is your becomingguru?So 'mṛtatvāyakalpate.Yaṁhinavyathayantyetepuruṣaṁpuruṣarṣabha.Find out this verse.Yaṁhinavyathayantyete."
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Y-a-m?,Prabhupāda,"Yeah, y-a-m.Yaṁhi...Get this light on. [break] ...there is birth and death and old age and... That is liberation. That issiddhi.That is perfection. These rascals are making plans, material plans. Jawaharlal Nehru made plan of this New Delhi. But he is kicked out. ""Go out!"" And now he has become a dog in Switzerland."
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:In Sweden.,Prabhupāda,In Sweden.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:He's one of two dogs in Sweden.,Prabhupāda,Yes. ŚrīdharaMahārājatold me. Some astrologer has...
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Ah.,Prabhupāda,"So they, these so-called leaders are so fools that they... Therefore they don't believe in next life. Because that is very horrible for them. But the next life is there. Just like we, we, we have our next life. We had our previous life, then now another life, another life. So this simple thing they cannot understand. Nature is controlling this, next life, next life. Otherwise why so many varieties of life? So they have no brain. They are simply making plan for the fifty years duration of life. That's all. And even from practical point of view, suppose you are constructing a very nice house, and if you know that next day you'll be kicked out, you'll die, will you do that? But it is a fact. Next day or two days after, you'll die. That's a fact. So first of all, make arrangement that you'll not die, you'll be able to live here. That is their foolishness."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Sometimes they take refuge in the idea that: ""My family will live on,"" or ""My species..."" or ""my...""",Prabhupāda,That's...
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:""...children...""",Prabhupāda,"...all right. The family will live on not forever. They'll live also, say, for few days. Just we go sometimes in... Just like in England, the castles are there, very old castle, thousand years, two thousand... Even this Westminster Abbey and palace, but which king has lived for there permanently? And now, if you know more, if the king has, by his work, become something else. Not necessarily he'll become a king in that house. He may become a dog there. This science they do not know. And they are proud of their education, culture. Suppose we are constructing theVṛndāvanatemple or Bombay temple. It is also certain we shall not live, but our attempt to construct that temple will be recorded inKṛṣṇa."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"Yes. ""Because he has spent his energy for My service."" That will be our gain. Others, they, whatever they are working...Kovārtha āpto 'bhajatāṁsva-dharmataḥ.Find out this verse.Kovā.Kovārtha āpto 'bhajatāṁsva-dharmataḥ.This is inBhāgavata."
Devotee:,Devotee:Bhāgavata.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Does that guarantee that he'll become a devotee again?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Because he had already practiced. So if he, if he remembers, if he's intelligent, that ""I've got this nice position, according tośāstra,because I had some good devotional activities in my past life. Now let me finish. I'll not fall down. I have no economic problem. I have got so much facilities. So let me advance inKṛṣṇaconsciousness."" If he gets this... He'll get that sense."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:He automatically gets that standard.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Hm.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:So he must come back to that point again, starting there.",Prabhupāda,Just like you have given. Your children are given the good chance.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Ah yeah.,Prabhupāda,"The Sarasvatī's given chance. Now he's, from very childhood, she's chantingHareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare..."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:yes.,Prabhupāda,"He's criticizing: ""Mālatī, this old man is smoking."" He's getting thesaṁskārafrom the childhood, as we got it from good father. Yes. So here is a chance. And that will not... It is not childish, Sarasvatī's chantingHareKṛṣṇa. In London, she would finish sixteen rounds?"
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Six.,Prabhupāda,Six. She was... Just see. She has got determination.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,And all the children. So that will not go in vain.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:No.,Prabhupāda,"Never go in vain. This is her... She had executed devotional service in her past life. Therefore from the very beginning of her life, she's in association ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, very beginning. This is the chance. Now it is the duty of the father and mother, and when she grows up it is her duty to finish this business, go to back to home. This is chance. So where is the loss? Even she failed last life, then where is the loss? She's getting another chance, whereas the ordinarykarmīs,they'll not get that chance. That is explained. Read it."
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:One who has forsaken his material occupation to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything.",Prabhupāda,That is the translation. Purport?
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:""Purport: As far as the duties of mankind are concerned. There are innumerable duties. Every man is duty-bound, not only to his parents, family members, society, country, humanity, other living beings, the demigods, etc., but also to the great philosophers, poets, scientists etc. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one can relinquish all such duties and surrender unto the service of the Lord. So if one does so and becomes successful in the discharge of his devotional service unto the Lord, it is well and good. But it so happens sometimes that one surrenders himself unto the service of the Lord by some temporary sentiment and in the long run, due to so many other reasons, he falls down from the path of service by undesirable association. There are so many instances of this in the histories.BharataMahārājawas obliged to take his birth as a stag due to his intimate attachment to a stag. He thought of this stag when he died. As such, in the next birth he became a stag, although he did not forget the incidents of his previous birth. SimilarlyCitraketualso fell down due to his offense...""",Prabhupāda,"Therefore we forbid to take to thekarmī'slife. Because at the time of death, if he remains akarmī,then he'll have to take birth as akarmī.That is the risk. So this regulated life, holding class, chanting, that will not make us fall down. That is essential. It is essential, regulate, to follow the regulative principles, chanting sixteen rounds, holding class. You can do anything, but this will keep us alive to theKṛṣṇaconsciousness platform. If you neglect that, then that is very risky. Even if you get next life birth in a rich man's family, that is not guarantee. Because generally, rich man's sons, they go astray. They get money for nothing and they want to squander it. And material world, if you have got money, so many bad associates will come and help you to squander your money and spoil your life. Because you have got money, then so many friends will come. As soon as you have no money, nobody will come. Even your wife, children will not come. Thereforehariṣyetaddhanaṁśanaiḥ.Kṛṣṇa, first of all, takes away the money, makes him poor so that everyone will neglect him, and because he'sKṛṣṇaconscious, he'll takeKṛṣṇa, ""Sir, I have no other alternative. Please give me protection."" That is also another Kṛṣṇa's policy, special favor, that ""This man wanted Me. Now he's going astray. All right. That's all right. Take everything of his..."""
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Like that man Patrick. Three businesses failed.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That was my case also. Since myGuruMahārājaordered me that ""You do this."" But I thought that ""Let me become first of all rich man. Then I shall do,"" so He... Every business was..."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Maybe that is my case also.,Prabhupāda,"That is special favor. In the beginning I was thinking, ""Now my godbrothers, they have takensannyāsa.They are begging from door to door. Why shall I beg? Let me earn money and startKṛṣṇaconsciousness."" But that never happened. So I had to... I was obliged to take the dress of my godbrothers and preach, instead of earning money. Yes. Some astrologer told me that I should have been a man like a Birla. And I got all those chances in the chemical line, to become... Now I am bigger than Birla. That's all right. But even in business field, there were signs that in money things... I got so many good chances. But everything... Dr. KarttikaCandraBose he appreciated my activities, ""Very intelligent boy."" He certified to my father-in-law. This is the way of becoming rich man."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:What happened?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Why didn't...,Prabhupāda,"Something happened, and everything was finished. That is Kṛṣṇa's grace. Just like something has happened wonderful. So that is also Kṛṣṇa's grace."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:People stopped purchasing...?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:People stopped purchasing...?,Prabhupāda,"No. Just like Dr. Bose's laboratory. So Dr. Bose's laboratory, I was manager. Then I took his agency, very good terms. I was earning money like anything. But the next manager, he became envious. He began to poison Dr. Bose, to cut off our relationship. So it happened. Then, when I was Dr. Bose's agent, I become so much famous that Bengal Chemical, the biggest chemical factory, he, they wanted to give me the agency. If I would have taken that agency, I would have been the richest man in the chemical world. You see. But they made some condition. So I did not accept it. I wanted in my condition. That is the very little... But I was puffed-up, that ""I am such a big... And this man is flattering. So I must get my condition fulfilled."" So I did not accept it. The Smith Stanstreet gave me agency. Because in my work, in Dr. Bose's laboratory, I did it very creditably. So every other manufacturers, they became attracted to me, how to get me. The Smith Stanstreet Company, Bikepala(?) Company, Bose's, Bengal Chemical Company, they all wanted me. And I thought, ""Oh, everyone wants me."" So, so I refused. And later on there was a clique between Dr. Bose and me. So I lost everything. Then I started my own laboratory. Somehow or other, there was something, and..."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:In Bombay, you were having your own business then?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Manufacturing?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. No, that is small manufacturing. So I got very, very good chance. ButKṛṣṇadid not allow it. He wanted me to come to this point. That is my practical experience. And now I'm seeing that it is Kṛṣṇa's so much favor. You see?Yasyāham,anugṛhnāmi...It is, it is, actually it is His grace. ""What he'll do by becoming Birla, rich man like Birla?"" That was Kṛṣṇa's plan. ""Come here. Do this work."" You see. MyGuruMahārājaordered.Kṛṣṇawanted. I was resisting Him. That's all. I was actually very expert businessman in chemical line. I did it very creditably in Bose's laboratory as manager and my own business. And everyone knows... Even in manufacturing also."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yeah, with that same experience now you've organized a world-wide society...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:And that's a big business.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,"Just like before coming to India, inJapan, with simply five thousand dollars, you took fifty thousand dollars worth of merchandise.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,"And you brought it, had it sent...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Life members...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,And then you devised the program for distributing them.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, practically India's, our, whatever we have got, it is starting with that five thousand dollars."
Brahmānanda,"But it's like you were investing, taking goods on credit, and...",Prabhupāda,Yes. And this membership became successful.
Brahmānanda,Then you devised the method for distribution.,Prabhupāda,This membership.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Even the way you went to America in the beginning. You couldn't take money.,Prabhupāda,No.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:So you had some books...,Prabhupāda,Some books. Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Publish...,Prabhupāda,"That intelligence gives me,Kṛṣṇa, ""You do this.""Buddhi-yogaṁdadāmitam.Yes. And in my materialistic life, He was taking away my intelligence. Just like this Bose, Bengal Chemical agency, I should have accepted immediately. Such a big concern. Simply by sitting, I would have brought ten thousand rupees per month in those days. But there was no good intelligence. I thought, ""No, I cannot accept your terms. You must accept..."" Because I was at that time young man, puffed-up, no brain, no sober brain. They were so attracted with me. They would have given later on all facilities, but I did not accept. Similarly, Smith Stanstreet, they were also very good company."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Smith's...?,Prabhupāda,"Smith Stanstreet, an English company. They gave me an agency. So some of my enemy... He was my, he was my employer, but he gave information that I am also manufacturing now, drug and chemical works. So they informed them that ""He's pushing his own goods, not your goods."" They... He wanted that agency. Yes. In this way, because as soon as you come in the... Even in the spiritual field, my godbrothers are envious. You see? So as soon as you become successful, there will be many enemies. That is natural. That is the sign of success. In your business, if there are many enemies, competitor, that means you are successful. So anyway,Kṛṣṇahas brought me to the right path. So I may not fall down. That's all. (laughter) When I was reading this verse, thatyasyāhamanugṛhnāmihariṣyetaddhanaṁśanaiḥ[SB10.88.8],Kṛṣṇasaid that ""When I show somebody My special favor, I take away all his money,"" I became shuddered, ""SoKṛṣṇawill take my all money? If He's..."" And actually that happened. He took my all money, all family, all friends and everything. (laughs) And He asked me, ""Go to America. You'll get many money, much money, many friends. You go ahead, Come here."" Yes. That was His intention. And I was sticking to limited money, limited friends, limited society. This is special favor."
Brahmānanda,So in Bombay you mentioned that Lilavati Munshi... There was one house...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,...and you were trying to get that house...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, and she took away."
Brahmānanda,...and you were prevented.,Prabhupāda,"She took away. Because I was trying to organize a League of Devotees from that house, andKṛṣṇawanted, ""What is this nonsense? You are stick here, in Jhansi? You come here, in open field."" That was Kṛṣṇa's intent. But I thought that ""EvenKṛṣṇatook away this?"" This Lilavati Munshi..."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Now her institution is...,Prabhupāda,But my intention was to start this movement.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"I was simply planning in different way. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's favor. I never deviated from this plan. Since I heard it from myGuruMahārāja, I've simply planning how to do it successfully. But I thought at that time, that ""I'll be able to do it if I get some money. Let me do some business for the time."" That I was thinking. ButKṛṣṇasaid, ""Even if you are pauper, you try; you'll get everything."" But I thought, ""Without money, how this can be done?"" That was difference of opinion withKṛṣṇa, argument. And I was dreaming also,GuruMahārāja, asking me, ""Come on."" So I was going. So I was, ""Oh, I have to go? I have to takesannyāsa?"""
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:You, you dreaming?",Prabhupāda,"Yes.GuruMahārājasaid, ""Come, come with me."" I was going. But that... Many things happened before this. Yes. And at last it became, in America."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Did you tell everyone you were leaving, or you simply disappeared?",Prabhupāda,"No, I never said. Oh, why shall I? I lost all friends, money, everything."
Guru,Gurudāsa:I met one gentleman from Allahabad... (Apparently someone comes in),Prabhupāda,(Hindi)
Guru,Gurudāsa:Oh.,Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇa. Get this light. [break] ...to this point, and you have joined. Do it nicely. It is the greatest movement for making the whole human civilization happy. Take it seriously. Don't..."
Tejas:,"Tejas:Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is Mister S. Domi(?) Singh, he's a... (end)",Prabhupāda,"Give up your material activities and engage yourself in spiritual activities. That ismukti.Just like a man in diseased condition, he is acting. He is also acting. He is also passing stool, passing urine, eating something, lying down, talking. He has got activities. But that activities and when he is free from the disease, that activity is different. Similarly, if you change your activity, you can becomemuktaeven in this life. That ismukti,realmukti. Muktir hitvānyathā-rūpaṁsvarūpeṇavyavasthitiḥ[SB2.10.6].If you give up your diseased conditional activities... Just like these boys who are inKṛṣṇa, they aremuktas,because they are not interested with any material activities. They are not interested to read in the morning any newspaper. No. They cannot waste their time in that way or take part in politics. No. They are simply interested in chantingHareKṛṣṇamantraand reading these books. Therefore they aremuktas.They are all liberated. Becausehitvānyathā-rūpam.Other people, they are reading newspaper, doing all nonsense, but they are not interested. Theanyathā-rūpam.That is material business.Svarūpeṇavyavasthitiḥ[SB2.10.6].Svarūpameansjīverasvarūpahayanitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa[Cc.Madhya20.108-109].Every living entity is eternallyKṛṣṇadāsa. So if you give up these material activities and engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa's service, you aremukta.That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā."
Guest (1) (Indian man):,Guest (1) (Indian man):Hundred percent.,Prabhupāda,"Hundred percent, yes. That's all.Kīrtanīyaḥsadāhariḥ[Cc. Ādi17.31].This ismukti.Any other question."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Yes. I have very many questions to ask.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that's nice. But you cannot assimilate all the answers in one day. That is not possible. You see. You have many questions, but ask in many days, not in one day. Otherwise you will get indigestion. (laughter) You will not be able to... Simply you go on questioning, questioning, and don't take anything. That is no use. Take. Make one question. Try to understand. Adopt it in life. Then make another question. Don't take all the answers at a time and become suffering in dysentery. No. (laughter) Don't do that. That's alright. You cannot take one month's food in one hour. Can you take? So that's alright. Gradually. Your questions are nice, but don't take the answers all in a day. That will be not good. If you understand very easily, then you will forget very easily."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):That is natural. Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Natural, you see. If you understand little with difficulty, then you will forget also with difficulty. This is the way. So any other question? After this question-answer? (end)"
