Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:He also says that the species are not created independently. They say it is descended from, one after another.",Prabhupāda,"So, if there is no question of independence, then how, abruptly, he can begin from a certain species? You must explain wherefrom this species came into existence.Harernāmaharernāma..."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:There are so many books on Darwin's theory. Goes... In the library, if one goes there are hundreds of volumes of books on Darwin's theory.",Prabhupāda,They have accepted or protested?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Recently, there was an issue that some people wanted that the theory that God created the earth and the species to be taught in schools along with Darwin's theory.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:But the, it was defeated because the scientists said: ""If we make such a statement in our schools, everyone will take us as fools.""",Prabhupāda,What is that? I could not follow. Eh?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:A group of, a group of people wanted that in school they should also teach that God created the earth and the people...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Not just say that it was created by chance, random biology. But scientists objected, said: ""We cannot say that God created the earth because then everyone will take us as fools."" And they defeated the measure. The scientists said ""Everyone knows. The earth is just created by biological chemistry. If we say that God created the earth, everyone will think us as fools.""",Prabhupāda,"The biology, chemistry, why don't you create? The biology and chemistry has advanced so much. Why don't you create? What is their answer?"
Karandhara:,Karandhara:In the future.,Prabhupāda,"That is their foolishness. Why future? If it is already created, biology and chemistry, and you know the process, why don't you create it by chemistry, biology?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:It is a little wet, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,So we can...
Devotee:,Devotee:It's all wet.,Prabhupāda,Therefore I do not wish to come here. There is no facility for walking. Everywhere wet.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Ahh. This is wet also. Let's go this side.,Prabhupāda,"Everywhere wet. There is a little space to walk. Biology, chemistry is the origin of life. So the chemistry, biology's so much advanced. Why they cannot create life? When the crucial point is touched, they say: ""We shall do it in future."" Why future? If it is already done at present, why future? What is this?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:This is... Small ones?,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:These are some small earth, mound of earth taken out from the inside to make room for oxygen for the plants to breath.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. These are stools."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:No, these are not stools, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There's a machine. They go around like this. And that makes a little earth taken out.",Prabhupāda,Ahhh.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They say they'll be doing in the future.,Prabhupāda,"That is nonsense. Future, that is not science. Trust no future, however pleasant. This is the word. What is this? Everyone will say future. Trust no future, however pleasant. You may think it is very pleasurable. Why future? If you say that the biology, chemistry is the beginning of this life, so you are now so much advanced. Why don't you create? Then what is the meaning of your advancement? You're talking nonsense."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They always say they're right on the verge.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They always say they're right on the verge.,Prabhupāda,"That is also the future, in a different way. You have to accept that you do not know still what is the truth. You are expecting in future. That, that is the proof that your knowledge is imperfect. Why future?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Because their present knowledge cannot...,Prabhupāda,"It is, it is something like, giving post-dated check. I pay you one lakh of rupees, post-dated. Although I have no money,... What is the value of that check? Will anybody accept that check? ""Oh, I have received the money."" That is foolishness. Why future? You are talking of future, and you are talking of perfectness at present. What is this nonsense? You are claiming that your science is perfect, and, at the same time, when practical example wanted, you say; ""I shall do it."" The same example. I am saying I am millions, owner of millions of dollars. And you ask me: ""Give me some payment."" ""Yes, I give you post-dated check."" Will you accept? At present, if you give me five dollar, I see something tangible. And you're talking of big, big word, but you'll pay me in the future. So is it very sanguine proposal? And I am to accept it? So what kind of intelligent man I am also? You cannot produce even a grass by biological chemistry. You cannot do anything. Still you are claiming: ""It is produced of chemistry, biology."" What is this nonsense? Nobody questions?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Even it's produced by chemistry, there's laws...",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:There's laws to those chemical reactions. They never consider who makes the laws?,Prabhupāda,"Then? What is this? As soon as there is law, it must be considered that somebody made the law."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:It's just a thief's mentality.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:If a thief comes on something valuable, he does not think who owns this. He simply thinks how he'll steal it.",Prabhupāda,That is thief's business.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,So they are all thieves.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So how we, a sane man can trust a thief? A sane man cannot trust a thief. There are so many things. They could not produce even a grass, even a small plant in the biology, chemistry laboratory, and still they're claiming it is product of biology, chemistry. What is this nonsenses. What kind of scientists there are?"
Locana,We couldn't even choose when we were born.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Locana,We couldn't even choose being born here.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:That is why, in the ultimate analysis, the geologists, mostly when they trace the origin of life, they say everything started from matter. Living matters came out from non-living matters.",Prabhupāda,"Where it is coming now? It came in the past and not in the now, and not at present? Wherefrom an ant is coming from this dust. Is there any proof? Even an ant does not come."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:In fact, there are several theories like that, about the origin of life. And they say starting from matter, all the living matters came from nonliving.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. Why it is not coming now, rascal? I kick on your face with boots. Why it is not coming now?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:If it happened before, it should happen now.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:And it is so amazing that people believe it.,Prabhupāda,That means fools.
Brahmā,The blind leading the blind.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31].All rascals,mūḍhāḥ.Our simple formula is: Anyone who is notKṛṣṇaconscious, he's a rascal. Never mind what he is. We immediately reject him, a rascal. Our simple formula. And actually they're rascals. They're talking like rascals, childish, that life came from matter. Prove it. That future. What is this? I am very rich man. And as soon as I ask you: ""Give me some money."" ""Oh, yes, I'll give you in future."" What is this?"
Brahmānanda,"Sometimes when we ask someone to become a life member, they say: ""Yes, sometime in future."" We become very disappointed.",Prabhupāda,We shall make vigorous propaganda against all this rascalism. That is ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement.Mūḍhāḥ.Challenge them.
Brahmānanda,"Saying ""In future"", that is a bluff.",Prabhupāda,"Bluff. That is a bluff. When that future will come? That they do not know. That is another bluff. And still, they're proud of advancement of knowledge. Still, they're talking of future. And what is your advancement?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So long as the future is there they have a voice to say...,Prabhupāda,"Future we cannot trust. Trust no future however pleasant. This is our philosophy. Everyone says that. Trust no future, however pleasant. You may talk that future is very bright, but we don't believe in that. Why future? If you are advanced, immediately..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That's old poetry?,Prabhupāda,"In the past, you say, in the past the life came out of matter. Why you again say in the future? What is this theory? You have already committed that the life began from matter. That is past, ""began."" Then why you say now again ""future?"" Then where is the beginning? Eh? Why this contradiction? If life began from matter, that is past. That is in the past. Then why do you say again future? What is the answer? Is it not contradiction?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yeah. That misses the whole point.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is whole, wholesale nonsense, wholesale nonsense. You are expecting the fact in the future, still you say it began in the past. Just see the contradiction."
Golfers:,"Golfers:Fore, fore!",Prabhupāda,So contradiction means childish. Contradiction is not scientist. Contradiction is childish.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They started from a point where...,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They started from a point where there's no background. There's no...,Prabhupāda,"No background. That is another thing. And still, they cannot prove it at present. They're expecting to prove it in the future."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:They say: ""It happened in the past, but we'll do it in the future.""",Prabhupāda,What is this nonsense?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:But who did it in the past?,Prabhupāda,"And how, how he knows that it began in the past? If he cannot prove it in the present?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They assume it.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They assume it.,Prabhupāda,"Assume, everyone can assume. That is not science. Assuming, then, everyone can suggest something like. You can suggest something, I can suggest something. What is the proof? We can prove that life begins from life. Just like father begets a child. Father is living and the child is living. That we can prove. But where is your proof that the father is a stone and the son is a child? Where is your proof? We say that life begins from life. The original life isKṛṣṇa. That we can prove. But you say that life begins from matter. Where is this evidence that a child is born out of stone."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:There's a miss... They say there's a missing link.,Prabhupāda,"A missing link? Then I kick on your face. You're missing this kick. Now learn it. Nonsense. Here is the missing point. Just learn it. Write vigorous articles to kick on the face of these rascals. All of you. You have got so much advanced laboratories, advanced knowledge. You do not... even you are defying the authority of God. You have become so great. And you cannot prove that life is coming out of matter. That you are leaving aside for future. And I have to believe such a rascal? Do you think it is nice? You are talking all nonsense, and I have to believe you?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:They say they have almost proof that some acids, they make some acids and it's almost like an animal. Just about, not quite, but almost.",Prabhupāda,"Asses, asses?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:They're almost like little animals, little cells. Not quite but almost. So they say that because that matter is almost like a little animal, therefore there must be just one little missing link, one chemical you can add, they're trying to isolate it.",Prabhupāda,"That missing link is kicking you. That missing... Here, you say, you take this missing link."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They are trying to make babies in a test tube.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:In a few years.,Prabhupāda,What is that test tube?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:In the laboratory, the chemical laboratory, biological laboratory, so they'll take the combinations of the male and the female....",Prabhupāda,Then where is the test tube? It is taken from the living entities.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Then where is the test tube? Test tube is a place for combination. As it is combined in the womb. So that is not advancement.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:The womb's already doing it very nicely.,Prabhupāda,Nicely. What is your credit?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They want to, they want to be very proud that they'll be able to do it outside the womb.",Prabhupāda,But that's all right. At least you are not able to do it now. But where is the credit because it is already being done.
Devotee:,Devotee:Yes.,Prabhupāda,In the nature's test tube.
Brahmānanda,They're just doing it in a more difficult and expensive way.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:When somebody does like that, people will give him Nobel prize.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is stated in theBhāgavata:śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥsaṁstutaḥpuruṣaḥpaśuḥ[SB2.3.19].A big animal is being praised by dogs, and hogs, camel, monkeys. So they're getting Nobel Prize from dogs, hogs, camels. They're not getting Nobel Prize from any sane man. That is stated.Śva-viḍ. Śvameans dog.Viḍ-varāhameans the stool-eater, hog.Śva-viḍ-varāhauṣṭra.Uṣṭrameans camel. Andkharaḥmeans ass. So they're being praised by these classes of animal. They're not human being. If anyone gives Nobel Prize to such rascals, that means the man, the committee, who is giving the Nobel Prize to him, they are composition of these animals, dogs, hogs, camel and ass. They are not human being. According toBhāgavata.That is explained in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.I think I have explained it."
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"They are not... We don't accept them as human beings. We accept them as animals. So one animal is being praised by other animals. That's all. And that is no credit. That means if, at the present, if anyone gets Nobel Prize, that means he's fool number one. That is the... Because the other animals are praising. No human being."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But that is the ultimate aim for the scientists.,Prabhupāda,"Eh? Scientists means they are rascals. They're talking nonsense. And because they are putting the matter in some jugglery of words, other fools are being misled."
Brahmānanda,"That Nobel Prize, the Nobel, he's the one who discovered the dynamite which has caused so much destruction in the world. But he made a big fortune. So all that money, he's now pushing for...",Prabhupāda,Another misfortune.
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"He created some misfortune, and he spent the money for creating further, more misfortunes. What can he do more?HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa... (Pause)"
Brahmānanda,"It says in theGītāthat the demoniac, they do acts, horrible acts which are meant to destroy the world.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.Ugra-karma.Kṣayāyajagato 'hitāḥ.It is meant for destruction and inauspicity of the world. This is their business.
Locana,"If scientists really believed that they were just made out of matter, then there wouldn't be any question of one scientist's thinking he's a person better than another person cause there wouldn't be any individuality, if they believed everything was just atoms and matter.",Prabhupāda,Hmm? Now here is a matter. Why leaves and twigs are not coming. Formerly it was coming. What is the difference?
Locana,The spirit soul.,Prabhupāda,"The same, it has grown green, and vegetation. Now the same wood is there. Why it is not coming now? Let scientists explain this."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That simply shows how ignorant the understanding is.,Prabhupāda,":Therefore we say rascals, simply."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Well they would say the chemical composition has been changed.,Prabhupāda,"All right, give the chemicals. You are now advanced in knowing the chemicals. Inject the chemicals."
Brahmānanda,:Knowledge means that you have to be able to demonstrate it.,Prabhupāda,:Yes. That... Otherwise what...
Brahmānanda,":Otherwise, its' just...",Prabhupāda,Ācaraṇa.It is calledācaraṇa. Āpaniācaribhaktikarilapracāra.
Brahmānanda,They should be able to demonstrate it in a laboratory.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Science says that: ""observation and experiment."" That is science. You observe how things are going on. And you experiment. Then it is perfect. But you cannot make experiment, you simply observe, that, a child also can also observe, and he can speak something nonsense. Just like in our childhood, we were observing the gramophone box, that within the box there is some man who's singing. And electric fan. I was thinking: There must be some ghost. Yes. These kind of suggestion..."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara: :The... In the first time when learn about the difference between the living and the nonliving, this is one of the very popular questions when we start biology: What is the difference between living and the nonliving? So they answer there are several points to differentiate between the two. And they say the living can move and the nonliving cannot grow or cannot move.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:And the living can reproduce like themselves.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:The nonliving is not.,Prabhupāda,No. No.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara: :But they never talk about the soul, the nature of the soul, the consciousness existing within the living.",Prabhupāda,":No, because there is consciousness, therefore the living being can create. Because I am conscious, I am thinking of marrying, begetting children. Because I am conscious. And because there is no consciousness, therefore this wood cannot think that he'll beget. The original consciousness, in the Vedas,it is said:ekobahusyām.God says: ""I'll become many,"" so because there is consciousness, therefore He's saying that: ""I shall become many."" Without consciousness, there is no question of by-products. (Pause) Now they are supplying water to these green trees. Why they do not supply to that wood, and get it green?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara: :'Cause from experience they know that it is not going to grow.,Prabhupāda,"That means nonsense, that there is something else. Because the same tree, now it is growing, watering, but when it will be dead, you pour water... The medicine is the same. Why it is not doing now, and why it was doing formerly? Then what is the thing that is lacking in it?"
Brahmānanda,":Similarly, if there's a dead body and they just add some chemicals, that doesn't necessarily mean it will come alive again.",Prabhupāda,":No. No. Chemicals are already there. If you say that the chemical is the cause of life, that chemicals are there. Because other lifes are coming. How do you say the chemical is wanting."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The life, the life energy, the heart...",Prabhupāda,":No, no. Life energy, what is the cause of that life energy? Chemicals."
Brahmānanda,:Chemicals remain.,Prabhupāda,":Yes. So that chemical is already there. Life energy is there. Because from the body, thousands of microbes are coming out. They're living entities. So you cannot say that the life energy is lacking there. No, it is already there. How can you say that life energy not there? Otherwise, how other life is coming. Not only one, thousands. So how do you say the life energy's lacking there? What do you think, KarandharaPrabhu?"
Karandhara: :,Karandhara: :Yes.,Prabhupāda,:The life energy's already there.
Karandhara: :,Karandhara: :Yes.,Prabhupāda,You cannot say the life energy's not there.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara: :But the life energy for the dead body...,Prabhupāda,":For the dead body means, that is a particular dead body. It is not the life energy. That is individuality. The life-energy—producing chemicals are already there. But that particular individual living entity has left. Just like I live in a room. So I leave this room. You cannot find me. But there are many other living entities there. There are ants, there are spider, there are so many. So that does not mean because I have left that room, it is lacking the accommodations. The accommodation is there. Other living entities are living there. I have left. I am individual. I have left. Therefore the individual soul is proved."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They do not know how that life energy comes or goes.,Prabhupāda,No. Life energy comes or... There is no question of coming and going.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Well coming into a body and leaving a body.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That means that is individual. That individual person is missing. He has left it.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Generally they conclude that it's an electro-chemical energy in the heart and that...,Prabhupāda,"Whatever it may be. That individual person has left. Other things are intact. Otherwise, how the living entities are coming out?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:They don't think that if it's simply a chemical, why cannot they just get a chemical that's a person.",Prabhupāda,"No. We refute that. The chemicals are already there. Otherwise how living entities are coming out? We don't say that chemical is missing. Because the same theory: conservation of energy. The chemicals, the energy-producing, that is already there. It may be in different form, but the life-producing-energy is there. Otherwise how the other living entities are coming out?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:In a living, in a living entity in the living body, there are so many things, personality...",Prabhupāda,"They have got personality, all the living entities coming out, the microbes. They have got their personality. If they're moving in this way, you stop. They'll move in this way."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:But in the dead body, there's no personality.",Prabhupāda,"That means that individual person has left. That is the proof, that is the proof of individual soul. Just like there are so many plants of the same species. One is dead. That individual plant is dead, but other species are living. It is not extinct. How can you say the species is extinct? How you can say? Darwin's forefather might be extinct. But the monkeys are there. What is the time?"
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Six thirty-five.,Prabhupāda,Hmm. We can walk little more.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So when you takeKṛṣṇaprasādam,the living entities which are within our body, they're also takingprasādam?",Prabhupāda,Yes. You are very benevolent. You takeKṛṣṇaprasādamfor others.
Brahmānanda,Welfare work.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That you can do without takingKṛṣṇaprasādam.Because you have got stool and urine within your body, and there are many germs. They're eating that. You need not make a separate endeavor to feed them. (pause) The individual soul is never lost. That is our philosophy.Dehino 'smin.He's simply changing different body under different circumstances. That's all. The soul, individual soul, is never lost. Neither he takes birth, neither he dies. He's simply changing the garments. This is perfect theory."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So when they think nicely, there's no reason why they don't accept it.",Prabhupāda,"But they are not nice men. They are rascals. They're not even gentlemen. A gentleman will have some shyness, some shame. But they're shameless. They cannot answer properly, still, shamelessly, they claim they're scientists."
Brahmānanda,They're expert bluffers.,Prabhupāda,"They're not even gentlemen. At least, I take them like that. They're talking that in the past, from matter, living force came, and when I ask them: ""Why don't you produce?"", ""Oh, that we shall do in the future."" Why? You have already experienced in the past, and you cannot do it, and you are leaving the matter for future. So they're shameless. Not even ordinary gentlemen. Shameless. That in talking all this nonsense. That is my charge. What do you think?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes. They're...,Prabhupāda,"Shameless. Shameless men. We cannot say even gentlemen. A gentleman will be shameful, ashamed to speak something nonsense."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They do not think.,Prabhupāda,That means they are not human being. A human being thinks twice before saying anything. Animals.
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:And all the innocent, they're all misled.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is, that is our protest. That you remain a rascal at home. Why you are misleading others?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They're spoiling themselves, but, not only that, they want to spoil others also.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is their business.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31].(pause)Kṛṣṇaso easily simplifies the matter. They'll not accept it.Dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā,tathādehāntara-prāptir...[Bg.2.13].In two lines, he solves the whole biological problems. In two lines. That is knowledge. Minimum words, maximum solution. That is knowledge. And talking nonsense and no meaning. Books, volumes of books, talking nonsense and there is no meaning. Is that knowledge?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That's ignorance.,Prabhupāda,Ignorance.
Brahmānanda,"Like the wolves, they bay: ""Ohhh, ooow.""",Prabhupāda,The frogs.
Brahmānanda,"The frogs, croaking, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Caca canh,caca canh,caca canh,caca canh,caca canh... That's all. They're thinking: ""Oh, we're talking very nicely."" The result is the snake, they find out here is a (unclear). Pop. Finish. So thiscaca canh, scientists, means when death comes, oh, everything's finished. That's all. All theircaca canh, scientific investigation, finished. And he becomes a dog, cat and something like that. That's all. Thereforemūḍhāḥ.They do not know that ""I have got this valuable life, human form of life, advanced intelligence. I'll have to take lesson fromKṛṣṇa, and make my life successful."" They do not know that.Caca canh,caca canh,caca canh,caca canh. And then die, and become again. When he dies, there is no question of science and talking nonsense. That is under the grip of nature. ""Yes, come on. Enter this body. Finished."" Just like the rascal rogue. He's very much proud of his strength. And the police comes arrest: ""Come on. Enter this custody. Finished."" It is like that."
Devotee:,"Devotee:We should go back, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. [Break] All these scientists, they discover so many things. Why they did not discover something that he would not die? He would not become old? Where is that discovery? They will say: ""Yes, in future."" One man is kicking on your face, and you are saying: ""Yes, in future, when I shall become strong, I shall kick him."" But you are, my dear sir, being kicked now. What you are doing now? ""Yes, I'm getting strength by your kicking."" So you all write very strongly, vehemently. Even it is little offensive, still these rascals should be taught good lesson. Yes. They're misleading. Godlessness. As soon as you say ""God created"", immediately they become arrogant. That is our protest. If they accept God, then we give them all credit. That's all right. Otherwise zero. We don't deprecate their intention of advancement in knowledge. But we simply protest against their defying the authority of God. That is our point."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:If they hearŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,then their hearts will be changed.",Prabhupāda,"Certainly. Yesterday, somebody has thanked to our students that: ""Oh, we are so obliged to you that you are supplyingBhāgavatam."" Is it not, somebody has said?"
Devotees:,Devotees:Yes yes. Tripurāri said that. Tripurāri.,Prabhupāda,Oh Tripurāri Yes. Somebody said like that?
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:Six volumes. They held theBhāgavatamsand said: ""Thank you very much."" And then they put them in their lockers and they were waiting for their plane and they each had the First Canto...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Any sincere man will feel obliged of our, this propaganda movement. ""By distributing these books, you are doing a great service toKṛṣṇa."" He wanted to say everyone:sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].He comes, therefore. So anyone who is doing the same service, that: ""Surrender toKṛṣṇa,"" he is recognized byKṛṣṇavery nicely. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā:nacatasmānmanuṣyeṣu[Bg.18.69].In the human society, nobody is dearer than him who is helping preaching work.HareKṛṣṇa."
Brahmānanda,"We are simply your puppets, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You're giving us the books.",Prabhupāda,"No. We are all set of puppets ofKṛṣṇa. I am also puppet. Puppet. This is disciplic succession. We, we have to become puppet. That's all. As I am puppet of myGuruMahārāja, if you become my puppet, then that is success. Our success is there when we become puppet of the predecessor.Tāṅderacaraṇasevibhaktasanevāsa.To live in the society of devotees and to become puppet of the predecessorācārya.This is success. So we are trying to do that.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness society and serve the predecessor. That's all.Harernāmaharernāma...[Cc. Ādi17.21].(pause) People will come. People will appreciate our propaganda. It will take some time."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They are appreciating more now than a couple of years ago.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They're starting to understand the genuine philosophy. (pause) All glories to you Śrīla Prabhupāda. Like someprasādam?,Prabhupāda,Yes. Now you distribute to all.
Devotees:,Devotees:All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end of recording),Prabhupāda,Does it mean the sand is begetting the insects?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:No.,Prabhupāda,"So their conclusion is like that. Because they see that the insects are coming from the sand. So from matter, this life is coming. This is their logic. It is called in Sanskrit:taṇḍula-vṛścika-nyāya.Everything is discussed.Taṇḍula-vṛścika-nyāya.You knowtaṇḍula-vṛścika-nyāya?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:No.,Prabhupāda,Taṇḍulameans rice.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Rice?,Prabhupāda,"Rice. Andvṛścikameans scorpion. The scorpions enter within the heaps of rice and lay their eggs. And by heat of the rice, they, another babyvṛścikacome out. And when they're coming out of the, thattaṇḍula,rice, the rascals are thinking that the rice is begetting thevṛścika.They do not know the inner secrecy that anothervṛścika,scorpion, has laid down the eggs within the rice, and by the fermentation of the heat of the rice, the eggs are fructified and the living entities coming out.Taṇḍula-vṛścika-nyāya.(pause)"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So many birds...,Prabhupāda,"They have got their food. Everyone is intelligent enough where to find out food, where to lie down.Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya.How to have sex. Everyone is intelligent. Even a small insect, the flies. I see, at night, they have sex. One fly after another. Everyone knows it."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That's the inborn quality of the living entities.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁcasāmānyametatpaśubhirnarāṇām.The only special significance of human being is that he has got special intelligence to understand what is Absolute Truth.Athātobrahmajijñāsā.So therefore his first duty is to know the Absolute Truth. Not waste time for eating, sleeping, mating. The modern material civilization is wasting time, so-called advancement of material comforts. Simply wasting time.Nidrayāhriyatenaktaṁvyavāyenacavāvayaḥ[SB2.1.3].They are wasting time at night either by sleeping or by sexual intercourse.Divācārthehayārājankuṭumba-bharaṇenavā.And during daytime, simply: ""Where is money? Where is money? Where is money?"" And as soon as they get money, they spend it forkuṭumba-bharaṇa,for maintaining the family. This is their business. The sum total of modern civilization. And if they can purchase a nice car, that is the success of their life.Kuṭumba-bharaṇenavā.Not only for himself, for his wife, for his children, if he has got three cars. Just like ourMukundaMahārājais doing. He's earning one thousand dollars and spending in car. That is hisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Rascal boy is so much captivated with the rascal girl. He's thinking that he's happy. He's spoiling his life. (pause)Divācārthehayārājankuṭumba-bharaṇenavā[SB2.1.3].

But still he thinks that ""They'll save me."" Just like when you, in the aeroplane, there may be thousands of aeroplanes, others, but when your aeroplane is in danger, nobody can save you. You have to save yourself, Otherwise, you go to hell. Similarly, we have to save ourself individually byKṛṣṇaconsciousness. What this material advancement will save me? Will the material advancement of knowledge can save anyone from death? Is it possible? Real problem,duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam,real problem is birth, death, old age and disease. So what this material advancement of science will help in this connection? They'll bluff: ""Yes, in the future, we shall do."" That's all. Bluffing. Past, present, future, never they'll be able to help. Still they're proud. ""Yes, in the future, we shall do it.""Dehāpatya kalatrādiṣu.

Can they fly like the birds are flying, all together? There is no collision. They can go with full force. There is no collision. They haven't got even intelligence like the birds. And they're proud. If a small bird, they'll fly together, flock together, with great force, they'll not collapse. Can the scientists arrange flying like that. Immediately, they'll be all smashed. Still, they're proud of intelligence. What intelligence you have got? You are less intelligent than the birds."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:The ants also can walk.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:The ants, thousands of them without colliding. But the cars, they're always colliding.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The living entities, when the soul is inside a body, they're much more flexible than the, the aeroplanes or cars that are made by the scientists?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. The aeroplane wings, they're fixed up. But the bird wings, he can do like this. Even they can do like that, where is the credit? It is already there. Many millions and thousands. (pause)"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:In physical sciences, there's a branch called thermodynamics that deals with the transfer of heat and energy in different forms. So their three laws is called first law, second law and the third law. First law deals with the conservation of energy in different forms. And the second law, it is stated that the energy of the universe is constant. Just like the, in theŚrī Īśopaniṣad,the Invocation,pūrṇa...",Prabhupāda,"Yes.Pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate,pūrṇasyapūrṇamādāyapūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate[IsoInvocation]."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:On the other hand the second law says that the, the entropy, that means the randomness of the all natural, spontaneously occurring natural processes, always increase. The randomness...",Prabhupāda,"But... Thing is that they are studying the laws very nicely. That's good. But they should appreciate that who has made this law? That is their defect. They are studying how the laws of nature is working. That's nice. But they should appreciate at the same time: Who made such subtle laws that they are working so nicely? That is our philosophy. We do not only study the laws and appreciate it, but we study the law-maker also. That is the difference between ourself and the so-called scientists. They are left, poor fund of knowledge. They cannot appreciate that there is a law-maker of these subtle laws. That is their defect. That is called poor fund of knowledge. And as soon as we accept law-maker, we have to accept that He's a person, He has got brain. Therefore He can make laws. Just like the great ocean is working, but there is a law. It cannot come here. Although there is potency. At any second it can cover the whole city But there is a law. Just like state laws. Up to this. No more admission. You have to stop. Similarly, there is law of God. Where there is order: You mighty ocean, you cannot come beyond this. This is law. There is sun. ""You must rise at half-past, at five o'clock in the morning."" ""Yes, sir."" This is law. ""You must rise on the Eastern side."" ""Yes, Sir."" Not whimsically. Sometimes this side, sometimes that side, sometimes that side. Cannot do whimsically. That is law of nature. And behind the law of nature, there is the order-giver, law-maker. This is perfect knowledge.mayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsūyatesa-carācaram[Bg.9.10].""Under My superintendence, the laws of nature is working."" This is intelligence. We are teaching people this intelligence. That's all. We don't decry that your studying of the laws of nature is useless. We don't say that. We say: ""Not so much. This is imperfect. Go forward still."" And that is perfection. You are a science student. By your scientific knowledge, you prove that behind these laws, there isKṛṣṇa. Then your scientific knowledge is perfect. Either from the chemical department or physical department or electrical department. Any department. It doesn't matter. Through that department you go to the ultimate center. Just like here is center. And there are so many spokes. So many spokes. So whichever spoke you may be, come to the center. That is your perfection. The spokes may be of different direction. Like that. But center isKṛṣṇa. The energy, central energy isKṛṣṇa.Ataḥpumbhirdvija-śreṣṭhāvarṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ,svanuṣṭhitasyadharmasyasaṁsiddhirhari-toṣaṇam[SB1.2.13].And these, these living entities, they're flying. They have got intelligence. ""The men are coming. We shall be smashed."" They're flying, taking shelter. Defence. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-mai...Defence, defence measures. They know how to defend themselves in their own way. Similarly they know how to eat and similarly they know how to sleep. But what is the difference between this insect and me? I can talk of God, I can understand God. It cannot. That is the difference. I can study Vedic literature, so many facilities for me. But all these facilities, all this intelligence, I am utilizing for the same purpose, eating, sleeping, sex and defence. Therefore it is useless waste of time, waste of life, valuable life. What is their benefit? Suppose you are studying that this law is working like that, this law is working like that, but you cannot help. You cannot change the law. You are under the laws. So what is the benefit simply by studying?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They get some pleasure.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Just knowing the law.,Prabhupāda,"That, that is sense gratification. That is sense gratification.Teṣāṁkleśo vaśiṣyate.For that sense gratification, he's working so hard, spending so much money, but the result is that, taking labor is their business. That's all. No benefit, no other benefit.Teṣāṁkleśaevavaśiṣyate. Nānyat,yathāsthūlatuṣa-khaṇḍana.(?) Just like you have taken the rice from the paddy. So now it is only skin. And if you try to employ that machine, Deki(?), what is called?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Deki(?) What you'll gain?,Prabhupāda,"Deki, yes. Simply dagdadagdadag dak. (sound imitation) But the rice is already taken away. So their labor is being spoiled in that way. They, pleasure... For the pleasure's sake, they are spoiling the human facilities. This is their intelligence. Therefore Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says:jaḍa-vidyājatomāyāravaibhavatomārabhajanebādhā, anityasaṁsāremohajanamiyā jībakekarayegādhā.Thisjaḍa-vidyā,this material science, is simply a hindrance to our progress of spiritual life. All these rascal scientists, they'll deny God. That is their business. Just like you said yesterday that somebody was accepting God, and the other scientists, they thought: ""No, it is insult."" So already they are in oblivion. They cannot understand what is God. And these rascals are making them more and more rascals. ""There is no God."" By their scientific research, the rascals are becoming more rascals. And they're becoming captivated: ""This is pleasure."" What pleasure you will do you with. Therefore they are, they aregādhā.They aregādhāand they are creatinggādhās.That is the song of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura.Jaḍa-vidyājatomāyāra...It is expansion ofmāyā'sillusory energy. The so-called scientific advancement is simply expanding the influence ofmāyā'sillusory energy. They're already rascals and fools, and still they are being made rascals and fools. So they're forgetting their real purpose of life and the whole human life is spoiled. This is the result of so-called scientific advancement."
Brahmānanda,Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura also says that the modern education makes men just like an ass.,Prabhupāda,"That is, I am explaining. (pause) Just like this, what is called, anthropology?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Astrology?,Prabhupāda,Darwin's...?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Dar, Darwin? Oh, naturalists.",Prabhupāda,"No, No. There are..."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, archaeologists?",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Anthropology. There's a department..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Anthropologists study with the skulls and...,Prabhupāda,"Oh, oh. This is..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Anthropology. It is a false theory, and upon this so many universities are spending money, professors. Thousands. Rascal theory. You see. In this way, they're wasting money.Śramaevahikevalam[SB1.2.8].Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ[SB10.2.32]."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They always have to revise their theories because about every few years they find something new which contradicts everything they have said before.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That is their intelligence.
Brahmānanda,And they think that's progress.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Progress in one sense. Because they're rascals, making little progress."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Advancing in the wrong direction.,Prabhupāda,"But the real progress is that when they will understand that: ""We are rascals."" That will be real progress, when they come to understand that: ""We are all fools and rascals."" That will be real progress. Just likeCaitanyaMahāprabhupresented Himself that: ""MyGuruMahārājafound me a rascal number one. Yes."" That is real progress."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Science is nearing that stage. Science...,Prabhupāda,"Because they're going to accept that they're all rascals? That will be the real progress.Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁprapadyate[Bg.7.19].After many, many births of rascaldom, when he comes toKṛṣṇaand surrenders. Yes.Vāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19].He is everything. That is real knowledge. (pause)"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:A group of scientists are now working on the idea that before we start anything, one should think...",Prabhupāda,"No, there is the latest theory. What is this, theory of ignorance? Or what is that? Theory of impossibility, or something like that?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Oh, theory of uncertainty?",Prabhupāda,"Uncertainty, yes. Theory of uncertainty. Everything is uncertain. And that is little intelligence. That, how to find out the certainty. (pause)"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The scientists, they claim that the discoveries are accidental and incidental, by accident, by chance.",Prabhupāda,What is this? That means they're fools.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:In many instances, when they try to find out something, they do not find the real one that they want, but in between, along the way, they find something else. So that is why they call it by accident. Because they did not aim for that, but somehow they get it along the way. (pause) [break]",Prabhupāda,"...also know how to keeppacewith the big, big waves. They know how to do it. They're not afraid of big waves."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They know that the wave is coming. They run because they know that the wave is coming.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And they know how to go forward and come back. Who has taught them this discipline?Kṛṣṇais there, within.Sarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭhomattaḥsmṛtirjñānamapohanaṁca[Bg.15.15].Kṛṣṇais dictating: ""Now you go forward. Now you come back. Here is your food."" He's giving intelligence.Sarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭhomattaḥsmṛtirjñānamapohanaṁca[Bg.15.15].He's giving direction in every living entity, but when a human being, He gives direction, if he surrenders, that: ""Go this way. You'll come to Me.""Dadāmibuddhi-yogaṁtaṁyenamāmupayāntite.And that is human intelligence. So far these lower animals are concerned, they are given, being given intelligence how to eat, how to sleep, how tomate, how to defend. But a human being, if he engages himself in the service of the Lord, then Lord will give intelligence how to come back to home, back to Godhead. This is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.That is the condition.Teṣāṁsatata-yuktānāṁbhajatāṁprīti-pūrvakam[Bg.10.10].""Only to those who are engaged in devotional service with love and faith, I give him intelligence how to come back to home, back to Godhead."" Therefore, after coming to human form of body, we must awaken our intelligence about understanding the Supreme Lord. And if we take up the process sincerely, with love, then Lord within will give you dictation: ""You come this way, come this way, come this way."" Otherwise, not. The first condition is:teṣāṁsatata-yuktānām.Therefore we are trying to engage all our disciples to be engaged twenty-four hours in devotional service. Then his life will be successful. That is ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement.Satata.Satatameans always, constantly. Just like we are walking, but we are engaged inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Others are walking. They're wasting time. But we are, we are walking, but, at the same time, we are engaged inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We are eating. We are engaged inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We are sleeping. We are engaged inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We are working... Always. ThenKṛṣṇawill see: ""Now he's serious. Let him have some intelligence, how he can come back to home."" This is the process. And the pleasure of sense gratification, oh, that is also known how to do it by the hogs and dogs. They know. The hogs are eating everything, up to stool, for sense gratification. So the human being, if they have no discrimination, they can eat anything and everything for sense grati..., they are no better than hogs. What is the difference between hog and human being? The hog has no discrimination of eating. Anything it will eat, up to stool. So if a human being becomes like hog, without any discrimination, he will eat anything, that is advancement of civilization? Advancement of becoming hog. That's all. And they like, actually. The hippies, they like hogs."
Brahmānanda,They worship them.,Prabhupāda,"Worship. That is their advancement of... After taking so much university education, they have learned how to love hogs. Just see the fun. (pause) They are living within the sand. How these rascals are speaking that because in the moon planet there is sand only there is no living entity. How we can believe? We see practically. They do not go to the garden. They live within the sand. How they are living? (pause—break) ...and they do some acrobatic feats, like that. Still they're in no condition."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They're smart.,Prabhupāda,"So that smartness you haven't got. Even of a small bird. And still you are proud of advancement. The vulture goes up and he can see everything but when you go up, aeroplane, up you cannot see where is your home. Is it not? They can find out, four miles, five miles away, where is a corpse. Immediately they flock. (pause) What is this building? Some..."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:An auditorium. We're going to have a festival here on, next month.",Prabhupāda,Oh. That's nice. What do they charge?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Well, if you don't charge anything, they don't charge you anything for using it.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, they don't charge?"
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:No. If you don't charge people for coming to the function, they don't charge you for using this place.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, that's nice."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:It's owned by the city.,Prabhupāda,"This is good. We can hold meetings, distributeprasādam.(pause) They have discovered computer machine...?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,And put some sand in it. Let it count. Not very much. A handful of sand and put in. The machine will stop. The result will be the machine will be no more working.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Computer will reject.,Prabhupāda,Eh.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Computer will reject, saying that: ""I cannot do it.""",Prabhupāda,They reject?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes. Something which is not possible...,Prabhupāda,"Then, then it is imperfect. If he cannot count, reject, then it is imperfect.HareRāmaHareRāma..."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They would estimate.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They would estimate.,Prabhupāda,"What is that, estimating. Estimate how many...?"
Karandhara:,Karandhara:They cannot count perfectly. So they estimate.,Prabhupāda,"Rough idea. (pause) So on the sea side, it is more pleasant than in the park. Is it not? Brace air. (pause) This is bike route? Bicycle route?"
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Yes. (pause),Prabhupāda,The car looks like governor's car.

Brahmānanda,By a dial?,Prabhupāda,"No, by electricity."
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Yes. It has a dial on it. You turn the dial and it tells you the time in different places... (pause),Prabhupāda,"InVṛndāvana, there is a place called Nidhuvana."
Devotee:,Devotee:Nidhuvana?,Prabhupāda,"Nidhuvana. So that was a place... Still people go to visit. So oneBhagavāndāsaBābājī, he was chanting, and in the middle of his chanting he made (makes sound with hands like clapping) like this. So his disciples... (pause) Yes. His disciples asked him: ""Sir, why did you (makes clapping sound) do like this?"" ""So there was a goat entered Nidhuvana. So I drove it away."" So where is that machine by which you can see...? It is not the time, but see the activities of everywhere? But that is possible. Yes."
Brahmānanda,"Oh, even though he did not see the goat, he knew it was there.",Prabhupāda,"No, he's seeing. Otherwise, how does he (makes sound) ""Hut, hut, hut."" He's seeing. Where is that machine? So this Darwin's theory says that there was no intelligent man or brain but how these books were written, thousands and thousands of years ago? These Vedicśāstras.If there were no intelligent brain? Vyāsadeva, like Vyāsadeva. Before Vyāsadeva also, other great sages, they compiled..."
Brahmānanda,They have no explanation.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Brahmānanda,"They have no explanation for the author who, of the Vedic literatures. They say: ""unknown forest sages.""",Prabhupāda,"Unknown, it may be unknown, but the things are there. Where from they got the brain? That is our question. It may be unknown to you, or unknown to me, but the brain work is there. The philosophy is there, and the... At least, the language, the poetic arrangement, the linguistic strength, everything is there. So you may not know the person, but you can understand the brain. Just like..."
Brahmānanda,"They think our brain is increasing, but actually we see it decreasing. Because we cannot duplicate that...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Not only duplicate. You cannot even understand properly. Do you... To understand the Vedic philosophy, you have to tax your brain. Just likeBhagavad-gītā.Take, forBhagavad-gītā.It is accepted as a great book of philosophy all over the world. And... Now wherefrom this brain came out. Apart from acceptingKṛṣṇaas God, take it, the language, take the language, the philosophy, the thoughts. How great they are. Now how can you say that people had no higher brain. Within hundred years everything has grown up. All these rascals. What is the Darwin's age?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Darwin says the, he says in his history of the origin, he cannot trace completely.",Prabhupāda,"Whatever he has traced, what is the history of that tracing history? Tracing age?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So he started that life started from very primitive, different primitive forms...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. What is the time of Darwin. Which year he was a professor?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The theory started in 1859, about...",Prabhupāda,"1859. So hundred years ago. So all the brains developed within hundred years. All these rascals came out within hundred years. And before that, there was no other rascal. Just see the fun. All the scientific improvement, anthropology, everything came within hundred or two hundred years."
Brahmānanda,Yeah.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Brahmānanda,Yes. That is their idea.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Before that, there were no brain."
Brahmānanda,'Cause they didn't understand his theory.,Prabhupāda,Just see.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Because before that, they're thinking that there's no intelligent person...",Prabhupāda,"That, that, I am pointing out, that all intelligent persons, during the British Empire, they came out. The whole aim was to defy the Indian civilization."
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:They call it the ""Age of Enlightenment.""",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:After the fifteenth century, they call it the ""Age of Enlightenment.""",Prabhupāda,"So the Britishers, they wanted to rule over India, and they were advertising, at least in India, that: ""We are making you civilized. Before British rule, the Indians were rude, primitive natives."" That's all. That is their propaganda. The whole propaganda was to make the Indians known that: ""We are giving you life and civilization. Before this, you were not even human beings."" That is their propaganda. So they accept this literature, but they date within one thousand years, one thousand-five hundred years. Even this rascal, Dr. Radhakrishnan, he datesBhagavad-gītāwithin two thousand years. That's all. Perhaps I am the first person making propaganda thatBhagavad-gītāwas spoken five thousand years ago. I am the first person. All other so-called scholars, they have dated within two thousand years. (pause) There was a book: ""England's work in India,"" written by one rascal Indian, M. Ghosh. In that book... That was taught in the schools in our days. The theme of the book is that before British rule, India was not at all advanced in any way. The incidence ofsatī...Satī.That was very elaborately explained.Satī..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Satīdharma?,Prabhupāda,"Satīdharma.Yes. Formerly, even Arjuna's stepmother, Mādrī, he also, she also died with her husband. That was the system. The wife voluntarily used to die along with the husband."
Brahmānanda,Gāndhārī.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Brahmānanda,"Gāndhārī, wife ofDhṛtarāṣṭra.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So later on such devoted wife was lacking. So the system was, some cases, they were forced to die. So these things have been elaborately explained in the, that book, and Britishers stopped it. So the Indians were uncivilized. Britishers made them civilized. Everything was misinterpreted. Yes."
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But they do not know the inner meaning...,Prabhupāda,"No, inner meaning is there. But they would not explain that. Simply the dark side, they would explain. And prove that the Indian civilization was very crude and primitive. It has no enlightenment. That was British propaganda. Even during national movement, they bribed one American woman, and she wrote a book: ""Mother India."" Do you know that?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:No, I, no...",Prabhupāda,"Ah. ""Mother India."" She described all the blackmailing of Indian social activities, andGandhiremarked it: ""Drain Inspector's report."""
Brahmānanda,What?,Prabhupāda,"""Drain inspector's report."""
Brahmānanda,Drain?,Prabhupāda,"Drain, that sewage water..."
Brahmānanda,The sewer.,Prabhupāda,Sewage water.
Brahmānanda,That's what she inspected.,Prabhupāda,"She's a drain inspection report. And in reply to that, one Punjabi barrister, he wrote one book: ""Uncle Sam"". He pointed out all the blackmailing of American government. So these things are going on.Doṣamicchantipāmarāḥ.Those who are low class of men, they simply try to find out the faults.Guṇaicchantisaj-janāḥ.And those who are enlightened, they will take the qualities only.Saj-janāguṇaicchanti,doṣamicchantipāmarāḥ,muktibrāhmaṇāicchantimadhumicchantibhramarāḥ.Yes. That, there are flies, ordinary flies. They are searching after sores, where is sore in your body. And there are bumblebees, they are searching after where is honey. Similarly, those who are rascals, they'll find out: ""Oh, here is a fault. Here is a fault.""HareKṛṣṇa.HareKṛṣṇa."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So this is a demoniac quality.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. These Britishers should have tried to assimilate the mass Indian culture with their help, administrative help, to broadcast this culture. No. They wanted to exploit India, and prove that ""our ruling over India""... Because they have to show something to the outside world..."
Brahmānanda,To justify that exploitation.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. (pause) They would not allow anyone to enter India to make trade. And that is the cause of two big world wars. This is a... Real cause is India. Because the Germans, they were very intelligent. They were intelligent nation. They wanted to trade with India. So Britishers will not allow them. Actually, Britishers were selling goods, purchasing from Germany andJapan, And when German would go to trade, they will enhance the custom duty very, very large amount. So that was the grudge of the German nation. Two times, they fought with that ""Finish these Britishers-shop-keeper's nation."" Yes. Hitler, Hitler was... Hitler or the Emperor Wilhelm, some of them, one of them, was calling the Britishers: ""shop-keeper's nation."""
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Shop-keeper's nail?,Prabhupāda,Shop-keeper's nation.
Brahmānanda,A nation of shop-keepers only.,Prabhupāda,"That's right. Why the shop-keeper's nation should predominate all over the world? Kill them. That is their (indistinct). And actually it is the German people who killed Britishers, British lion. Apart, after the Second War..."
Brahmānanda,British was finished.,Prabhupāda,"Finished. Everyone in the United Nations pressed on them: ""Why you are colonizing? Why you are occupying so much land? You give up."" They were obliged. And there was great national movement ofGandhi. So all United Nations pressed that: ""They're wanting to avoid you. Why you are, by force, staying there?"" Still, they would not go. But when the soldiers began to join the national movement, they gave it up. ""Now we cannot rule it."" How very nasty! For their political power, they did so many heinous activities in India. That's a great history. For selling their cotton goods, India's weavers were cut this finger so that they cannot weave. This is there in the history."
Brahmānanda,"The, the independence movement of Africa, they took great inspiration from Gandhi's movement.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Brahmānanda,"IfGandhidid it, then, they say: ""Oh, now we can do it.""",Prabhupāda,Gandhistarted the movement from Africa. South Africa.
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Gandhiwas attempted to be killed in South Africa. Oh yes. One time he was crossing the street and the man beaten him so severely. He could have died. One Englishman saved him. He was attempted to be killed. After this incidence, whenGandhireturned to India, he became leader automatically. (pause) When Dr.Kalidasa-nama..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Kalidasa?,Prabhupāda,Dr.Kalidasa-nama. Did you hear his name?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Only just now.,Prabhupāda,"He was our professor. So he was explaining the different ages of archaeologist, anthropology."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:This is in philosophy, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,"No, history."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, history.",Prabhupāda,"In my honors class, I had history. He was teaching us history."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:What is the standard of Calcutta University, Śrīla Prabhupāda, at the time when Śrīla Prabhupāda was in the University? How was the...",Prabhupāda,"Oh, it was nice. Very nice students were coming out."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:The moral standard was very good?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. We respected our professors like our fathers. The relationship between the student and the professors was very good. I had one Scottish professor, Dr. W.S. Urquhart. He was my nice friend. He was professor of philosophy, psychology. Later on he became vice-chancellor."
Brahmānanda,Calcutta?,Prabhupāda,"Calcutta, yes. A very perfect gentleman. Kind-hearted. Sometimes we joked. We were taking this, what is called, peanuts. So the professor was passing. So some of our friends remarked: (Bengali) So he thought that professor did not know Bengali. So immediately he turned: (Bengali). So we became very much ashamed. Yes. So all the professors from foreign countries, they were instructed to learn Bengali language, local language. That was the system. All officers, big officers, educate... (Aside) Good morning. ...big educationists, they were to learn the local language. And they used to learn Bengali. Especially in Calcutta. There was one professor, Mr. Scrimgeour. He was professor of literature, English literature. So while teaching one English literature, he was giving parallel passage from BankimCandraChatterjee. Yes. ""Your Bankimbabusays like this."" He used to say like that."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda,"That means he studied Bankim literature. BankimCandraChatterjee was compared with Sir Walter Scott, of English literary men. Sir Walter Scott. In those days, Charles Dickens."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Charles Dickens?,Prabhupāda,Yes. And Sir Walter Scott were known two very great English literary men.
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Novelists.,Prabhupāda,"After sixth year... Yes novelists. So the relationship was very nice. There were... Otherwise, how the Britishers could rule, unless there was obedience. But as soon as they saw now the obedience is going on, the soldiers are leaving our camp and joining the national camp,"" immediately they decided to leave peacefully. Otherwise, there would be some revolution. At that time, all good relationship will go. Better separate with good relation. This was Attlee's policy, to convince statesmen like Churchill that: ""You cannot rule over India any more. Better separate in good relationship."""
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:A few weeks ago, there was a supplement in the Times, the London Times. So they were describing about the very relationship between British and India, in the early British period and after the British period. There they talked only about very good points, whereas they never say anything about... All good points.",Prabhupāda,"No, that... When they discuss, they must describe the good points only. But some of the British rulers were very, very unkind. And the last was that Jallianwalla Bagh massacre, created by Lord Chelmsford. Then the British rule finished. In 1917, and immediatelyGandhistarted non-cooperation movement. So after thirty years, the Britishers were obliged to leave."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:The Scottish Church College in Calcutta...,Prabhupāda,Yes. I was student there.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, Śrīla Prabhupāda was in Scottish Church?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:It's very popular among the...,Prabhupāda,"Oh, Yes. In Calcutta, there are two colleges, Presidency College and Scottish Churches College. All respectable families, son will go there, Scottish Churches College, Presidency College."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They started almost at the same time?,Prabhupāda,"No, no. It is very old. Presidency College is government, and Scottish Churches College, by the Scottish Church missionaries. There was one priest, Duff, his name was Duff. He started in Srirampur, a small educational institute, Duff Institute. He was a Scotsman. Later on, all the Scottish missionaries combined together and they started this Scottish Churches College."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Still now the schools are respected now.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Still now they have good names,...",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Yes, yes."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Presidency College and Scottish Church College.,Prabhupāda,Now they are ruined due to this Naxalite movement. Subash Bose was in our college.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Oh, Scottish? Oh.",Prabhupāda,"He was first in the Presidency College, but on account of his national spirit, he was rusticated from Presidency College. Then he came to our college."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:There is a...,Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:...Subash Bose Research Institute in Calcutta in...,Prabhupāda,Subash Bose?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes. About the museum.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:In Hazrat, Hazrat road it is in...near, not far from...?",Prabhupāda,Mahajati?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes,maha...",Prabhupāda,MahajatiSadhana.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, MahajatiSadhana.",Prabhupāda,That is in Central Calcutta.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:There are many foreign scholars from, they're mostly fromJapan, and many...",Prabhupāda,I don't find. I do not know much about it.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:When I was in Calcutta, I used to go there quite regularly. Because I was studying German. They have got German classes better in that institute.",Prabhupāda,This is the food for the fish?
Karandhara:,"Karandhara:Yes, bait.",Prabhupāda,Horse dung?
Karandhara:,Karandhara:Clams.,Prabhupāda,"What is that, clam?"
Brahmānanda,Shellfish.,Prabhupāda,Oh. (pause) So many...
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:There are so many flies.,Prabhupāda,"They are not flies. They're insect of the sand. They live within the sand. The scientists will say: ""You see? The living entities coming out of sand, from matter."""
Brahmānanda,"Automatically, they say.",Prabhupāda,"But why don't you create from sand? Flying like that. You are so advanced. Take some grains of sand and create another fly. They cannot create even an ant, and still they say that life is coming out from matter. And in future we shall create. In future, what is your credit? It is already there. If your science is perfect, that life is coming out of matter, now prove it by laboratory experiment. Take some sand and create some life. (pause)"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they're concluding, the scientists, that without having the real knowledge of their investigation. Because they are concluding that life started from matter, but there's no proof.",Prabhupāda,"No proof. How they can say so? (pause) If they accept that life started from life, then they'll have to accept God, the Supreme Person. Just like by practical experience we see one life is produced by another life. The father, mother begets a child. Not that a child drops from the sky. Their test tube experiment also depends on the father and mother. So what is that? Where is the proof? In the test tube you mix some chemical and produce a child. Then your theory is all right. You cannot create even an ant, even a fly. And still you are claiming that you can manufacture human being?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:What they'll say manufacture means they will take a seed, that... But",Prabhupāda,"But that means that is not... Originally, it is from life. Seed is from the life. So where is your proof that matter produces life? Then you have to accept: life produces life. According to ourśāstra,within the semina of the father, the living body, living entity, takes shelter. And it is injected to the mother's womb and the two matters mixes and the body forms. This is our śāstric explanation. Not that the semina discharged by the father, that is life. No. Within that semina, the living entity takes shelter. And it is put into favorable condition. Then it develops the body. This is... We, we find inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.That putting of the living entity in a particular type of semina depends on higher authorities. The higher authorities will judge what kind of body this living entity, after leaving this body, will get. So by higher authority it will be directed to enter into the semina of such father, and it will be injected into the womb of the mother. Then you'll get, develop a particular type of body and come out and suffer or enjoy. This is the process."
Brahmānanda,"If that semina is misused or wasted, then that disrupts the plan of the authorities.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,It's a serious matter.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore this contraceptive method is sinful activity. Abortion, contraceptive method. This is against the, I mean to say, plan of the Supreme. Just like the government is making some plan, and if you spoil it, you are criminal. What is the time now?"
Brahmānanda,Twenty of seven. Twenty minutes of seven.,Prabhupāda,So we can return now. Which way? (pause)
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So their statement that life started from matter can be disproved very easily?,Prabhupāda,"Oh yes. Any child can disprove it. And that theory is also wrong that lower type of animals were first created. No. All different varieties were, all were existing."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Prabhupāda explains that in, inBhagavad-gītā,in one of the purports.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Whatever desire the living entities had before the annihilation, that became the, the living entities enter into different bodies according to their...",Prabhupāda,Desire.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:...desire.,Prabhupāda,"He wanted a certain type of life. So nature gives him. ""All right, take this body."" He desires in a certain way, means he's associating with the quality of nature in a method, and according to that association, he's getting a particular type of body. Mind, mind is the creative force. Thinking. Thinking, feeling, willing. These are the psychological functions. So, first of all, thinking. Then he develops to work. And it is work you get a particular type of situation. [Break] One enters into the body of a pig. Then he'll have to go under the evolutionary process. Just like if you, if you are on the topmost staircase. Somehow or other you fall down. Then again you have to go, step by step. This is the... The steps are always there. Not that the steps are created for you. No. The steps are already there."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Śrīla Prabhupāda, it is dirty.",Prabhupāda,"It is loose. On account of hastiness, I could not properly set up."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Some birds, Śrīla Prabhupāda, like theminaḥ...?",Prabhupāda,"Minaḥ, yes."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They can be taught to say something. So if they are taught to chantHareKṛṣṇa...,",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:...then are this, this is a good service?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Little service. By hearingHareKṛṣṇamantra,he'll be elevated."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But the bird doesn't know that he's chanting...,Prabhupāda,"No, he doesn't know."
Brahmānanda,"CaitanyaMahāprabhu, He could teach animals the chanting of the names of...",Prabhupāda,"Yes.CaitanyaMahāprabhucan do everything. He can deliver anyone without chanting. For Him, there is no condition. So this morning, I could not wash my face. So therefore, the cookies may be distributed to the devotees. I have not washed my face, you see.Harernāmaharernāma...[Cc. Ādi17.21].(end of recording)"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So they'll say, that, some scientists, that the science deals with the matter, or the physical matter, and so they try to...",Prabhupāda,"No physical matter, wherefrom the physical matter comes? Unless you come to that point, you are not a scientist. Wherefrom the matter comes?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Sometime, sometimes they try to relate science and the religion, some scientists, and they make a differentiation. They say religion...",Prabhupāda,"No, religion, when you come to the real cause of everything, then you come to religion. Religion is the science of sciences. Because you are trying to find out the original cause, and as soon you come to the original cause, He is God, original cause. So as soon as you come to God, then there is religion."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:And that, that definition of differentiation is that they say religion deals with the value of life, the moral and ethics... And on the other hand...",Prabhupāda,"Religion, religion is the source of moral and ethics. Because religion means to come to the perfectional point. So as soon as there is perfection, moral and ethics are already there. So called moral ethics, that is artificial.Harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāḥ.If one is not a devotee of the Lord, his morality has no value. That is artificial.Harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāḥ. Mahad-guṇāḥ,high qualities, moral, ethics, they are high qualities. SoBhāgavatasays that unless one is devotee of God, he cannot have high qualities. That is artificial."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So without God consciousness, there's no question of morality.",Prabhupāda,"No. There is no question of morality. First of all, define what is morality? What is the definition of morality?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:The value of life in its proper perspective.,Prabhupāda,"Value of life, everyone has got his own value of life. a drunkard, he has got his value of life. That ""When I drink, it is value."" Is that morality?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is the morality of the drunkard.,Prabhupāda,Therefore everyone has got his own morality. Then what is the standard morality?
Brahmānanda,Yeah. There must be a standard for everyone.,Prabhupāda,"That is Ramakrishna mission's morality:yatamatatatapatha.Whatever you think, that is your way.Yatamatatatapatha."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yatamatatatapatha.,Prabhupāda,"As many ways you think, that's all right."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is how they define morality.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That you make your own morality.
Brahmānanda,"That's not standard, though.",Prabhupāda,"No. These rascals do like that, so why don't you make your own law in the state?"
Brahmānanda,Cannot.,Prabhupāda,"Why do they not make their own law, that I have got my own law. I don't care for state law."" Will they be accepted?"
Brahmānanda,Anyone who does that is either criminal or insane.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, insane. All criminality is done when one is insane. That is the definition of theVedas.Everyone is criminal when he's insane. Sane man never commits any criminality. Just like when a, when a man commits murder, unless he becomes insane, he cannot commit murder."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:So among the college students, among the college students it's very common that they say: ""I don't care what is said."" These people, students.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, but..."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:I want to, I want to follow my own aim and desire, my own morality. They say like that.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right, but why don't you do that in case of your relationship to the state. Suppose the state says: ""You must drive to the right."" Why don't you drive on the left? Why do you obey the state laws? What does he say? You do whatever you like."
Brahmānanda,That means there's someone more powerful than they are.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,They have to obey.,Prabhupāda,"Immediately he'll be kicked on his face. ""You rascal, why you driving. Kick on your...""(laughter) and what he'll say at that time? Can he say that: ""Yes, it is my law. I'll do this."" Can he say like this?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:He cannot say like this.,Prabhupāda,"Then, then what is this? It is insanity. What you cannot do, if you say: ""I can do it,"" Then it is insanity."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They just argue without any background.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Just for argument...,Prabhupāda,That means the so-called education making them all rascals and fools. That's all. The education has no value. We therefore say that you close all these universities. You are simply producing rascals and fools. That's all.
Brahmānanda,Asses.,Prabhupāda,"Asses,mūḍhāḥ.Unless one comes to the point ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, we don't give any value to so-called education, advancement of knowledge. We don't give any value. Our only formula isharāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāḥ.If one is notKṛṣṇaconscious, he has no value. Immediately reject him. He has no value of his life. We are advocatingKṛṣṇaconsciousness not on sentiment, on the value of life. That these men are being carried away by whims without any value of life. Let us save them. That is our mission. Just like a, a foolish person is going in, on the ocean. So it is: ""Oh, why you are going that way? Where you are going? You are a madman."" This is the duty."
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Similarly these rascals are going to hell and we are trying to save them. That's all. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:I read an article by Śrīla Prabhupāda about sometime in 1935 or 40, early in theBack to Godheadmagazine. In the earlier copies, the Prabhupāda writes about the standard of morality in one article.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes, yes."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:There everything is very nicely explained.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. I wrote one time, standard of morality. (pause) We have got very simple formulas from the statement ofśāstras. Harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāḥ.Hariis the Supreme Personality of Godhead,abhakta,nondevotee, a person who is not a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,kuto mahad-guṇāḥ,where is his high qualities? No, no high qualities. In theBhagavad-gītāalso:namāṁprapadyantemūḍhāḥ[Bg.7.15].So we see whether he has surrendered to God. Otherwise, he's amūḍhaḥ,rascal."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The first one is fromBhāgavatam,Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,That is fromBhagavad-gītā.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:No, the first one.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Brahmānanda,Harāvabhakta...,Prabhupāda,"Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavatyaki&#241canāsarvair guṇaistatrasamāsatesurāḥ, harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāmanorathena...Manorathena[SB5.18.12].These rascals, they are simply speculating on the mental platform. That's all.Manorathenāsati dhāvatobahiḥ[SB5.18.12].They are entrapped by the external energy, by mental speculation. They have no value. All these scientists, philosophers, they're on the mental platform, speculating. I am certi... I say this. You say: ""No, I say this."" You see. Who is correct?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:It doesn't matter.,Prabhupāda,"No, it doesn'tmat... Therefore they're all madmen. You can speak in your own way. I'll speak in my own way and another fool thinks that both of them are scientists. They do not agree. Still he's scientist. Just see. Cheaters and the cheated. Somebody's cheating and somebody's becoming cheated. The whole society's the combination of cheaters and cheated. That's all. I see both of them, they do not agree. Just like they have rejected religion because two religionists, they do not agree. So why not these rascal scientists? They do not agree. Just see. They are so fool. But still they are after that. Their modern people they have rejected religion because they say that one religionist does not agree with another religionist. So there is no... Skepticism. So why not about the scientists? Just see. Everywhere you will find contradiction. Therefore anyone... and we are find out this contradiction because we have little attachment forKṛṣṇa. Others cannot find out. We are challenging scientists, philosophers, although we are teeny person, because we have little attachment forKṛṣṇa. Otherwise, who is detecting their follies? Nobody. The scientist's follies, the philosopher follies, their contradiction... A devotee can find out.Paśyantijñāna-cakṣuṣā.Unless one is highly enlightened, one cannot find out these defects, contradiction.Paśyantijñāna-cakṣuṣā.We have got simple formulas in theśāstras.Simply on the basis of those formulas... Whole Vedic literature is like that. Just likeĀyurveda, Āyurvedaor astrology. Everything is like that.Āyurveda,the medicine. They have to learn only the beating of the pulse. If one becomes expert in which way the pulse beating is going on... They have got example. Just like some birds jump over like this. Some bird goes like this. So they have got example how the pulse is beating, jumping or easily going. So the symptoms, if one can study, he becomes physician, first-class. Immediately. Because as soon as he can study the pulse, how it is beating, in which way... That is, that requires little experience. Then immediately the formula is that if the pulse is beating in this way, then these symptoms will be there. And he will ask the patient..."
Brahmānanda,To confirm the symptoms.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Confirm the symptoms. If he says: ""Yes,"" then immediately diagnosis is there. And as soon as diagnosis is there, the medicine is there. Simple method. Similarly, astrologers, they will see the constellation of the stars, and then the formula is there. ""If this star is now with this star, if that planet is with that planet, then this is the result."" So this Āyurvedic astrologer and physician requires little clear brain. Otherwise, very nice. The research work is already there. Just like we are. What is our research?Kṛṣṇasays:parastasmāttubhāvaḥanyaḥ[Bg.8.20].""There is another nature."" We believe it. We have not gone to another nature. ButKṛṣṇasays: ""There is another nature, spiritual nature."" This is, this material nature, inferior nature,bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥ[Bg.7.4], apareyam,this is inferior.Apareyam itas tvanyāṁprakṛtiṁviddhimeparām[Bg.7.5].There is another superior nature. What is that? The living force. Who will argue? So we have got very easy method. And because we are receiving all this information from the most perfect, therefore our knowledge is perfect. That's all. And for all these rascals,śramaevahikevalam[SB1.2.8].Unnecessarily they're laboring. They cannot come to the right conclusion. Thereforeharāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāh.Oh, what is the good quality? If you unnecessarily work without any result, then what is your qualification?"
Brahmānanda,Mūḍha.,Prabhupāda,"Mūḍha,ass. The ass works without any profit. So these are asses. Without coming to the right conclusion, they're working hard, day and night, and spending lots of money. Somūḍhas.(pause) Why the scientists are searching out protons, neutrons? To find out the original cause. So they could not find the original cause. They see the middle work only, how the proton is working, neutron is working, atom is working. But wherefrom this arrangement came? How they are working systematically? They do not know. So what is their science?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:It is just like studying that shadow.,Prabhupāda,That's all.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:But we know that there is a shadow. So there must be a real object.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Unless there is real object, there cannot be shadow. Now the sky is clouded. We cannot see above the cloud. Does it mean there is nothing? If somebody: ""Oh, there is nothing (indistinct)"""
Brahmānanda,"All we have to do is fly up there, and it's bright as sun.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Somehow we have to remove the covering.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. (pause) We don't give any credit to any man if he's notKṛṣṇaconscious. That is our final conclusion. We can give credit so much, as you have got. Just like you are a driver. So I can give you the credit of a driver. But I cannot give you the credit of a high-court judge. So much, what you know, that much credit..."
Brahmānanda,Future.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. When in future you become high-court judge, then I shall give you credit. Why before you want to take credit?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So one has to have certain qualifications.,Prabhupāda,"Everyone has got. The bird has got also certain qualifications. What is this. You cannot jump over like that. Just see how it is doing, a small bird. He has got complete sense how to protect. He's doing his business. So everyone has got some qualification, by nature's gift. One bird can go seven miles away and he can see where is his food. You cannot see half amileeven. What is the value of your eyes in comparison to that bird? There are so many wonderful things done by the animals, without any scientific knowledge, so-called scientific knowledge. So scientific knowledge for material comforts, that knowledge is there even in the birds and beasts, for material comforts. They know how to do it. Why these laboratories? There is no need of. Because if your knowledge is for these four things, eating, sleeping and mating, then what is the value of such knowledge? The bird will also die after eating, sleeping. You'll also die after eating, sleeping. Then where is the advancement of knowledge. You have not improved in any way than the birds and the beasts. You cannot check death. The bird also cannot check death. Then where is the advancement? Simply the bird is finding out food by the beaks, and you eat on a table, chair. Therefore you are advanced? You are also eating, he's also eating. He's eating his own way. You are eating in his own way. Does it mean advancement? But when death comes, the bird will be also kicked out, you'll be also kicked out. Then where is your advancement."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Advancement in sensual science.,Prabhupāda,"But that is not advancement. That is wasting time. Suppose primitive man, he has got also sensual engagement. Does the primitive man has no sex life? He has got his woman. He has got sex life. The dog has got sex life. The cat has got sex life. You have got sex life. And because you have your sex life nicely dressed, you are advanced? This is foolishness. We have to see the result.Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁca.These four things, eating, sleeping, sex life and defence, even you'll find in the birds and beasts. And you are, if you are engaged in these four things, in so-called scientific way, then where is your advancement? When death will come, your science will not save you. As the bird will not be saved, you'll not be saved. Then where is your advancement? You are going on the motor car, say, twenty miles. One bird can fly fifty miles. Even he's more expert. I have seen in the ship, the skylark they go equal speed. The ship is running on, twenty-five miles speed or thirty miles. They're going. So where is your expert? By nature, it is expert. Just like these dogs, they are jumping with great force in the ocean and they'll come back; similarly you also go with your surf, and again come back. Where is the difference between this dog and you? So you have to compare that where, where is your advancement of knowledge? Advancement of knowledge means to mitigate, minimize miseries of life. That is called advancement of knowledge. But you... The real miseries of life is birth, death, old age and disease. You cannot do anything. So where is your advancement of knowledge? The scientists cannot stop death, cannot stop birth. They are inventing so many chemical contraceptive methods. But the statistic is population is increasing. Even they're unsuccessful in this account. The statistics is that every minute or second, three persons are increasing all over the world. Where is your contraceptive? You cannot check even birth. Birth,de... andBhagavad-gītāsays: ""These are real problems, birth, death, old age and disease."" So what you have done about these things? We have to see. Then we can accept that you are advanced."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They don't want to think about it.,Prabhupāda,"Because they cannot do anything. Just like some foolish animal. When there is danger, they close the eyes."
Brahmānanda,The rabbit.,Prabhupāda,"They think that: ""My danger is over. Because I do not see anymore."" Yes. So many animals, they die. Monkeys, rabbits, they die. When there is danger, they close the eyes. That's all. So similarly these rascals, they cannot make any solution of these problems, therefore they set aside. Don't trouble. What is this advancement? They are constructing big, big houses with a hope they'll live in this house comfortably. But any day we'll be kicked out: ""Get out."" What he can do? Why he's laboring so much? Suppose if you are constructing some house, if somebody says that you are going to die tomorrow, will you do it?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:I don't (indistinct),Prabhupāda,"No sane man will do it. But death is sure. You are making very nice foundation. But you'll have to leave. You cannot remain there. That, they do not know. Jawaharlal Nehru worked for...Gandhiworked for his country so much. Now where they are? Nobody knows."
Brahmānanda,Where?,Prabhupāda,"Where is Jawaharlal Nehru,MahatmaGandhi? They worked so hard for nation. Now he's dead and gone. Now where he is? Neither the nation knows. Whether he has now... Some astrologer told that he has become a dog in Sweden."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:He has become a dog...?,Prabhupāda,Dog.
Brahmānanda,Nehru.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. There is possibility.Dehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Change of body. So if... According to laws of nature, you have to change your body. You cannot dictate the laws of nature that: ""Give me this body. Give me again American body."" That is not possible. When you are dead, you have to accept another body. It may be cat's body, dog's body. It doesn't matter. You cannot dictate nature that: ""Give me a body like this."""
Brahmānanda,"Just like when the magistrate gives you a sentence, you cannot say: ""Oh, give me this sentence..."" No, you must accept.",Prabhupāda,No.
Brahmānanda,...what the punishment is.,Prabhupāda,"That is not possible. Neither you can say the magistrate partial, the judge. Somebody, he gives, ""Give him degree for one million dollars."" Another: ""Hang him."" So the judge is not partial. He is getting his money. He's getting his punishment. He's simply making judgement. He's not impartial. He's not enemy to anyone or friend to anyone. Similarly according to your work, you'll get punishment or reward by God. God is not partial."
Brahmānanda,"That's another argument they give that when there's some calamity, then they say: ""Oh,..."" Then they blame the Supreme...",Prabhupāda,God.
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"And when there's profit, that is His credit. Then he'll say: ""Oh, I have worked so hard. Now I have got this profit."" And when there is calamity, ""Oh, what can I do, it is God's desire."""
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Śrīla Prabhupāda, we experience almost daily that we suffer so much. So we see almost daily that people are dying, they are killed in the car accident...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:...burned in houses...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:...so many things. We experience almost daily.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Still people seem to not think about...,Prabhupāda,"InBhagavad-gītāit is said:duḥkhālayam.This is a place for suffering only. This material world is a place for suffering. It is stated in theBhagavad-gītā:duḥkhālayam...And that suffering, that also you, you cannot make any, what is called, compromise. ""All right, it is suffering. I shall remain here."" But that also you cannot. Some day nature will kick you out. ""Get out.""Duḥkhālayamaśāśvatam[Bg.8.15].Even if you accept this place of misery to be your permanent residence, that also you cannot have. You have to go out. Today or tomorrow or fifty years after, you have to go. That is the mistake. I am thinking: ""Now I have got this American body, or this body, that body. I am very happy."" But how long you'll remain in this condition? Any moment, you will be kicked out. This is laws of nature. Therefore my intelligence will, will be shown when we are trying for the real eternal life. That is (indistinct)."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So this suffering is all due to the desire of the individual souls.,Prabhupāda,"That... The...suffering is there. Suppose you are in the ocean. It is suffering, but if you have got a good ship, you may think that: ""I'm very well situated."" That good ship also can sink at any moment. Suffering is always there. You cannot avoid the suffering. Because you are in the ocean. Suppose you are in the air in a very nice plane. Does it mean you are secure? Any moment it can be... There is dangers everywhere. Therefore this place is always dangerous.Padaṁpadaṁyadvipadām[SB10.14.58],always dangerous. So the real intelligence means you have to find out where there is no danger. That is the... Where there is real happiness. In the material world, we cannot have happiness."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So without the proper guidance...,Prabhupāda,Hmmm?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Without the proper guidance...?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, everything requires guidance. You are working in the laboratory under guidance. Similarly, everything requires guidance. Just like these small birds. First of all, they learn with the mother. The mother goes and they go. The mother come back, they come back. So guidance. Nature's way, guidance. And when they become little habituated, then without mother, they can do their business. That guidance is there everywhere.HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa... (pause—break)...kaunteyaduḥkhālayamaśāśvatam, nāpnuvanti[Bg.8.15].""Anyone who reaches Me, he does not come back to this material world full of miseries and temporary life."" That means anyone who goes back to home, back to Godhead, there is no misery, there is no temporary life. It must be the opposite.Māmupetyapunarjanmaduḥkhālayamaśāśvatam, nāpnuvanti[Bg.8.15].Saṁsiddhiṁparamām...That is highest perfection.Paramām.Saṁsiddhiṁparamām.Every... all this scientific research is going on for perfection. They say the world is imperfect. That's, that is a fact. Imperfect. Imperfect means here you cannot get happiness and cannot live permanently. This is imperfection. That they do not know. That question they set aside. The problem, if you say to the scientist: ""What you have done for the human society to live eternally in perfect happiness?"" What is their answer?"
Brahmānanda,They do just the opposite. They accelerate the death and they create more problems.,Prabhupāda,That's it. That's it.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They will say that they are trying.,Prabhupāda,That is nonsense. Therefore we kick on your face. (laughter) Therefore we have got the right to kick on your face. (laughter) Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They have now some theories how to prolong life, how to live longer.",Prabhupāda,"What is that? Even if you live longer, does it mean that eternal life? That is already there. I'll live for eighty years. Another lives, for, say, sixty years. Another lives for hundred years. That is already there. The trees live for thousands of years. Does it mean it is life? A tree lives for... In yourSanFrancisco there is a tree which is said seven thousand years. Does it mean it is life? To live for so long duration of life? Then the tree is better than you. It is also living. Śaṅkarācārya lived for thirty-two years. LordCaitanyalived for forty-eight years. So what is the use of living for hundred years? Who is more famous than Śaṅkarācārya andCaitanyaMahāprabhu? So you live for a moment. But live worth. Then it is life. And living for seven thousand years, standing like the tree, is that life?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Like the (indistinct) says, ""One crowded hour of glorious life is worth a day without a name.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That's a fact.Kalpa-sthāyinoguṇāḥ.CāṇakyaPaṇḍitasays that if you have got qualities, then you live for millions of years. Millions of years. If you have got quality. And if you have no quality, then living for thousands of years like the tree, what is the use? Is that very glorious life to stand up in a place like a tree for thousands of years? Actually they do not know what is the value of life. [Break] ...how people are busy here. And we see how people are wasting time. This is the vision."
Brahmānanda,They say progress.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Progress towards death. That's all. That the animal has got also. They're also progressing. The frog,caca canh,caca canh, progress. The progress is that the snake is coming nearer,kāla-sarpa.(pause) Not a single instance of these birds being overpowered by the waves. They're so expert. Not touching the water, although working with big, big waves. Wherefrom he got this knowledge? You can study. You stand. Not a single instance you'll find that it is overpowered by the waves. Immediately comes. Spontaneously."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Kṛṣṇawithin is directing.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He's directing you also. But these, how this direction takes place? According to your desire. If you want to be cheated,Kṛṣṇawill direct you how you become cheated."
Brahmānanda,From Him comes forgetfulness as also remembrance.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You don't want to understandKṛṣṇaandKṛṣṇawill give you such direction you'll never understandKṛṣṇa, life after life. SoKṛṣṇahas got two kinds of direction, according to my desire, positive and negative. (pause)Yeyathāmāṁprapadyantetāṁs tathaiva bhajāmyaham[Bg.4.11].As, as you want direction,Kṛṣṇawill give you direction."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Insects, flying insects...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. Who is giving direction? Who is giving direction that ""Some men are coming. Fly away."" They have got intelligence, how to protect. (pause) What is this tower?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Possibly a Coast Guard Tower.,Prabhupāda,Oh. (end of recording.) ...about animals not willing to die. Why? What is the psychology? Nobody wants to die.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They will ask: ""How do I know that animals do not want to die?""",Prabhupāda,"That is another foolishness. As soon as you want to kill, it cries. Man or animal, anyone. Even the trees, they feel pain. That is also... You do not know that?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,No. They feel pain. You know Jagadisha Bose's pulsitation...? What is called?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Pulsation?,Prabhupāda,"The trees feel when you cut, they feel. There is machine. They, he discovered this. You have not been in Calcutta, Sir Jagadish Institute?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Probably not.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He, he discovered this wireless, Marconi's. Marconi took advantage from him. They were talking together and when Marconi got the hint from him, he immediately published. it was his invention, Sir Jagadish. Therefore he invented this pulsation of the trees. and started the Sir Jagadish Institution in Calcutta. So there is painful feeling even of the trees, what to speak of others."
Brahmānanda,Even a small insect...,Prabhupāda,Anyone.
Brahmānanda,He'll run away so quickly. You try to go to him.,Prabhupāda,"As soon you try to kill or attack, then he protests. And there is feeling also. Why?HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇa..."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Because they want to enjoy the material world.,Prabhupāda,"If you say so, then material enjoyment or enjoyment, material or spiritual, it doesn't matter..."
Someone:,Someone:Good morning.,Prabhupāda,Good morning. Thank you. (indistinct) Then every living entity wants to enjoy. And that is theVedānta-sūtra. Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12).Why they want to enjoy?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Because that is the eternal position of the living being.,Prabhupāda,"His constitutional position isānandamaya,joyfulness, but he does not get here thatānanda.He's seeking thatānanda,but it is being checked by conditions. He cannot enjoy. There are so many impediments. Just like we want to walk. But there are so many impediments. We want to walk on the sea beach but there are so many obstacles. So my position is that I want to enjoy, and nature's position is that she will check it. She'll not allow. Why? Why I am put into this condition? What do the scientists reply, rascals?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They don't have any answer.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They don't have any answer.,Prabhupāda,That means they're rascals. They do not know.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So our answer will be because of the laws of nature?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Because we are under the laws of nature...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. But why...? I am against laws of nature. That is my question. Do you... If I am also nature's product, then why against laws of nature? Why?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:By forgetting my real relationship, I tend to rule over the laws of material nature.",Prabhupāda,"That I am struggling. That is my business here. I am simply struggling. Laws of nature is obstructing my process of enjoyment, and I want to enjoy. Why this position? We inquire these intelligent questions. What they are inquiring? They do not know what to inquire."
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Fools. Animals.
Brahmānanda,SanātanaGosvāmī also asked that question toCaitanyaMahāprabhu...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is, that is the question of human life, that: ""I want to enjoy. Why there is obstruction of my enjoyment?"" Then the next question will be then what I am and what is this nature? These are intelligent questions. That is calledbrahma-jijñāsā.Where shall I eat? Where shall I sleep? These are very minor questions. They are questions for animals. For the human being, this is the question, that ""I want to enjoy life. Why there are so many obstructions?"" This is human question. The animals, they do not question. They submit. Just like when you slay one animal, it submits. But a human being, there is law because human being is intelligent. So you cannot kill any other human being, you cannot murder. Then you'll be hanged. But they cannot make law. They're lower grade animals. They submit, somebody killing. But the objection is there, both by the human beings and the animals, that the: ""Why you are killing me?"" But he's helpless. The man has invented some means. So they have made their laws. But both of them are objecting. In your, in America somewhere, when I first came, there was some incidence that in a live store, they got some opportunity to flee away. Then all the cows were fleeing away. And they were shot down. They were stopped. They knew that: ""We are stocked here for being killed."" So they got some opportunity, going away. And there is always miserable condition. Just like why you have covered so much? Why you have spent for covering? This is also miserable condition. Miserable condition. In some other place, they are..."
Brahmānanda,It's too hot.,Prabhupāda,"Too hot. Electric fan required. So we are always in miserable condition. We are trying to avoid these waves so that I may not be in miserable condition by wetting my shoes. So there is always struggle. Nature is trying to put me in miserable condition, and I am trying to save myself or to keep myself comfortable. This is called struggle for existence. They say that the world is imperfect. They, do they not admit?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,So imperfect means it is not congenial for my joyful life. Therefore we are inventing something to become joyful.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is what scientists are trying.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is...,Prabhupāda,"That means you are struggling. That means you are in miserable condition. So why you are put into miserable condition? Why do they not ask this question? This is intelligence. You are submitting. You are trying to get out of the miserable condition, but you are unable. You are submitting. Therefore nature is very forceful.Daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14].You cannot surpass. It is not possible. Then the next question will be: ""How we can surpass?"" That is real inquiry."
Brahmānanda,How...?,Prabhupāda,...we can surpass.
Brahmānanda,"Oh, the misery.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Miserable conditions.,Prabhupāda,"The miserable conditions. So miserable condition is calledmāyā.The answer is in theBhagavad-gītā,how we can surpass.Māmevayeprapadyantemāyāmetāṁtarantite.Clear answer. ""Anyone who surrenders unto Me, he can get out of this miserable condition offered by themāyā."" They're eating the wet sand...(?) Again trying. This is struggle for existence. Survival of the fittest. Who survives? Who is the living entity who has surpassed the tribulations of material nature. Where is the fit? Darwin's theory: survival of the fittest. Who is that fit? Nobody's fit. Even the so-called scientists, they are also not fit. Professor Einstein, when there was death, he could not save. He must die. So nobody's fit. Where is the survival of the fittest? Simply struggle for existence. Survival of the fittest meansKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmetikaunteya[Bg.4.9].This is fittest."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They were talking about the temporary existence of the material body.,Prabhupāda,"Eh? That is foolishness. That is foolishness. Just like if you go into the sea and if you want to be comfortable. This is foolishness. You cannot be. You are animal of land. If you are put into the water, however, expert swimmer you may be, you'll not be comfortable. That's not possible. So you are spirit soul. You cannot be comfortable in the material world. You can struggle, but that is not possible. And they are simply giving bluff, ""In future, we shall, in future."" This is rascaldom. They don't admit that it is not possible. They simply give bluff: ""In future..."" You see. ""In future, it will be,"" we can also accept that, provided you have taken the proper means. But where is your future if you are wrongly directed? A child's future is bright when we see that he's being educated, he's going to school. But when he's playing on the street, where is his future? He has no future. He's wasting his time."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:That is the favorite theory for the scientists.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They like to do things in future.,Prabhupāda,"That is nonsense. We say it is nonsense. In future, it is all right. You say, ""In future..."", but where is your method for future prosperity? That I am talking... If a child is getting proper education, then we can say that he has got a good future. But if the child is wrongly directed, then where is his future? A patient who has gone to the physician and undergoing treatment, he can expect in future he will be cured. But if he's lying down on the bed, and does not know who is physician, then where is his future? He has no future. So all these leaders, they're rascals, and who are following these rascals, where is his future? He has no future. They're all rascals. Anyone accepting: ""This rascal is a great scientist."" So his future is doomed."
Brahmānanda,The blind leading the blind.,Prabhupāda,"That's all. They do not, he does not know what is future happiness. He does not know."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They don't want to admit that.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They say they cannot do at the moment, but somebody will come up in future so they can show. But they don't want to admit...",Prabhupāda,"So that's all right, but, at the present moment, you are rascal. Somebody when come, intelligent, that is another thing, but you are rascal. So why you are leading, cheating others? That is our protest, that you know that you are a rascal, and you are cheating others to become leader. That is our protest. Why should you cheat others?Mūḍhaḥ.If he says that: ""How do you know that I am rascal?"" Because you do not know God. Therefore you are rascal.Mūḍhaḥ.Namāṁprapadyantemūḍhāḥ[Bg.7.15].If you are, would have known what is God, then you would have surrendered to Him. Then you are intelligent. But because you do not surrender, you do not know what is God, therefore you are a rascal. This is the definition of rascal.Jñānavānmāṁprapadyate.And intelligent means one who surrenders. He's intelligent. One who does not, he's rascal."
Brahmānanda,We have to expose these rascals.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is our business. (pause)Namāṁprapadyantemūḍhāḥduṣkṛtino narādhama[Bg.7.15],always engaged in sinful activities. And because they are sinful, they have been given food by nature: ""Eat dog. Eat the snail. Eat stool."" Are these things eatables? And those who are intelligent,Kṛṣṇaconscious? For them, fruits, flowers,cāpāṭīs,nice things."
Brahmānanda,The swans and the crows.,Prabhupāda,The swans and the crows. So expose them as crows. (pause)
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The leaders in our society, nowadays, seems that they forget their own present moment, but they're thinking for their children, future.",Prabhupāda,"So how they are thinking? He does not know, what is the use of thinking rascally? One can think properly if he knows things. If he does not know, then what is the use of thinking? The madman also thinks. What is the use of such thinking? Now our thinking begins from theBhagavad-gītā.Kṛṣṇasays:dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā,tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].As the body's changing from childhood to boyhood, boyhood to youthhood, similarly the proprietor of the body will change this body. At the last moment. Death means changing of the body. This is the... Now we can think. When there is proper subject matter, then you can think, how it is, how the changes. You have no proper subject matter, nobody is to guide you. What is the value of your thinking? Like dogs and cats? You do not know how to think. That is possible. How to think, that is possible in human life. So if you don't take up opportunity, how to think, then what is the use of your thinking like cats and dogs? Simply wasting time. The valuable life, you are wasting. Making experiment in the laboratory, nonsensically, that from matter they'll create life. You see. How this nonsense...? What is the use of such thinking? Which is never possible. These rascals are thinking on that, in that way, that they'll in future produce life from matter which has never been possible in the history, past, present and they're thinking; ""Oh, bright future."" That potter's thinking. Yes."
Brahmānanda,"Actually, the future looks very dim because of the military. They've created such a military threat with their atomic bombs and armies and so on.",Prabhupāda,Mmm?
Brahmānanda,"The future is very bad because of their military burden. Atomic bombs. This is what the scientists have created. They're thinking a bright future, but actually the future is...",Prabhupāda,Very dark.
Brahmānanda,...seems very dark.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Idle brain is a devil's workshop. If they're not directed, then think like devil. We are thinking rightly because we are taking direction fromKṛṣṇa, the most perfect. Therefore our thinking has meaning. And what is the value of their thinking? It has no value. Now we are thinking... Just like, take the first instruction, that within this body there is the proprietor of the body. You can go on thinking: ""Then am I this body?"" So you can think on your finger. ""I am this finger?"" The answer from the within will come: ""No, you are not finger. It is your finger. It is your finger. You are not finger."" If I am finger, then if I cut my finger, why shall I not die? If I am finger? Therefore it is my finger. Just like I'll never think that I am this stick. It is my stick. That is thinking. That is thinking. If I wrongly think that I am this body, then your whole thinking process is wrong and they are thinking like that, that we are this body."
