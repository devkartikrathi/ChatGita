    },
    {
        "question": "All-attractive.",
        "answer": "Yes. So unless God is all-attractive, how can He be God? A man is important when he is attractive. Is it not?"
    },
    {
        "question": "It is so.",
        "answer": "So, God must be attractive, and attractive for all. Therefore, if God has any name, or if you want to give any name to God, only \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d can be given."
    },
    {
        "question": "But why only the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?",
        "answer": "Because He\u2019s all-attractive. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means \u201call-attractive.\u201d God has no name, but by His qualities we give Him names. If a man is very beautiful, we call him \u201cbeautiful.\u201d If a man is very intelligent, we call him \u201cwise.\u201d So the name is given according to the quality. Because God is all-attractive, the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be applied only to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means \u201call-attractive.\u201d It includes everything."

    {
        "question": "Is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attractive to rascals?",
        "answer": "Oh, yes! He was the greatest rascal also."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is that?",
        "answer": "Yes. Sometimes when R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b would go out, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would attack Her, and when She would fall down \u2013 \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, don\u2019t torture Me in that way\u201d \u2013 They would fall down, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would take the opportunity and kiss Her. [He laughs.] So, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was very pleased, but superficially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the greatest rascal. So unless rascaldom is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, how could rascaldom exist in the world? Our formula of God is that He is the source of everything. Unless rascaldom is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it could not be manifest here, because He is the source of everything. But His rascaldom is so nice that everyone worships His rascaldom."
    },
    {
        "question": "What about the rascals who are not so nice?",
        "answer": "No, rascaldom is not nice, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute. He is God. Therefore His rascaldom is also good. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-good. God is good."
    },
    {
        "question": "Yes.",
        "answer": "Therefore, when He becomes a rascal, that is also good. Rascaldom is not good, but when it is practiced by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a  that rascaldom is also good, because He is absolutely good. This one has to understand."

        "question": "Are there some people who do not find K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attractive?",
        "answer": "No. All people will find Him attractive. Who is not attracted? Just give an example: \u201cThis man or this living entity is not attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Just find such a person."

        "answer": "No, not God. His attraction is to become powerful. A man wants to become powerful or rich \u2013 is it not? But nobody is richer than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is attractive to him."

        "question": "If a person who wants to become rich prays to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, will he become rich?",
        "answer": "Oh, yes. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-powerful, if you pray to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to become rich, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will make you rich."
    },
    {
        "question": "If somebody lives an evil life but prays to become rich, he may still become rich?",
        "answer": "Yes. Praying to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not evil. [Chuckling] Somehow or other he prays to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so you cannot say that he is evil."

        "question": "\u201cEven if the most evil man prays to Me, he will be elevated.\u201d",
        "answer": "Yes. As soon as he begins to pray to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is not evil. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-attractive. It is said in theVedasthat the Absolute Truth, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the reservoir of all pleasure \u2013raso vai sa\u1e25.Everyone is hankering after someone because he realizes some mellow in it."
    },
    {
        "question": "Excuse me?",
        "answer": "Some mellow. Suppose a man is drinking. Why is he drinking? He is getting some mellow out of that drinking. A man is hankering after money because by possessing money he gets a mellow out of it."

        "question": "Without perfect knowledge, though, you can teach\u2009\u2026",

    },
    {
        "question": "Yes, but I should not claim to teach more than I know.",
        "answer": "Yes. That is not possible for any human being. A human being has imperfect senses. So how can he teach perfect knowledge? Suppose you see the sun as a disc. You have no means to approach the sun. If you say that we can see the sun by telescope and this and that, they are also made by you, and you are imperfect. So how can your machine be perfect? Therefore, your knowledge of the sun is imperfect. So don\u2019t teach about the sun unless you have perfect knowledge. That is cheating."
    },

        "question": "But what about teaching that it is supposed that the sun is 93,000,000 miles away?",
        "answer": "As soon as you say \u201cit is supposed,\u201d it is not scientific."

    },
    {
        "question": "They come from the same source as the water.",
        "answer": "Yes. You cannot manufacture water unless you have hydrogen and oxygen. So, there are vast oceans \u2013 not only this Atlantic and Pacific: there are millions of planets, and there are millions of Atlantic and Pacific oceans. So who created this water with hydrogen and oxygen, and how was it supplied? That is our question. Somebody must have supplied it; otherwise how has it come into existence?"

So, there is flour, and there is ghee [clarified butter], and she made apur\u012b.But unless there is ghee and flour, where is the chance of making apur\u012b?

        "answer": "So, I am giving an example. I am creating some energy by digesting the food, and that is maintaining my body. If your energy supply is not proper, then your body becomes weak or unhealthy. Your body is made out of your own energy. Similarly, this gigantic cosmic body \u2013 the universe \u2013 is made of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. How can you deny it? As your body is made out of your energy, so the universal body must be made by somebody\u2019s energy. That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

    },
    {
        "question": "The energy I obtain from my food.",
        "answer": "Somehow or other you have obtained that energy! And through that energy your hair is growing. So if your body is manufactured by your energy, similarly the whole gigantic manifestation is made of God\u2019s energy. It is a fact! It is notyourenergy."
    },
    {
        "question": "Yes. Oh, I see that.",
        "answer": "Yes, but who produced the sun? That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. The sun is simply heat, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,bh\u016bmir \u0101po \u2019nalo v\u0101yu\u1e25:\u201cAnala\u2013 heat \u2013 that is My energy.\u201d The sun is the representation of the heating energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is not your energy. You cannot say, \u201cThe sun is made by me.\u201d But somebody must have made it, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He did. So, we believe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

        "answer": "Yes. And therefore our knowledge is perfect. If I say that heat is the energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, you cannot deny it, because it is not your energy. In your body there is some certain amount of heat. Similarly, the sun\u2019s heat is someone\u2019s energy. And who is that person? That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cYes, it is My energy.\u201d So my knowledge is perfect. Because I take the version of the greatest scientist, I am the greatest scientist.

You cannot say that the things of this world are different from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they have no existence.

This is M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy \u2013 that because everything is made of God\u2019s energy, therefore everything is God. But our philosophy is that everything is God but also not God."

That is our philosophy.Acintya-bhed\u0101bheda\u2013 inconceivable difference and nondifference. In the material sense, you cannot conceive that a thing is simultaneously positive and negative. But that is the spiritual reality. And because everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can manifest Himself from any energy. Therefore, when we worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a form made of something \u2013 of earth, stone, metal, or something like that \u2013 that is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. You cannot say that it is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When we worship this metal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a [the Deity form in the temple], that is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That\u2019s a fact, because metal is an energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. Therefore, it is nondifferent from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so powerful that He can present Himself fully in His energy. So this Deity worship is not heathenism. It is actually worship of God, provided you know the process."

That attachment is the basic principle of material life. So, a woman is hankering for or seeking after the association of a man, and a man is hankering for or seeking the association of a woman. All the fiction novels, dramas, cinemas, and even ordinary advertisements that you see simply depict the attachment between man and woman.

        "answer": "Yes. So if you want to get liberation from this material world, then that attachment should be reduced to nil. Otherwise, simply further attachment. You will have to take rebirth, either as a human being or as a demigod or as an animal, as a serpent, as a bird, as a beast. You will have to take birth."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is that again?",
        "answer": "The attachment increases. The material attachment involves thinking \u201cI am this body, and because I have this body in this particular place, this is my country.\u201d And that is going on: \u201cI am American, I am Indian, I am German, I am this, I am that. This is my country. I shall sacrifice everything for my country and society.\u201d So in this way, the illusion increases. And under this illusion, when he dies he gets another body. It may be a superior body or an inferior body, according to his karma. So if he gets a superior body, then that is also an entanglement, even if he goes to the heavenly planets. But if he becomes a cat or dog, then his life is lost. Or a tree \u2013 there is every chance of it."

        "question": "To reduce it over the stages of your life?",
        "answer": "Yes. Reduce it. A boy is trained as a student up to age twenty-five, restricting sex life.Brahmac\u0101r\u012b.So, some of the boys remainnai\u1e63\u1e6dhika-brahmac\u0101r\u012b[celibate for life]. Because they are given an education and they become fully conversant with spiritual knowledge, they don\u2019t want to marry. And even if they do marry, sex life is restricted. But the basic principle is that one cannot have sex life without being married. Therefore in human society there is marriage, not in animal society."

        "answer": "Well, in America there are so many things that require reformation, and this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement will bring that. I went to your country and saw that the boys and girls were living like friends, so I said to my students, \u201cYou cannot live together as friends; you must get yourselves married.\u201d"
    },
    {
        "question": "Many people see that even marriage is not sacred, so they find no desire to marry. They see that often people get married, and if things are not proper they get a divorce so very easily. Therefore many people feel that to get married is not meaningful.",
        "answer": "Yes. When milk is available in the marketplace, what is the use of keeping a cow? [Everyone laughs.] It is a very abominable condition in the Western countries. I have seen it. Here also, in India, gradually it is coming. Therefore we have started this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to educate people in the essential principles of spiritual life. It is not a sectarian religious movement. It is a cultural movement for everyone\u2019s benefit."

        "question": "Is the real goal of life to know God?",
        "answer": "Yes. To go back home, back to Godhead. That is the real goal of life. The water that comes from the sea forms clouds, the clouds fall down as rain, and the actual goal is to flow down the river and again enter the sea. So, we have come from God, and now we are embarrassed by material life. Therefore, our aim should be to get out of this embarrassing situation and go back home, back to Godhead. This is the real goal of life."

Tattvata\u1e25means \u201cperfectly.\u201d Perfect knowledge is being taught in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.So, we are giving everyone in human society a chance to learn theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is and make his life perfect.

    {
        "question": "Science may, though, say something. It is said in science that energy is never destroyed; it is changed.",
        "answer": "That\u2019s all right. But how is the energy working in the future \u2013 that science does not know. How is the energy diverted? How, by different manipulations, is the energy working differently? For instance, electrical energy. By different handling it is operating the heater and it is operating the refrigerator. They are just the opposite, but the electrical energy is the same. Similarly, this energy \u2013 living energy \u2013 how is it being directed? Which way is it going? How is it fructifying in the next life? That they do not know. But in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101it is very simply stated,v\u0101s\u0101\u1e41si j\u012br\u1e47\u0101ni yath\u0101 vih\u0101ya:You are covered by a shirt and coat.

        "question": "You have removed yourself from karmic influences. If I were to remove myself from karmic influences, would our souls be the same or different?",
        "answer": "The soul is of the same quality in all. You are under a certain conception of life at the present moment, and these countrymen of yours [gestures to the devotees present] were under a certain conception of life, but by training they have taken to another conception of life. So the ultimate training is how to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. That is the perfection."

        "question": "[pointing to two devotees] If these two are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, are their souls the same?",
        "answer": "The soul is the same but always individual, even if one is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. For instance, you are a human being, and I am a human being. Even if I am not a Christian, even if you are not a Hindu, still we are human beings. Similarly, the soul may not be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or he may be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. But the soul is the soul."

    },
    {
        "question": "How do you feel God inside you?",
        "answer": "Not in the beginning, but you have to know from the\u015b\u0101stras[scriptures], by the Vedic information. For example, in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[18.61] it is said,\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be \u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati:God is there in everyone\u2019s heart.Param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham:God is also within every atom.

        "question": "Chanting.",
        "answer": "Yes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Through this I can feel not only God outside but God inside?",
        "answer": "You\u2019ll understand everything of God \u2013 how God is inside, how God is outside, how God is working. Everything will be revealed. By this attitude of service, God will reveal Himself. You cannot understand God by your endeavour. Only if God reveals Himself. For instance, when the sun is out of your sight at night, you cannot see it by your torchlight, or any light. But in the morning you can see the sun automatically, without any torchlight. Similarly, you have to create a situation \u2013 you have to put yourself in a situation \u2013 in which God will be revealed. It is not that by some method you can order God, \u201cCome. I will see You.\u201d No, God is not your order-carrier."

        "answer": "You have to carry out his orders, that\u2019s all. God\u2019s representative is the guru. He asks you to do this, to do that \u2013 if you do that, that is pleasing.Yasy\u0101pras\u0101d\u0101n na gati\u1e25 kuto \u2019pi:If you displease the spiritual master, then you are nowhere.

        "answer": "The guru is the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So there are symptoms of who is a guru. The general symptoms are described in theVedas."

        "question": "But presently you do not receive information directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? It comes through the disciplic succession from the books?",
        "answer": "There is no difference. Suppose I say that this is a pencil. If you say to him, \u201cThis is a pencil,\u201d and if he says to another man, \u201cThis is a pencil,\u201d then what is the difference between his instruction and my instruction?"

    {
        "question": "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy allows you to know this now?",
        "answer": "You can take K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy also, provided it is delivered as it is. Just as we are teaching theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[18.66] K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:\u201cJust give up all other forms of religion and simply surrender unto Me.\u201d Now, we are saying that you should give up everything and surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction and our instruction. There is no deviation. So if you receive knowledge in that perfect way, that is as good as receiving instruction directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But we don\u2019t change anything."

        "question": "I have read that in life there are threegu\u1e47as \u2013passion, ignorance, and goodness. I was wishing that you would explain this somewhat, especially what is meant by the mode of ignorance and the mode of goodness.",
        "answer": "In goodness you can understand things \u2013 knowledge. You can know that there is God, that this world was created by Him, and so many things, actual things \u2013 the sun is this, the moon is this \u2013 perfect knowledge. If one has some knowledge, even though it may not be perfect, that is goodness. And in passion one identifies with his material body and tries to gratify his senses. That is passion. And ignorance is animal life \u2013 in ignorance, one does not know what is God, how to become happy, why we are in this world. For example, if you take an animal to the slaughterhouse, it will go willingly. This is ignorance. But a man will protest. If a goat is to be killed after five minutes but you give it a morsel of grass, it is happy because it is eating. That is ignorance."

    },
    {
        "question": "So, cheating and things like that \u2013 what mode is that?",
        "answer": "Cheating is mixed passion and ignorance. Suppose one man cheats another. That means he wants to obtain something; he is passionate. But if he commits murder, he does not know that he will have to suffer for it. So it is a mixture of passion and ignorance."

        "answer": "That may still be goodness. But in your Bowery Street, they give someone charity, and immediately he purchases a bottle of wine and drinks and lies down flat. [All laugh.] So that is charity, but that is not goodness; that is ignorance."
    },
    {
        "question": "Charity can be ignorance?",
        "answer": "There are three kinds of charities \u2013 in goodness, passion, and ignorance. Charity in goodness means giving charity where charity must be given. Just like this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement \u2013 if anyone gives charity to this movement, that is charity in goodness because it is spreading God consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is charity in goodness. And if one gives charity for some return, that is charity in passion. And if somebody gives charity at an improper place and time, without respect, and to an unworthy person, just like the Bowery man, that is charity in ignorance. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,yat karo\u1e63i yad a\u015bn\u0101si yaj juho\u1e63i dad\u0101si yat:\u201cWhatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform \u2013 do that as an offering to Me.\u201d [G\u012bt\u0101. 9.27] If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes your offering, that is the perfection of charity. Or anyone who is a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 if he takes it, that is perfection."
    },
    {
        "question": "And what kind of charity is it when you give food to somebody who is hungry?",
        "answer": "Well, that depends on the circumstances. For example, if a doctor has forbidden his patient to take any solid food, and if the patient is asking, \u201cGive me some solids,\u201d and if you give him solid food in charity, then you are not doing good to him. That is ignorance."

Is it not? Sometimes they will advertise, \u201cOur customers are our masters.\u201d Is it not? But in spite of the flowery language \u2013 \u201cOur customers are our masters\u201d \u2013 this is business, because nobody is a qualified customer unless he pays. But service is not like that.

I have given the example many times that a screw which has fallen from a machine has no value, but when the same screw is again attached to the machine, it has value. Similarly, we are part and parcel of God. So without God, what is our value? No value! We should again come back to our position of attachment to God. Then we have value."

But when the floods came and the people saw hardship, he lost faith and now he has no religion. He said he now finds his happiness in trying to develop love among people. I couldn\u2019t think of what to say to him to add God and religion to his life. He said that after he dies \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll become part of God, maybe not,\u201d but he can\u2019t worry about it now. He said he\u2019s tried various religious experiences, but they didn\u2019t work. One reason I ask this is because when I go back to America, a lot of people I come across are like this. They see that religion, like his worship of K\u0101l\u012b or other kinds of religion they\u2019ve experienced, doesn\u2019t work. And I don\u2019t know what to say to them to convince them it\u2019s worth trying.",

When you are again taken up on the land, then you\u2019ll be happy. Similarly, since we are part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we cannot be happy without acting as part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The same example as before: the machine part, fallen out of the machine, has no value, but when it is again put into the machine it has value. We are part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; we must join K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And you can join K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately by your consciousness, simply by thinking \u201cI am K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is mine.\u201d That\u2019s all."

For example, in your childhood you were not educated, but now you are educated. If you are serious you can keep yourself pure anywhere. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you stay in America or India.

That is our mission: we want to see everyone happy.Sarve sukhino bhavantu.People do not know how to become happy. They do not take the standard path to become happy. They manufacture their own way. That is the difficulty.

When the living entities forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they are in this material world. \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d means His name, His form, His abode, His pastimes \u2013 everything. When we speak of a king, it means the king\u2019s government, his palace, his queen, his sons, his secretaries, his military strength, his activities \u2013 everything. Is it not?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Yes.",
        "answer": "Similarly, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as soon as we think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, this means we are in touch with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and all His energies. That is complete by saying \u201cR\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d R\u0101dh\u0101 represents all the energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord. So when we speak of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the living entities are also included because the living entities are one of the energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 His superior energy. When this energy is not serving the energetic, that is material existence. The whole world is not serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Or, they are serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indirectly, just as disobedient citizens serve the government indirectly. Prisoners come to the prison house on account of their disobedience of the laws of the state. But in the prison house they are forced to obey the laws of the state. Similarly, all the living entities here are godless, either by ignorance or by choice. They do not like to accept the supremacy of God. Demoniac. So we are trying to bring them to their original condition. That is the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement."

Do we get sick because of our bad actions in the past?",

Similarly, even if a devotee who has surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is suffering from material consequences, that is temporary. Therefore, a devotee does not take any material miseries as miseries. He takes them as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, God\u2019s, mercy."

So perfection comes when one realizes that he is not this body; he is spirit soul. That is thebrahma-bh\u016btastage, called Brahman realization. That is perfection. Andsa\u1e41siddhi,complete perfection, comes after Brahman realization, when one engages in devotional service. Therefore if one is already engaged in devotional service, it is to be understood that Brahman realization is there. Therefore it is calledsa\u1e41siddhi."

But these Christian people have made it a law for Christ to suffer while they do all nonsense. Such great fools they are! They have let Jesus Christ make a contract for taking all their sinful reactions so they can go on with all nonsense. That is their religion. Christ was so magnanimous that he took all their sins and suffered, but that does not induce them tostopall these sins. They have not come to that sense. They have taken it very easily: \u201cLet Lord Jesus Christ suffer, and we\u2019ll do all nonsense.\u201d Is it not?"

I should not put him again into suffering.\u201d Of course, when the spiritual master is suffering, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saves him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thinks, \u201dOh, he has taken so much responsibility for delivering fallen persons.\u201d So K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati:\u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d The spiritual master is protected because he takes the risk on account of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "answer": "So long as you are in the material world, you cannot neglect physical laws. Suppose you go to a jungle and there is a tiger.

It is not that he has lost his individuality. He keeps his individuality. Just like Arjuna: in the beginning he was declining to fight on account of his individuality. But when he accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master, he became a disciple. Then whatever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ordered, he said yes. That doesn\u2019t mean he lost his individuality.

Suppose I like something but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cNo, you cannot use it.\u201d Then I shall not use it. I give it up for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sake. Positively, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI like these things.\u201d So we have to offer to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a what He likes, and then we takepras\u0101dam.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a likes R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b.

He is not hankering after your food. He accepts your devotion,bhakti.The real thing is devotion, not the food. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not accept any food of this material world.

So if the cook offers something last class, he is not performing his duty. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can accept anything if it is offered by a devotee, and a devotee can accept anypras\u0101dam,even if it is spicy. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu gave his son poison, and after offering it to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the son drank it as nectar and remained unharmed."

        "answer": "The animal is very innocent. If you cut its throat, it won\u2019t protest. So innocence is not a very good qualification. Our proposition is that one must be very, very intelligent, and then he can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To become an innocent, ignorant simpleton is not a very good qualification. Simplicity is all right, but one should not be unintelligent."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you tell me what intelligence is?",
        "answer": "Intelligence means to know what one is, what this world is, what God is, and what their interrelations are. The animal does not know what he is. He thinks that he is the body. Similarly, anyone who does not know what he is is not intelligent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What about a person who tries to do what is right and is very conscientious about the things he does? Like the servant who is very honest to his master but knows that if he were not honest he would not be caught. If a person like that stays honest anyway, is that some kind of good karma?",
        "answer": "Yes, to become honest is also good karma. How to become a good man is described in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101very elaborately:daiv\u012b sampad vimok\u1e63\u0101ya nibandh\u0101y\u0101sur\u012b mat\u0101.So, if you become qualified withdaiv\u012b sampad,transcendental qualities, thenvimok\u1e63\u0101ya,you will be liberated. Andnibandh\u0101y\u0101sur\u012b \u2013if you have demoniac qualities you will be more and more entangled. Unfortunately, modern people do not know what is liberation and what is entanglement.

    },
    {
        "question": "I would say that honesty is doing what you really feel is right.",
        "answer": "A thief is feeling, \u201cI must steal to provide for my children. It is right.\u201d Does it mean that he is honest? The butcher thinks, \u201cI must cut the throat of the animals daily. It is my livelihood.\u201d N\u0101rada Muni once met a hunter and asked him, \u201cWhy are you killing in this way?\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, it is my business. My father taught it to me.\u201d The hunter was honestly doing his work. So, a feeling of honesty depends on culture. A thief\u2019s culture is different from ours. He thinks stealing is honest."
    },
    {
        "question": "So, what is honesty?",
        "answer": "Yes, that is my question. [Everyone laughs.] Real honesty is that you should not encroach upon another\u2019s property. This is honesty. For instance, this is my table. If you want to take it away, is that honesty? Therefore, the simple definition of honesty is that you should not encroach upon another\u2019s rights. That is honesty."
    },
    {
        "question": "So somebody who is honest would be in the mode of goodness? Would that be correct?",
        "answer": "Certainly, certainly. Because the mode of goodness means knowledge. So if you know, \u201cThis table does not belong to me; it belongs to Swamiji,\u201d you will not try to take it away. Therefore, one must know to whom things belong; then he can be honest."
    },
    {
        "question": "You have said that the mode of goodness was knowledge of God, but somebody may be honest without having very much knowledge of God. Without thinking they are honest because it is God\u2019s wish, they just feel like they ought to be honest.",
        "answer": "God wishes everyone to be honest. Why should God think otherwise?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you follow God\u2019s wishes without knowing you are following God\u2019s wishes?",
        "answer": "No, following without knowing \u2013 that is absurd. You must know the order of God. And if you follow that, then that is honesty."
    },
    {
        "question": "So somebody cannot really be honest without knowing God?",
        "answer": "Yes, because God is the supreme proprietor, the supreme enjoyer, and the supreme friend. That is the statement of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.If anyone knows these three things, then he is in full knowledge. These three things only: that God is the proprietor of everything, God is friend of everyone, and God is the enjoyer of everything. For example, everyone knows that in the body the stomach is the enjoyer \u2013 not the hands, legs, eyes, ears. These are there simply to help the stomach. For example, the eyes \u2013 the vulture goes seven miles up to see where there is food. Then the wings fly there, and the jaws catch the food. But the ultimate enjoyer of the food is the stomach. Is it not?"
    },
    {
        "question": "That is so.",
        "answer": "Similarly, as in this body the stomach is the enjoyer, the central figure of the whole cosmic manifestation, material or spiritual, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, God. He is the enjoyer. We can understand this just by considering our own bodies. The body is also a creation. The body has the same mechanical nature you will find in the whole universe. The same mechanical arrangement will be found anywhere you go, even in animals. In the human body or in the cosmic manifestation \u2013 almost the same mechanism. So you can understand very easily that in this body \u2013 any body, your body \u2013 the stomach is the enjoyer. There is a central enjoyer. And the stomach is the friend also. Because if you cannot digest food, you see, then all other limbs of the body become weak. Therefore the stomach is the friend. It is digesting and distributing the energy to all the limbs of the body. Is it not?"
    },
    {
        "question": "It is so.",
        "answer": "Similarly, the central \u201cstomach\u201d of the whole creation is God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the enjoyer, He is the friend, and, as the supreme proprietor, He is maintaining everyone, just as a king can maintain the whole country\u2019s citizens because he is the proprietor. Without being the proprietor, how can one become everyone\u2019s friend?"
    },
    {
        "question": "And then he may not go to hell?",
        "answer": "Yes. You save him from going to hell. Because a farthing spent for Krsna will be noted by Him: \u201cOh, this man has given a farthing.\u201d This is calledaj\u00f1\u0101ta-suk\u1e5bti[devotional service performed unknowingly]. People are generally very poor in their thought; therefore the saintly persons move among them just to enlighten them a little, to give them a chance to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the saintly person\u2019s duty. But if someone takes money from others and utilizes it for his sense gratification, then he goes to hell. Then he is finished. He is a cheater, a criminal. You cannot take a farthing from anyone and use it for your own sense gratification."

        "answer": "But the man who is thinking he is not stealing is also a thief because he does not know that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, whatever he is accepting, he is stealing."

        "question": "But maybe if I know it is yours and I take it I am a worse thief than if I do not know whose it is. I just think it may be nobody\u2019s, and I take it.",
        "answer": "That is also stealing, because it must belong to somebody. And you are taking it without his permission. You may not know exactly who the proprietor is, but you know it must belong to someone. Sometimes we see on the road so many valuable things left there \u2013 government property for repairing roads or some electrical work. A man may think, \u201cOh, fortunately these things are lying here, so I may take them.\u201d Is it not stealing?"
    },
    {
        "question": "It is stealing.",
        "answer": "Yes. He does not know that it is all government property and he takes it away. That is stealing. And when he is caught, he is arrested, and he is punished. So, similarly, whatever you are collecting\u2009\u2026\u00a0Suppose you are drinking a glass of water from the river. Is the river your property?"
    },
    {
        "question": "No.",
        "answer": "Then? It is stealing. You have not created the river. You do not know who is the proprietor, but it is not your property. So, even if you drink a glass of water without knowing to whom it belongs, you are a thief. So you may think, \u201cI am honest,\u201d but actually you are a thief. You must remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u201cOh, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is Your creation, so kindly allow me to drink.\u201d This is honesty. Therefore a devotee always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In all activities: \u201cOh, it is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s.\u201d This is honesty. So without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, everyone is a rascal, a thief, a rogue, a robber."

        "answer": "And is there another way? [Bob laughs.] Is there any other way? Defy it! [Bob laughs again. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da also laughs.] Is there an alternative? We do not say anything that can be defied by anyone; that experience we have. Rather, we defy everyone: \u201cAny questions?\u201d Till now, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given us protection. In big, big meetings in big, big countries, after speaking I ask, \u201cAny questions?\u201d"
    },
    {
        "question": "Now I have none.",
        "answer": "In London, we had lectures for twelve days in Conway Hall. So after every meeting I asked, \u201cAny questions?\u201d"
    },
    {
        "question": "Did you get many questions?",
        "answer": "Oh, yes. But many were foolish questions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Let me ask one more question. What is being foolish?",
        "answer": "Well, that is not a fault. Suppose you are trying to do something, but due to your inexperience you sometimes fail. That is not a fault. You are trying. A verse in theBh\u0101gavatamsays that if a devotee is trying his best but due to his incapability he sometimes fails, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a excuses him. And in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[9.30] K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,api cet su-dur\u0101c\u0101ro bhajate m\u0101m ananya-bh\u0101k s\u0101dhur eva sa mantavya\u1e25.\u201cSomeone may commit the most abominable activity, but if he is worshiping Me sincerely he should be considered a saintly person.\u201dSometimes one does something nonsensical unwillingly, due to past bad habits. That does not mean he is faulty. But he must repent for what he has done. And he should try to avoid it as far as possible. But habit is second nature. Sometimes, in spite of your trying hard,m\u0101y\u0101is so strong that it trips you with pitfalls. That can be excused. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a excuses. But those who are doing something willingly are not excused. On the strength that I am a devotee, if I think, \u201cBecause I am chanting, I may therefore commit all this nonsense and it will be nullified,\u201d that is the greatest offense."
    },
    {
        "question": "I received your very kind letter about a week ago.",
        "answer": "Yes, provided you are qualified. Those who are qualified know. But for those who do not know, nature will arrange things. If you do not know, this means you have not prepared your life. So at the time of death your mentality will create another body, and nature will supply it."

    {
        "question": "If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a controls everything, how does K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a control a nondevotee?",
        "answer": "Bym\u0101y\u0101.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a controls this world just as the government controls everything. A kingdom is controlled by the king\u2019s departments."
    },
    {
        "question": "And how does K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a control a devotee?",
        "answer": "Just as you control your beloved. For example, if you have a beloved child, you control him for his benefit. If he is going to touch fire, you will immediately tell him, \u201cNo, no, my dear child. Don\u2019t touch it.\u201d So a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, a devotee, is never misled, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always guiding him, whereas those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious are in the charge ofm\u0101y\u0101,andm\u0101y\u0101will do the needful, as you have seen."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the time that we\u2019ll die preset when we\u2019re born? When I\u2019m born, do I have a certain given life span?",
        "answer": "Not preset. That you can do because you have a little independence. It is not natural to commit suicide. But because we have independence, we can go from nature to \u201cun-nature.\u201d A prisoner cannot go out of the prison house naturally. But if somehow or other he arranges to jump over the wall and escapes, then he becomes eligible for further imprisonment. He will be arrested again, and his term of imprisonment will be increased. So, naturally we cannot violate destiny. But if we do it, then we will suffer. But our destiny can be changed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when we are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. We do not do it, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will do it. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi:\u201cI shall give you protection.\u201d That change takes place for my protection."
    },
    {
        "question": "That is so.",
        "answer": "But he is thinking, \u201cI am the master of the dog.\u201d A family man is controlled by his wife, his children, his servants, everyone, but he is thinking, \u201cI am master.\u201d President Nixon is thinking that he is master of his country, but he is controlled. At once he can be dismissed by the public, his servants! At election time he will take a position, claiming, \u201cI will give you very good service,\u201d and \u201cI shall be a first-class servant.\u201d Therefore people vote, \u201cAll right, you become president.\u201d And he is advertising: \u201cReelect me! Reelect me!\u201d That means he is a servant. But he is thinking, \u201cI am the master.\u201d That is illusion,m\u0101y\u0101.One who is controlled bym\u0101y\u0101thinks himself the master while he is a servant. But a devotee never thinks, \u201cI am the master,\u201d only \u201cI am K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s servant.\u201d That ismukti,liberation. A devotee is never controlled by false thoughts. He knows his position \u2013svar\u016bpena vyavasthiti\u1e25. Mukti,liberation, means to be situated in one\u2019s own constitutional position as a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So if I know that I am a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is my liberation. And if I think that I am the master, that is bondage. This is the difference between liberated life and conditioned life."

        "question": "Prabhup\u0101da, some religious people claim that Jesus is guiding them. Can this be so?",
        "answer": "Yes, but they are not taking the guidance. Jesus is guiding the Christians, telling them, \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d but they are killing. So how are they following Jesus\u2019 guidance? Simply saying \u201cI am guided by Jesus Christ, but I don\u2019t care for his words\u201d \u2013 will that do? Is that guidance? Nobody is being guided by Jesus Christ. Their claim is false. It is very hard to find a man who is actually being guided by Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ\u2019s guidance is available, but nobody is caring for him. They have taken Jesus Christ as contractor to take up their sins. That is their philosophy. They commit all kinds of sins, and poor Jesus Christ will be responsible. That is their religion. Therefore they say, \u201cWe have a very good religion. For all our sinful activities, Jesus Christ will die.\u201d Is that good religion? They have no sympathy for Jesus Christ. If they did they would think, \u201cHe died for our sins. Why should we commit sins again? Such a great life has been sacrificed for our sins, so we should be guided by Jesus Christ.\u201d But they take it otherwise: \u201cAh, I shall go on committing all sins, and Jesus Christ has made a contract to nullify all my sins; I\u2019ll simply go to the church and confess and come back and again do all nonsense.\u201d Do you think that shows very good intelligence?"
    },
    {
        "question": "No.",

        "question": "What about the \u201cJesus freaks,\u201d young people who read the Bible very often?",
        "answer": "But violence is against the Bible\u2019s injunctions. How can they kill if they are following the Bible?"
    },
    {
        "question": "They claim that the Bible says Jesus ate meat.",
        "answer": "That\u2019s all right. He may eat anything; he is powerful. But he has ordered, \u201cThou shalt not kill. You must stop killing.\u201d He is powerful. He can eat the whole world. But you cannot compare yourself to Jesus Christ. You cannot imitate him; you have to abide by his order. Then you are guided by Jesus Christ. That is actual obedience. TheBh\u0101gavatamexplains that one who is an\u012b\u015bvara,who is empowered, can do anything, but that we cannot imitate. We have to abide by his order."
    },
    {
        "question": "No.",
        "answer": "He cannot do that. That is real faith in him \u2013 to understand that he cannot do that. So why did he eat meat? He has his reasons why, but he has asked me not to kill. Therefore I have to follow. That is the real system. You are not Jesus Christ; you cannot imitate him. He has sacrificed his life for God. Can you do that? Why imitate Jesus Christ only by eating meat? Why not imitate Jesus Christ by sacrificing your life for spreading God consciousness? They are so-called Christians, but what are they doing for God? Consider how the sun is absorbing urine. Can you drink urine? If you want to imitate the sun and drink urine, can you? Similarly, Jesus Christ is so powerful he can do anything. But we cannot imitate; we have to simply abide by his order. That is real Christianity. It is wrong to imitate a powerful man."
    },
    {
