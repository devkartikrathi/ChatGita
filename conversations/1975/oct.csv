Brahmānanda,...possible to be a scientist and also be God conscious. Why not use science...,Prabhupāda,"That is real scientist. These are false scientists. Actually the Supreme Lord is the source of everything. So if one is actually scientist, by his scientific explanation he will point out, ""Here is the cause of all causes."" By scientific knowledge he will point out that God is the origin of everything. Then his scientific study is perfect. But these rascals, they are doing the opposite, that ""There is no need of God. Science is everything,"" although it is imperfect. That is their fault. Therefore they are rogues. They cannot prove; still, they will insist, ""Yes, we shall do. We are trying,"" like that, and misleading people. General people, they are rascal and fools. If you mislead them, they will be misled.Śūdra, mūḍhas.They are to be educated. Instead of educating them, they are making them more and more fools and rascals. [break] There is utility, but they have no utility. There is some service; they carry some passengers. They are carried nowhere. Simply they mislead. [break]"
Cyavana,"...lization, they feel that they need science. They've become dependent upon science. They feel that without science they cannot live.",Prabhupāda,Why?
Cyavana,The scientists have made them dependent.,Prabhupāda,"That is their foolishness. These rascals are fools. Therefore they have become dependent. Why science? What for? That is not... Science is required,vijñāna.That is nice. But they are not scientists."
Cyavana,"We ask them if they need eternal life. They say ""No, we don't need that. We need comforts.""",Prabhupāda,They... We are eternal.
Cyavana,"That ""We need our daily bread,"" like that.",Prabhupāda,"Where is comfort? You are going to die. Where is your comfort? You are going to be diseased. You are going to be old man like me. Every moment there is some trouble. So where is the comfort, rascal? That means misleading. There is no comfort; still, they are promising comfort. This is misleading. Where is comfort? Eh?"
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:There is no comfort.,Prabhupāda,"Huh? Where is comfort? If you have to die—""Oh, I am dying comfortably""—what is this nonsense? ""I am dying comfortably."""
Indian devotee man (1):,"Indian devotee man (1):Like yesterday night, that man. I asked him, (Hindi) So he said that ""I am all right."" But he was unable to sit on the chair.",Prabhupāda,So which way?
Cyavana,"To the park, straight.",Prabhupāda,"Comfort, where is your comfort? Why you have so many medical men if you are comfortable? Why there are so many drugs, medicine, if you are comfortable? This ismāyā.He is not in comfort; still, he will say that ""I am in comfort."" This is calledmāyā,illusion."
Brahmānanda,"So these drugs, even though one may be feeling pain, he can take the drugs and he won't feel pain.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. He will take injection. It is comfort. Daily he will take injection, and it is comfort. (laughter) Just see the fools and rascals.Mūḍha.[break] ...met so many medical men, doctors and quack. ""Die comfortably."" What is the use of this medical man, medicine? What is the use? If your comfort and death is comfortable, then why spend so much money? Die comfortably. Because you cannot check death, then why you are trying to check death? ""Let me live some years more. Let me take this medicine."" Why? Why this struggle? Die comfortably. Suffer disease comfortably."
Cyavana,They've made so much propaganda that life is meant to enjoy. Everywhere...,Prabhupāda,"Enjoy, but where is your enjoyment? Come to the practical point. Where is your enjoyment? You are simply suffering. That is their rascaldom. They are suffering; still, they say, ""I am enjoying."" This is called illusion,māyā.Enjoy. That we also say, that we are trying to take you to a certain place, kingdom of God or back..., where you will enjoy. Enjoy...Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12).That enjoy is our aim. But where is your enjoyment here? That is your rascaldom. There is no enjoyment; still, you say, ""We shall enjoy."""
Cyavana,Their propaganda leads people to think that they can enjoy... That it's possible here.,Prabhupāda,"They're misleading. That is misleading. We have to check that. That is ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness move..., that... They are not enjoying, and these rascals misleading them that they are enjoying. [break] Enjoyment is our aim also—but real enjoyment.Ramanteyogino 'nante satyānande. Satyānanda.Not thisānanda,temporaryānanda."
Cyavana,Eternal.,Prabhupāda,"Satyānanda-cid-ātmani.Yogis,bhakti-yogis,they also wantānanda,but not this falseānanda, satyānanda-cid-ātmāni,iti...Therefore they callRāma.Rāmameansramaṇa,enjoyment.Itirāma-padenāsauparaṁbrahmābhidhiyate[Cc.Madhya9.29].They do not know what issatyānanda.They do not understand, as soon as we accept this material body, it is misery, simply misery. The body is constructed within the womb of the mother in a miserable condition. These rascals, they do not understand. In a packed-up way, head down, leg up. And it is enjoyment. The body is created in this troublesome, from miserable condition; still, they say, ""enjoyment."" This is foolishness. This is called illusion."
Brahmānanda,"Sigmund Freud, his philosophy is that that position in the womb was one of great security, and we all want to go back to that position.",Prabhupāda,"Where is security? The mother is killing them, abortion. Where is security? The mother, under whose abdomen I have taken shelter, she is killing. Where is security?"
Indian man (1):,"Indian man (1):OneĀrya-samājīin Nairobi, he was saying that the body is only made in three months, not in seven months in the abdomen of a mother.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):He said the body only...,Prabhupāda,The body is made in one night.
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):He said that...,Prabhupāda,"No, he said. What he is? Body is made, one night, immediately. After sex it becomes emulsified, two secretion, and immediately a pealike form is there. That is body. And that grows."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Although everyone is suffering, however, they think that ""Because I am not suffering, everyone else is suffering, and that's okay."" They're thinking that the miseries are only for others.",Prabhupāda,"That is another ignorance. Everyone is dying. He is thinking, ""I will not die."" This is ignorance. He is running so fast unnecessarily."
Cyavana,He is trying to enjoy that machine.,Prabhupāda,"Enjoy means another machine willstrike, and his enjoyment will stop. There is ship, going fast. Where he will go fast?"
Brahmānanda,Around the island.,Prabhupāda,"Just like the dog. He goes fast here and there.""Gow! Gow!""(laughter) It is like that. He is going fast. Doggish mentality. That's all, all dogs and cats, no human being. This civilization means they are creating only dogs and cats, animals,go-kharaḥ,cows and asses. They are... We don't take them as human being. All animals."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Is that because they don't acknowledge that they're suffering?,Prabhupāda,So many things. So many things. The first ignorance is that accepting this body as self. Everyone.
Cyavana,The capitalists are so anxious for money that they exploit this tendency of the living entity to enjoy by tempting him. Every year they create some new way to entice him.,Prabhupāda,"And taxation. And the taxation is divided among them. The tax is meant for public welfare. Instead of public welfare, they divide it amongst themselves and enjoy wine, women, motorcar and flesh. That's all. This is going on. All this income tax-plundering process. This income tax means a plan how to take away everything from the actually earning members of the society. That is income tax. And that is divided amongst administrators. That's all."
Cyavana,"Here it is very prominent. The workers in the fields, they are barely making enough to live from day to day. But the planters who live in France, they are taking millions of rupees and living very comfortably.",Prabhupāda,Therefore Communism is coming. Go this way?
Cyavana,Is it this way? We can go this way. This way. Or better this way. Now he's coming the other way.,Prabhupāda,"[break] ...create another danger. Just like airplane. It is comfortable. You can quickly go from one place to another. But as soon as on the plane, immediately your life is at risk. There is no certainty. So this is the way of material world. You create some comfort and you create some greater danger also. Side by side. It cannot be unhampered comfort. That is not possible. You create a motorcar—the same thing—you drive very speedy and you meet accident. Railway, the accident. There was no need. You produce your food locally and produce your milk. Then eat, drink, and live comfortably. ChantHareKṛṣṇa. That is wanted. Make your life successful.Yaduttama-śloka-guṇānuvarṇanam[SB1.5.22].And if you have got education, then describe the glories of the Lord by your scientific and educational qualification.

Brahmānanda,"In theBiblethere are so many things that were... about the world that were mistakes, and then, by their scientific knowledge, they found the real fact. Like they say the earth was flat...",Prabhupāda,"Biblemay be wrong, but we are talking generally. So if you are scientist, you can say the right thing. But why should you deny God?"
Brahmānanda,"Well, if the book of God has made mistake, then we don't have any faith...",Prabhupāda,"Book of God... Then throw it. Kick it out. But I say that you are scientist. How you can deny God? That is our propaganda. The so-called book of God, you throw away. But you are scientist. How can you deny the existence of God? Why you are misleading?Biblemisleading, that's all right. Why you are misleading? That is our point."
Cyavana,For so many centuries they took theBibleto be the authority.,Prabhupāda,"All right, throw it away. You are scientist."
Cyavana,They won't.,Prabhupāda,"You are a scientist. How you can deny God? Then what kind of scientist you are? TheBiblehas done wrong. Throw it away. I have no objection. But you are scientist. How you can deny God? And that is our point. Come to this logic, that ""How we can deny God?"" You are speaking that from chemical combination life is formed. Do it in the laboratory. You cannot do it. Why you are propagating false propaganda? What kind of scientist? Then you are also to be kicked out. IfBibleis to be kicked out you are also to be kicked out. Why you are claiming your position? You prove first of all. You combine chemical and produce a life. And you are making false propaganda, so you are to be kicked out. They say, ""We shall do in future."" And what is the future? Then why you are at present making false propaganda. Wait for the future. Post-dated check. ""In future I shall pay."" Who will accept this check? Any nonsense will accept."
Brahmānanda,But this world is so imperfect...,Prabhupāda,The world is not imperfect; you are imperfect rascal. You are rascal; you are imperfect. World is not imperfect.
Brahmānanda,"Well, they have these cyclones. They come...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. Must come because you are to be killed. You are rascal; you are to be killed. Therefore God has created cyclone. You protect yourself if you are scientist, if you have got power."
Cyavana,Because they are anxious for some...,Prabhupāda,"Because God has created cyclone, therefore He is perfect because you are to be killed, blown away with your all paraphernalia, with your all scientific laboratory and instrument. Go. Go to hell. That is perfection."
Cyavana,They are eager to find a solution. Therefore they are forced to speculate because they have no other way...,Prabhupāda,No other way.
Cyavana,"They have no other way to learn, unless they will acceptVeda,which they won't accept. [break] ...sense gratification. They enjoy making so many theories.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes.Mano-ratha:""Chariot of mind."""
Cyavana,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Mano-rathenāsati dhāvatobahiḥ.By his chariot of the mind he will be driven to this material consciousness. [break] ...spiritual knowledge. Therefore, we see, big, big scientists, they are thinking that combination of matter can produce life. In spite of so much advanced learning, they do not know what is life. They cannot create life; still, they will theorize. How foolish they are. And as soon as you catch his throat, ""Produce life."" ""No, we shall do it in future."" Just see."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Sometimes people ask that ""If God is so great, then why doesn't He just come and destroy all the evil?""",Prabhupāda,Because you have to suffer. You are rascal. You must suffer. Therefore evil must be there.
Brahmānanda,Why doesn't He force us to be good?,Prabhupāda,"Just like if the criminals and thieves say, ""Why government has created this prisonhouse?"" Is it very good argument? It is for you, rascal. You are criminal. You must suffer. Why it is to be abolished? Otherwise who will suffer? It is for your suffering."
Brahmānanda,Why are we evil? Why doesn't God makes us good?,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Brahmānanda,Why are we evil?,Prabhupāda,"No, God says that ""You become devotee of Me."" You do not become. That is your fault. Therefore you must... Just like government does not say that you become criminal. Government says, ""You become educated. You become high-court judge, become big officer."" Why you become criminal, pickpocket? Does government give any education for becoming pickpocket? Hm? Is there any institution how to steal, how to become pickpocket? (laughter) Then why do you become? Just see. [break] ...eatables you can collect, and I shall show you how to cook in the cooker. One boy. You also see, because nobody will go there."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Harikeśais getting hisvisatoday.,Prabhupāda,So we can return. [break] Whole educational system is defective because there is no spiritual education. That has made everything impossible.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:One young boy in Johannesburg wanted to join us. He is sixteen years old. So his headmaster said, ""What you will do without an education?"" They think that this is the greatest ignorance. These are the leaders of education, the headmaster. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...spiritual education, he remains an animal. That's all. [break] That isVedānta-sūtra,athātobrahmajijñāsā.To find out the ultimate goal, that is education.Janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1],""Wherefrom everything is coming,"" that is education."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:But they may say, ""That is not practical, because we will starve to death with such knowledge.""",Prabhupāda,"Then... Then you are useless. Because you cannot go to the ultimate point of education, therefore your education is useless."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:But then they will ask, ""You will come and bring me food?""",Prabhupāda,"Yes, I will give you food. Food is there. You are not creating food. It is... From the earth it is grown."
Brahmānanda,But we have to work very hard; otherwise we won't get money for buying food.,Prabhupāda,No. You work a very slight three months in a year and get all food. Food is there; milk is there; land is there. You have to work.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Is it possible to take the mass of crowlike people and give them the higher taste?,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Is it possible to take a mass of crowlike people and elevate them?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Human beings, after all, they are. They can be educated. That is the opportunity of human life, that he can be educated. The cats and dogs cannot. [break]"
Cyavana,They're watching. [break],Prabhupāda,"...prominent. Red, yellow, and blue."
Cyavana,Violet is there.,Prabhupāda,"No. The mix, you make a hundred color, but three colors are prominent. Then you mix. You mix the green and yellow..., er, blue and yellow; it become green. You mix the red and yellow; it will become orange. You mix the blue and red; it become violet. Like that. Originally three colors."
Brahmānanda,They say from those three colors they can make actually thousands of different colors.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore three modes of material nature by mixture-8,400,000's of species of life, by different mixture. And when you come to the original color, then thebrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya...And then you transcend the color; you come to the spiritual life. [break]"
Bhārgava,"...prison. And then when he gets out of prison he has the memory of his punishment, and that acts as a deterrent to him committing the crime again. But if someone is sinful...

Still, he acts criminally. That is called ignorance. Heart is unclean. Therefore our first process isceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12],to cleanse the heart."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Pāpa-buddhi,sinful intelligence.",Prabhupāda,"To cleanse the heart, beginning of cleanse the heart, that everyone is cats and dogs and so-called human beings... They are under the bodily concept of life. It has to be cleansed, that ""You are not this body."" If he understands that, then he will understand other things. This is the beginning of knowledge. But where is that knowledge? No school, no college, teaches this thing. So they remain in ignorance. What is this education if he remains in ignorance? [break] ...kinds of advertisement."
Cyavana,That is their propaganda. [break],Prabhupāda,"There was no... We don't require all these things because we know others are victims. They pay for it. And they work hard for the money and pay to work. That's all. Our men never touch this Coca-cola and cigarette, but others, they aremadafter it."
Brahmānanda,"They say they have to work so hard to get food, but actually they are working hard for this.",Prabhupāda,"He'll get food. Food they can grow very easily, but they...Anartha.This is calledanartha.Anarthameans unnecessarily.Ādau śraddhtatasādhu-saṅgo 'thabhajana-kriy tato 'nartha-nivṛttisyāt.Soanartha-nivṛtticivilization, notanarthaincreasing.

Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:They also want to join thesaṅkīrtanamovement.,Prabhupāda,"They are dependent on mother, by nature dependent. Similarly, you should be dependent on the original source of emanation. This is nature. Why they are with the mother?"
Cyavana,Without the mother they cannot survive.,Prabhupāda,"No, without, they can survive; still, they are dependent."
Brahmānanda,"People who can't protect themselves, for people who cannot protect themselves, then they can have belief...",Prabhupāda,Then you can protect from death? Can you?
Brahmānanda,"But can God protect? Even Jesus Christ, he was killed.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. We are faulty. But you are so advanced. Do you protect yourself from death? We are faulty. That is your decision. That we admit. But what is your position? Protect yourself from death. At any moment death can take place. How you'll protect yourself? Therefore we take protection of God. That ""God, You can kill me at any moment. You can save me also."" Therefore we are intelligent. But you cannot protect from the onslaught of God. We admit God is great, but you do not, although you will not be protected. You cannot protect yourself from birth, death, old age and disease. So what is the meaning of your protection?"
Brahmānanda,"So both the devotee and the nondevotee, they are both in the same position. They both...",Prabhupāda,"They... And the devotees know that we are under the control of the Supreme, but you do not know. You are cats and dogs, and the dogs do not know, the cats do not know, you do not know. Therefore you are no better than the cats and dogs. And we know that there is God; there is controller. Therefore we are not cats and dogs. We are equal to the cats and dogs. You do not know; therefore you remain cats and dogs. We know."
Brahmānanda,What is the harm of being a cat or a dog?,Prabhupāda,"That is later on. First of all you do not know; we know. That is the difference. If somebody knows there is government, he is better than the outlaws who don't, doesn't care for the government. He is better position, a good citizen. Who accepts that there is government is good citizen. And one who doesn't care for the government, does whimsically everything, he becomes criminal. And then he is punished. That is the difference."
Brahmānanda,So if we all became devotees there would be no punishment.,Prabhupāda,"No. He'll be protected.Kṛṣṇasays,ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi[Bg.18.66]."

Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):Śrīla Prabhupāda, you were speaking ofanarthasand one of the lesser age boys was wondering... He's asking why we shouldn't take tea.",Prabhupāda,"Because intoxication. You become addicted. You are asking because you cannot give up tea. Therefore you are asking. Therefore it should be given up. You become servant of tea. Otherwise there is no question of asking. His asking means you want to drink. That means he has become servant of tea. Our original position—we are servant of God. So we are going to be servant of God. So if we remain servant of this material world, we cannot become servant of God. [break] ...unnecessary are advertised and people become victimized."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:...because they are envious. When they advertise all kinds of nonsense they don't mind getting cheated. But something nice, they are envious of it.",Prabhupāda,"Acchaboletomarelagdha,sutajagatmurare.(?) You give me thatchewraand milk and banana, nothing else. [break] ...and so much useless labor for growing tea, that will be stopped. You can grow food. [break] You drink tea, you'll require sugar. Then unnecessarily producing so much sugarcane. And the by-product of sugarcane, molasses, you'll have to utilize. Then produce wine, liquor. One after another."
Indian man (3):,Indian man (3):But our country depends upon sugar.,Prabhupāda,"No, that is mistake. Your country, you can produce your own food. That's all. Why you should depend? You produce food grains. You produce milk. Then your all necessities is supplied. Why should you produce unnecessarily?"
Brahmānanda,Here they use powdered milk because they have no cows.,Prabhupāda,"Just see. And here even by this sugarcane, what is called? Upper part? This part?"
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):We call itag.(?),Prabhupāda,"Ag,yes. You can maintain thousand of cows."
Indian man (1):,"Indian man (1):But that's actually best food, you know. In Punjab they use that. They store it for a year.",Prabhupāda,But you do not know how to be happy.
Indian man (1):,"Indian man (1):Even this land, here they are producing sugarcane. So that is strong for wheat. They can grow plenty of wheat.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Everything can be grown."
Indian man (1):,"Indian man (1):Because they don't want to do anything, they simply plant the sugarcane and then they want rest for few months, simply getting money and taking and drinking.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Indian man (1):,Indian man (1):No work. [break],Prabhupāda,"...getting rice, wheat from outside, they can charge any price because the price of grain is increasing."
Indian man (1):,"Indian man (1):Any time, they can stop it.",Prabhupāda,"You can stop it. (end) So thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement means we are trying to eradicate this conception of life, bodily conception of life. The animals... An animal, he is also thinking, ""I am dog,"" ""I am cat,"" ""I am cow,"" ""I am ass,"" on account of this bodily concept of life. And if we human beings, we also remain in that bodily concept of life, then we are no better than the animals. So if we remain animals, there cannot be any peace. You bring a dozens of dogs, and if you keep them, they cannot be improved. They will remain as animal. They have no capacity. And if you ask them to live peacefully, it is not possible, because they are animals. Similarly, if we human beings, although we are not animals, but we are not being educated as human being, and therefore we remain as animal, so how there can be any peace? The animal eats; we eat. The animal sleeps; we sleep. The animals have sex life; we have got sex life. The animal defends; we also defend. So if we remain engaged only on the principles of four demands of body, then we remain animal. Our extra education requires that ""I am not this body; I am spirit soul."" And there is necessity of the soul. If we don't come to this platform, then we remain animals. So thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement means we are trying to bring human being to the platform of spiritual consciousness or real human being."
Guest (1) (Indian man):,Guest (1) (Indian man):Are you striving for peace in the world? Is it one of your goals?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Everyone is trying for peace in the world. I have already referred to the United Nations organization. They are also trying peace of the world. But one must know the right way how to bring peace in the world. So our proposition is that if you keep the human being as good as animal, then how there can be peace? There cannot be any peace among animal society. (aside:)Aiye.Let him...Jaya.This is our proposal. So we are bringing these Europeans, Americans, Africans, Canadians, Australians to this platform of understanding, that ""We are human being; we are not animals."" The... First I have already explained. So long we shall remain in the bodily concept of life, then we remain animal."
Guest (2) (Indian man):,Guest (2) (Indian man):What was the necessity of creating thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement?,Prabhupāda,"Necessity is that the human form of life is meant for advanced education. Unfortunately, they are being educated to live like animals. That is the mistake. So we want to correct this mistake."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):But the spiritual organizations in India, all the spiritual teachings in India, have always put great emphasis on the fact that we are spiritual beings. So what was the necessity of creating another movement to say the same things?",Prabhupāda,"No. We are... You have brought in the question of India. We are talking of the human society, so why you are bringing India? We are not talking about India only. Human being does not mean only Indian. You see, human being—all, outside India, inside India, everywhere. Wherever there is human being, they require this education. And it is the India's duty. Because India has got the opportunity to be spiritually advanced by the grace of learned, saintly persons, so they should first of all make their life perfect by taking education and distribute the knowledge throughout the whole world. That is India's mission. That isCaitanyaMahāprabhu's mission, that... The exact word is Anyone who has taken birth in India as human being, he should first of all make his life perfect and... [break] ...no customer is coming, we go to sell our books. Yes."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Have you had a significant impact on the American society?,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Brahmānanda,"Well, not unless they follow our movement. But those who have followed our movement... Recently there was one study that was published by a very eminent sociologist in America from the University of California, the (sic:) Union Theological Center, and he stated in that book that the members of this movement, formerly they were drug-addicted hippies, and now they have become servants ofKṛṣṇaand humanity, loving servants. So he has given proof through intensive interviews that one who follows and joins this movement, dramatically his life becomes changed.",Prabhupāda,"Perfect. He is a big professor, and his books are being sold in higher circles. Professor Judah. And he has studied this movement for five years. And... You have got that book?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Show him. So they are appreciating. Appreciation has begun. Formerly they thought it is another edition of hippie movement, but now they are realizing it is not. A cultural. He has given the name of the book,HareKṛṣṇaand Counterculture.He is selling at the cost of twelve dollars; still, all high class, educated class, are purchasing."
Guest (3) (Indian man):,Guest (3) (Indian man):Have you any program for the common people?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Common people have joined. Everyone. We are opening centers so that any common man from anycaste, any creed, any nation, they can come and join."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):My friend, perhaps you would like to do... I know you are doing some social work for...",Prabhupāda,"This is the best social work. We are making animal into man. Already I have begun this, that because they are not educated how to become human being, so they remain animals. So this is the best social work, that we are bringing animals, two-legged animals, to real human being. If a human being is not properly educated, he remains an animal. So this is the proper education. Therefore we are bringing animals to human being."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Has your movement arranged once any particular event which is a movement in a particular country?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. When we are many in number, then we shall take politics also. Yes. First of all let there be perfect men. If there is no perfect men, the government will be imperfect. If there is perfect men, the government will be perfect."
Guest (4) (Indian man):,"Guest (4) (Indian man):Do you think, Swamiji, that man can become perfect?",Prabhupāda,"That is the chance of a human being. Therefore in the human society there is school, college, education, culture, not in the animal society, because they can be made into perfect, not the animals. So if they are denied proper education, that is the greatest harm. They got the opportunity, and the authorities are not giving them their opportunity."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):No, but do you mean the perfectness is to become God or to become the man? Then I want...",Prabhupāda,You never become God.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):What does perfectness mean?,Prabhupāda,Perfect means to become godly.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Can you be interested directly in politics?,Prabhupāda,"Why not?Kṛṣṇa...Kṛṣṇawas in politics. So He instructedArjunato fight. This is politic—for a good cause. WhenArjunadenied that ""Kṛṣṇa, I am not willing to kill my, the other side, my brothers and my uncles,"" He chastised him thatkutastvākaśmalamidaṁviṣamesamupasthitam:""How you are talking like non-Aryan? What is this nonsense?"" He...Kutastvā.First of all... Find out. Anārya.Anārya. He has saidanārya.Āryameans advanced.Anāryameans less advanced. Find out."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Chapter Two,Bhagavad-gītā,text two:",Prabhupāda,"""The Supreme Person,Bhagavān, said: My dearArjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy."" And purport?"
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Purport. ""Kṛṣṇa and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore LordKṛṣṇais referred to asBhagavānthroughout theGītā.Bhagavānis the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namelyBrahman, or the impersonal, all-pervasive spirit;Paramātmā, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; andBhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, LordKṛṣṇa. In theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:",Prabhupāda,"'The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed asBrahman,Paramātmā, andBhagavān.' (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,First Canto, Second Chapter, eleventh verse.) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun's surface and the sun planet itself. One who understands the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun's surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine, its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature may be compared to those who can realize only theBrahmanfeature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of theParamātmāfeature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore thebhaktas,or the transcendentalists who have realized theBhagavānfeature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category. The Sanskrit wordbhagavānis explained by the great authorityParāśaraMuni, the father of Vyāsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is calledBhagavān. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. OnlyKṛṣṇacan claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, includingBrahmā, Lord Śiva orNārāyaṇa, can possess opulences as fully asKṛṣṇa. Therefore it is concluded in theBrahma-saṁhitāby LordBrahmāhimself that LordKṛṣṇais the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, orBhagavān, known asGovinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes. 'There are many personalities possessing the qualities ofBhagavān, butKṛṣṇais the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval LordGovindaand the cause of all causes.' (Bs.Fifth Chapter, first verse.) In theBhāgavatamalso there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, butKṛṣṇais described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand: 'All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, butKṛṣṇais the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.' (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,First Canto, Third Chapter, twenty-eighth verse.) ThereforeKṛṣṇais the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the AbssPURolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonalBrahman. In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna's lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and thereforeKṛṣṇaexpressed His surprise with the wordkutas,'wherefrom.' Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Aryans. The wordāryais applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth,ViṣṇuorBhagavān, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Aryans. AlthoughArjunawas akṣatriya,he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Aryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. LordKṛṣṇadid not approve of the so-called compassion ofArjunafor his kinsmen."" So this movement is to make the people Aryan."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Telling... (microphone moving) Let's say, people who fight for their rights, the blacks in the United States or...",Prabhupāda,"...for thekṣatriya?Kṣatriyameans one who gives protection from being hurt,kṣat. Kṣatmeans hurting. So suppose if I unnecessarily hurt you, then it is the duty of the government to give you protection. So unless I am also punished by violence, I cannot..., He cannot give you protection. So this is also necessary. Therefore in the society there must bekṣatriya.Thebrāhmaṇasshould be learned; they should give instruction, advice. Thekṣatriyasshould give protection; thevaiśyasshould produce, economic development; and rest, they should assist-śūdras,that's all. This is the program of Aryan society."
Brahmānanda,Here in the evenings.,Prabhupāda,"Actually I want to speak only to the intelligent... [break] ...the common mass, they will not understand. But we can performkīrtanafor the common men, so that they may be purified."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Excuse me. I mean in your presence there must be some program likekīrtanaor...,Prabhupāda,"Anyway, this idea of society, of your culture, general mass of people, especially nowadays, it is very difficult. So if the leaders understand-yadyadācaratiśreṣṭhaḥ[Bg.3.21]—then the common mass will follow."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Yes, but here in Mauritius, most of the people are of Indian origin. It is easy for them to understandKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore I say the Indian, the leading Indians here, if they make a program, the common will follow. And everything is described in theBhagavad-gītā,how society should be conducted."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):But I think, Swamiji, common men follow only swamis, not the leaders or the priests.",Prabhupāda,"The idea is: the common men, they expect something, especially Indians, that India has got some spiritual culture. So every human being is seeking after spiritual culture, but unfortunately, at the present moment they are doing something which is not very desirable, the so-called swamis and yogis. I do not wish to describe them."
Brahmānanda,"The shaving of the head is a sign of surrender to the spiritual master, and we leave theśikhā...",Prabhupāda,"And keep the head light instead of unnecessarily burdened. In theKali-yugathere is a symptom. It is stated in the...Lāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam:""In theKali-yugapeople will think by keeping long hairs he has become beautiful."" This is the mentality of this age.Lāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam.You can write this.Lāvaṇyammeans luster, andkeśa-dhāraṇammeans keeping hair."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):By preachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness would you condemn other people's beliefs?,Prabhupāda,"We must condemn anyone who is notKṛṣṇaconscious. We say... I don't condemn;Kṛṣṇacondemns. Duṣkṛtinaḥmeans sinful; andmūḍhāḥmeans rascals, asses; andnarādhamāḥmeans lowest of the mankind; andmāyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥmeans their knowledge has been taken bymāyā; andāsuraṁbhāvamāśritāḥmeans atheist class. So this class of men will never surrender toKṛṣṇa. So if one is not surrendered toKṛṣṇa, we immediately take them either of these:duṣkṛtina,mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.This is our stand."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):No, suppose someone follower of... (loud static)",Prabhupāda,But he does not know who is the Supreme God.
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):But Swamiji, Indian culture, although is (Hindi). Then why you are telling a king...",Prabhupāda,"Indian culture is given (Hindi), that to allow them to worship the demigods means at least to accept the authority, and then they gradually come to the supreme authority. Just like for the common man, to give respect to the police constable means giving respect to the government. But the police constable is not the president of the government. So one should know who is the president. That is advancement. If you remain, simply offering respect to the constable, that is not advancement."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Indian philosophy has always taught that light comes from many lamps. But you are preaching that...,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Guest (4):,Guest (4):But you are preaching... (loud static),Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is the supreme light. There are degrees of light. There is sunlight, and there is this light. You cannot compare this light with sun. (laughter) Light are so many, but that does not mean the sunlight and this light is the same."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):No, what I...",Prabhupāda,First of all you understand this. You have questioned about the light. First of all you understand there are degrees of light. You cannot say this light and the sunlight is the same.
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):By this, you mean that those who adopt the teachings coming from the Koran or from the Bible is lesser light than from theGītā?",Prabhupāda,"That is your business. That is your business. But we give you the idea that light comes from everywhere. There is one glowworm. That light also light, and the sunlight is also light. You cannot think that the glowworm's light and the sunlight is the same. Now it is your business to see which is glowworm light and which is sunlight. That is your business."
Brahmānanda,He said that there is some allegation that our movement is connected with certain imperialistic countries.,Prabhupāda,"Let them say all nonsense. What can I do? Every nonsense will speak something nonsense. How can I check it? There are so many nonsenses, and therefore we are trying to make all these nonsense into human beings. That is our program. So long he is a nonsense, he will go on speaking nonsense. What can I do?"
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Swamiji, one thing I want to know. Thisśloka,from where you have got it, thisśloka, lāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam? Thisśloka, lāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. It is in the third chapter of Twelfth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Have you got ourBhāgavata,Twelfth Canto?"

You can get raincoat, you can get umbrella. Then you will... [break] So you cannot stop the rainy season, but you can protect yourself. [break] ...so many Africans. We have many Africans, devotees."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Yes. Americans.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Have you got any picture?
Brahmānanda,"If you come this evening, we have a nice film about our movement all over the world.",Prabhupāda,Yes. We go interior to African village.
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Swamiji, can I ask a question? How old are you, or, maybe I should say, how young are you?",Prabhupāda,Eighty years old. Eighty.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Here is one black American, asannyāsīin the renounced order of life. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...the bodily concept of life, he is no more African, no more American. He is spirit soul. [break]"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):...Swamiji, a very personal question. How would you react when people give you a godly reception?",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Brahmānanda,"He asks, ""When you get a godly reception, when you come to a place, how does your..., receive it?""",Prabhupāda,"Because I am representative of God, therefore they must give me godly reception. It is reception to God. Just like if you receive one ambassador from a country, then that means giving honor to that country. It is not my personal reception; it is acknowledging the glories of the Lord.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādaḥ**.It is said, ""If you please God's representative, then God is pleased."""
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Thank you, Swamiji.",Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇa. (end) ...that I shall be happy in this material world, he'll not be able to takeKṛṣṇaconsciousness.HareKṛṣṇa."
Cyavana,The slightest tinge of a material desire will force him to take another body. Is that it?,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Kṛṣṇawill give him full advantage of enjoying this material world. Unless he is disgusted, he cannot. He'll not become disgusted. ThereforeKṛṣṇasays, ""Give up this."" Personally, he is not going to be disgusted.māyā.ThereforeKṛṣṇapersonally asks him, ""Give up this business.""Sarva-dharmānparityajya[Bg.18.66].But we are thinking, ""Eh! Why this man asking like this?Sarva-dharmānparityajya.I shall give up my business, I shall give up my family, I shall give up my country and simply surrender to Him? Oh, it is too much. Sophisticated."" What is called? ""Sophistry."" What is sophistry?"
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Sophistry?,Prabhupāda,Yes?
Brahmānanda,Sophistry means some...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,... philosophy that is not sound. Superficial.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is... That is the remark of Dr. Rādhākrishnan, whenKṛṣṇasaid like that. That means ""He... Too much,"" because he thinks, ""Kṛṣṇa is..., may be a very big man, but He's a man. Why He is asking like that?"" [break] ...first business is to give him always miseries so that he may be disgusted. But he is so foolish, he is not becoming disgusted. Everyone knows this is very troublesome world, but nobody is disgusted."
Cyavana,"He's like the horse who chases after the carrot. He never gets it, but still, he keeps trying for it. He never gives up. He keeps trying.",Prabhupāda,"There are many examples.Matirnakṛṣṇeparataḥsvatovā.Only for this fault,gṛha-vratānām—""I shall be happy in this material world."" In Delhi, we established that center. You had been there?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Ananda...
Brahmānanda,AnandaNiketan.,Prabhupāda,Full of foreign embassies. So nobody came.
Brahmānanda,"They came the first night, and that was it.",Prabhupāda,Nobody came.
Brahmānanda,Neither were they very friendly.,Prabhupāda,"They thought that ""We are living so nicely, embassy and ambassador, and living in such a nice house, comfortably. What is this nonsense, God?"" All these embassies and the ambassadors, they are prized post. It has no use."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:They're what, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,"Prized post only. Governors, the embassies, this is... These are invented to satisfy the agitators, politicians, because the opposite party will agitate."
Brahmānanda,So give them some house and some post.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Give them some. That's all. It has no use. They do not do anything. Simply hold that post and get nice house, nice salary, servants, honor, and sometimes they are called and make some speech. That's all. And whatever nonsense he may be, if he is governor, then everyone will respect him. That's all. And as soon as the same man is not governor, nobody goes to kick on his face. I have seen so many governors. When they retire, nobody... (aside:) Where is that cap? Nobody cares."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Is this desire for material happiness the cause of material attachment?,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Kṛṣṇabhuliyajīvabhogavā&#241chākare.When they forget to serveKṛṣṇaand wants to enjoy this material world... Don't you see that theseMāyāvādīphilosophers are trying for liberation, and still, they are expecting to become God. That is another desire.Daridra-nārāyaṇa.The high ambition, to become God or equal to God, that is going on, struggle for existence."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:What about these rascals like Sai Baba? They use Kṛṣṇa's philosophy, and then they twist it in such a way that it becomesMāyāvāda.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. He's a cheater. People want to be cheated. They come tosādhufor some material benefit. Don't you see that people are so much anxious to touch the feet of asādhu?What is the reason? Reason is that if he gets some favor of thesādhu,""Then I shall be happy materially."" That's all. They have no idea, becoming servant ofKṛṣṇa.Āśīrvāda(Hindi)."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:But if he's a realguru, then the real benefit will be there.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Harikeśa,"Do you want another cover, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,"No. This is all right. [break] ...the male, that one."
Brahmānanda,The red one?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is also male. [break] ...for their family.Gṛha-vratānām.Wife, children, they are also enjoying.Viṣayaḥkhalu...This wife and children and material happiness he will get in any form of life. So if the human life is also the same thing, then where is the benefit? But they are proud that ""The... They are loitering on the..., without any home. We have constructed this home. Therefore we are advanced."" This is their philosophy. The business is the same. ""That's all right. But we are improved."" This is advancement. Business is thepunaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30],the same sex, same eating, the same sleeping, same defending, but in an improved way. Even in the heavenly planet, wherever you go, the same thing, simply... Just like this country and Europe, the standard of living different, but the business is the same. And the... When they improve or so-call improve the standard of living, they think, ""Now we are advanced."" And what about your death? (aside:) Stop. The chicken is also dying; you are also dying. What is your improvement? That they cannot say. Real problem they cannot solve. Simply a little high standard of living, and they think this is advancement. And the Western civilization is influencing all other parts of the world in that way—""Improve the standard of living."" There is no improvement, but it ismāyā;they are thinking, ""This is improvement."""
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Progress.,Prabhupāda,"Progress, yes. The progress is that they have got motorcar, and they have progressed how to die quickly. This is the progress. At any moment he can die. As soon as he on the car, 70 miles speed, that means taking the risk of dying at any moment. This is the progress. Formerly people were going in bullock cart or horse carriage from one village to another. ""That was primitive. Now we can go hundred miles away from home for earning money and taking risk to die at any moment. That is progress."" Is it not?"
Brahmānanda,"Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Formerly they were satisfied by tilling the ground, getting food grains. Now they have started factories. At the cost of thousands of men's labor, some director is getting money and enjoying life. That is progress. And these rascals, laborers, they are thinking that ""These men are getting the profit, cream of this business. We are working. Why not take ourself?"" That is Communism."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:There is one small coal mining town we didsaṅkīrtanaat, an Indian community. And they were thinking that ""The coal mine is doing everything for us. They're giving us schools, they're giving us medicine, they're giving us... Without the coal mine where would we be?""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,Here they think it's sugarcane. The sugarcane is everything.,Prabhupāda,Giving everything.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Why can't people understand to depend onKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,There ismāyā.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Just like air that we breathe.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That ismāyā,no education. ThisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement means we are giving intelligence; therefore they are understanding. But there is no such propaganda. There was no such propaganda."
Brahmānanda,"One of those reporters yesterday was saying ""Well, there's so many philosophies from India. Why have you started this one?"" But actually no other philosophy has given this message.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore I said that ""Why you are bringing India? The whole world is in darkness."" (to passerby:)HareKṛṣṇa. Good morning."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:There's a verse in theBhāgavatam,Prabhupāda.Yenātmāsuprasīdati:""By rendering devotional service to the transcendental Lord, one becomes completely satisfied."" So what happens? These people in material life, they come to the temples and they chant a little bit. But they find that the standard of pure devotional service is so high that they're not able to grasp it. They don't feel the complete satisfaction. They're still attached to the material world.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is compared with the jaundice disease. Jaundice disease, for jaundice, sugarcane is the medicine. But they taste sugarcane as bitter. Sugarcane... One who is suffering in jaundice will taste sugarcane as bitter. That is the test. So that is the medicine. So he has to take the sugarcane. And by taking, when he is cured he will find, ""Oh, it is very sweet."""
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:So then he has to recognize there is some problem living in this material world.,Prabhupāda,No. He does not find any happiness on account of his too much materialistic mind.
Brahmānanda,That is the disease.,Prabhupāda,"That is the disease. So it has to be cured by thisbhakti-yoga.So in thebhakti-yoga,in the beginning, it will taste bitter. Therefore they do not come. But if they take tobhakti-yoga,then the material disease will be cured and they will find it is very sweet."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yes. So the more people try to enjoy materially, they become more and more unhappy.",Prabhupāda,"We are in the material world means everyone is diseased. [break]māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ,duṣkṛtinaḥ[Bg.7.15].This is described. This is the material disease. I explained how they are committing sinful life: slaughterhouse, this liquor house and so many things, simply sinful. And they do not know they are going to suffer again in another body. He's going to be slaughtered next life. ""Life for life."" You are taking life, so many lives; you have to give so many times life. Take birth and become killed. Take birth and become killed."" There is no knowledge."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Sometimes people ask, Prabhupāda, that if one falls down into lower species of life like plants or animals, how then do they come again to the human form of life?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is nature's way. Give them again chance to develop. From trees they become flies. That is the beginning of movement. Then from flies to birds, birds to beast, and beast to animal, er, human being. This is great chastisement. You cannot move even. Suffer torrents of rain, cyclone, scorching heat, pinching cold. Stand up for hundreds and thousands of years. Then, when the punishment is finished, then he becomes moving. If there is scorching heat he can move to some shelter. But he cannot move. They do not study all this science, why there are so many varieties of life, of different grades. Wherefrom they are coming?"
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:The living entity, then, in the tree is actually conscious of its condition of life.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:The living entity inside the tree is actually conscious of its condition of life.,Prabhupāda,"Not advanced consciousness, but he is conscious. He feels. He feels."
Harikeśa,"It shocked a lot of people when they made the test of bringing a scissor to a plant, and they put some electrodes on it and they found that the plant was reacting with fear.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. That machine has been discovered by Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose. He discovered this wireless telegram, radio. But Marconi took from him, and British government helped him."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:The British again.,Prabhupāda,"Britishers were advertising outside India that ""Indians are uncivilized. Therefore we are making them civilized. Therefore we should stay there. Don't object."" Because United Nations, they were asking, ""Why you are occupying India?"" So they used to forward this argument, that ""These people are uncivilized. We are making them civilized."" (laughter) Now, how there should be Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose? Therefore they used to suppress always. Everything Indian wanted to do, they would suppress: big businesses, this mining... They would suppress. This Morarji, Sumati Morarji, her father-in-law started that... He had to face so many impediments from the Britishers to start the shipping company. Formerly there was no shipping company, Indian. Now, before that, there was shipping, not shipping company, but navigation was there from India toRome, Greece, Turkey, there was regular business of spices and fine cloth. Later on, this large-scale shipping industry, that was done by the Europeans. So when Indian wanted to start, they would supress. TheTatairon industry, he had to face so many difficulties. Formerly, even if you wanted to bring some iron frame, it would come from Sheffield."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:From where?,Prabhupāda,Sheffield.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Oh, England.",Prabhupāda,"England. So everything Indian required, they would supply, and they would govern and they would exploit. Therefore they became so rich—simply by exploiting India. And Indian soldiers, they expanded empire-Africa, Burma. That's all, all Indian exploitation, Indian men, money, and exploitation. As soon as they lost India, they lost whole empire."
Cyavana,Now they are also suffering.,Prabhupāda,"Eh? That... That must be. They will be suffering more and more. They will be beggars. They have done so much sinful activities for expanding their empire. Now they will have to become beggars. And within two hundred years, everything finished. They started their exploitation from seventeenth, eighteenth century. And in the twentieth century, everything finished. The French people and the English people... This is also one of the examples. Both the nations came here to exploit. That was the competition in... The French people and the English people, they would go for colonization, fight, and establi... America was also that, Canada, everywhere. But because they were their own men, they were given dominion status. Almost free."
Brahmānanda,At one time all of Africa was controlled by the European nations. Completely.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Mainly these French and...
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:In South Africa, the British also tried to take over South Africa. There was a war called the Boer War.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:So during World War I and World War II many of the South Africans, they actually sided with the Germans because they were against the English so much.",Prabhupāda,African means black Africans. No?
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:No. South Africans, they were Europeans. The British started the first concentration camp. They took these ""Afrikaners"" as they call them, Europeans. They put them on an island called St. Helena. That was actually the first concentration camp, by the British.",Prabhupāda,"This is going on. Still, even the opposite party, they are not disgusted—""This material life is not very peaceful."" They are not disgusted."
Brahmānanda,"Now they are thinking, ""We'll be independent...""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That... They are trying to be independent. And India... Just like India has got independent, and now the position is ""emergency."" They do not think in this way, that ""Independence or dependence, we are actually dependent under the laws of nature."" That they do not think. They are thinking... The same example as I gave, that ""This boil is here. Why not here? It is very painful,"" like that. They have no sense that so-called dependence or independence, he has to suffer. That he does not know.Mūḍhanābhijānāti."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:In theBhagavad-gītāKṛṣṇaexplains,vāsudevasarvamiti,that He is everything and that He is everywhere.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:So this verse,mūḍho 'ya nābhijānāti,that themūḍhas,they can't perceiveKṛṣṇa. So actually it's simply that we're covered, isn't it? ButKṛṣṇais always there.",Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇais always there, butyogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ.He does not knowKṛṣṇaon account of being covered by the curtain ofyogamāyā. Nāhaṁprakāśaḥsarvasyayogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ[Bg.7.25].But we can make them all happy byKṛṣṇaconsciousness, if they follow our instruction, even in this material world.Pūrṇaṁsukhāyate.Full happiness we can give them if they follow our principle."
Cyavana,They have so many doubts.,Prabhupāda,"What is the doubt? Doubt means they cannot drink, they cannot continue slaughterhouse, they cannot continue brothels. That's all. This is their doubt, that ""How these things will be maintained? This is our life."" That is doubt, and that is the difficulty. As soon as we say, ""No this,"" oh, they are in danger. Even Marquis of Zetland, ""Oh, it is impossible to give up. This is our life."" There is the difficulty. Otherwise, there is no difficulty. They cannot think of, especially the Westerners, that without these things one can live. So many, our disciples, left. Rāyarāma left: ""Oh, Swamiji is denying the preliminary necessities of life."" This is the preliminary necessities of life: illicit sex, meat-eating, drinking, gambling. They cannot think that a man can live without these things. Therefore people are wonderful, that ""How he is turning these Europeans, Americans to this standard?"" That is their wonder. Nobody can think of, that these things can be given up and one can avoid it. It is dream. Your government, American government, is also surprised that ""We have spent so much money for stopping this LSD, and this man by saying his disciples, they are giving up."" Judah has also mentioned that. That is their surprise—""How these things can be given up? It is impossible."""
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:You once said in Geneva that no one has died by giving up smoking.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Actually that is the fact. You have given up these four bad things, and what is your wrong, harm? Rather, you have become bright-faced. But they will not give it up. They think, ""It is impossible."""
Brahmānanda,"They say we have just undergone some religious conversion and become fanatical, and therefore we have given up.",Prabhupāda,"No, why don't you become fanatical? (laughter)"
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Although it says in theBibleeven that one should praise the Lord's name with cymbals and drums...,Prabhupāda,"They have no concern withBibleand God and everything. They are simply after sense gratification. What is the use of quoting aboutBible?They don't care forBible.The Europeans, Americans, they have rejected, thrown away, kicked outBiblebecause (it is) unscientific. Actually they do not accept. Although they call themselves Christian, they do not accept anything ofBible.That is...Bibleis finished. There is no meaning ofBible.Simply for their sectarian prestige, they say""Bible.""But actually they have nothing to do withBible.What do you think?"
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yes, it's true.",Prabhupāda,"They do not go to the church, but they come to us for arguing withBible.Just see. What is the meaning? Their churches have closed, nobody goes, and they come to argue with us withBible.That means ""The Devil cites scripture."" They are devils, and they are quoting fromBible."
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):So many people who come to our program, they are Christians. There may be 75% who come. They are all Christians.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. We don't discriminate whether he is Christian. We take everyone as human being, welcome. So what do they say? They also quoteBible?"
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):They say that their priests tell them, ""You just listen to me and forget about theBible.""",Prabhupāda,"And who are you? Then I can say also, ""You hear me. Forget aboutBible."" Anyone can say. Why the priest? Wherefrom the priest has come? Has he dropped from the sky? (laughter) That's it. Everyone can say, ""My dear priest, you hear me. Don't talk of yourself. You hear me."" Everyone can say. Then? How things will be adjusted? The priest is also a man; I am also man. If he can say like that, I can say like that. Then who will make adjustment? Who is correct? Hm? How it will be adjusted? If everyone will propose something, and who will say, ""Now, out of so many proposals, this is correct."" That means chaotic condition. If everyone says, ""What I say, you hear."" Then who will hear? Everyone will say only. Who will hear? That is going on actually. And rascal Vivekananda says, ""Everyone's opinion is good."""
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yathāmattathāpath.,Prabhupāda,"Yathāmattathāpath.This is going on. Everyone will say something, and it is all right. However nonsense it may be, it is all right. EvenGandhifollowed that philosophy. Therefore he invented one, another philosophy, nonviolence, which is impossible. When Hindus approached him, that ""You have got so much influence over the Mohammedans, so why not stop cow killing?"" he said, ""It is their religious principle. How can I interfere?"" Just see."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya.Kṛṣṇaorders inBhagavad-gītā, go-rakṣya.",Prabhupāda,"And he is considered to be a great scholar inBhagavad-gītā,and when cow protection was requested, he said that ""How can I do it? It is their religious principle."" And he is a great big scholar inBhagavad-gītā.All nonsense, going on. Whole world is full of nonsense,mūḍhas,beginning fromGandhito any rascal, all of them, rascals. Perhaps it is the first time we are detecting, ""Here are all rascals."" It is first time. Then we are enemy of everyone. We call everyone rascal-Gandhirascal, Vivekananda rascal, Aurobindo rascal. So actually they are, but people are thinking, ""These people say all big, big men rascals? Therefore they are rascals."""
Cyavana,The average man doesn't have the intelligence to discriminate between an intelligent man and a fool. He will listen to anyone.,Prabhupāda,"No, we have got this from the standard test tube,Kṛṣṇa. Anyone who is notKṛṣṇaconscious, he isduṣkṛtina,mūḍha.That's all. We have no difficulty. Just like that urine test? We have got... One who has got that testing paper, red, yellow and so on, so on... So we have got this testing paper,Bhagavad-gītā."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:[break] Prabhupāda, Lord Caitanya's weapons were His associates. LordCaitanyaMahāprabhu's weapons were His associates.",Prabhupāda,"Yes.Sāṅgopāngāstra-pārṣadam.Therefore NarottamadāsaṬhākura said,gaurāṅgerasaṅgi-gaṇe,nitya-siddhakorimāne:""All the associates of LordCaitanya, they are ever liberated.""Nitya-siddhakorimāne.""Anyone accepts the assistants of LordCaitanyaas ever liberated—he also becomes liberated, simply by accepting the associates of LordCaitanyaMahāprabhuwho is helpingCaitanyaMahāprabhu's mission, simply by accepting this, the man who is accepting, he becomes liberated.""Sejāy brajendra-nandapāś.Gaurāṅgerasaṅgi-gaṇe,nitya-siddhakorimāne,sejāy brajendra-nandapāś."
Cyavana,This is the way to go up.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. [break] ...this is a fact, that ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness is the topmostyoga, and preach it. This is a fact. Except we,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, nobody knows anything—allmūḍhas.Any association, any religion—allmūḍhas.But you must prove yourself. Otherwise it will be bigotry. If you simply say that ""We are only first class"" without any knowledge... You have to defend yourself. There will be so many opposing elements. Then you become first class. Your position is first class, but you have to maintain it. Otherwise, they will say ""religious fanatics."" Any opposition party, you have to meet. That is required."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Would you like to sit for some time here, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,No. [break]
Harikeśa,Don't bring milk when water is required. You have given the example.,Prabhupāda,Don't bring milk?
Devotees:,Devotees:When water is required.,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:No, no. No, I wasn't. I was thinking of Prabhupāda's satisfaction. You're thinking what I'm thinking...",Prabhupāda,"You are right. He was right. That is service. Before wanting, that is... That is all right. ""Now let the master refuse it."" But service is: before he asks, the thing should be offered. That is service. After asking, offering something, that is second-class service. First-class service, before he wants, ""Here is the thing, ready."" That is first-class service. Now it is his liking. He may not like that. He may ask something else. But the service must be offered. And your example, milk and water, is not applicable here. I did not ask him either milk or water. (laughter) So your example is futile."
Cyavana,Perfect.,Prabhupāda,So don't be discouraged.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:No, Prabhupāda. I'll never leave your lotus feet. They asked you about other movements yesterday at the press conference...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:...this movement and that movement. You said, ""This is Kṛṣṇa's movement."" So this should be our line of argument, because especially amongst the Indian community, when they question us about this swami and that swami...",Prabhupāda,"They replied that in everything there is light. And yes, the light of, what is called, glowworm and the light of sun is not the same. Everything is light; that doesn't... We haven't got to accept so-called lights. Even there is light, when there is sunlight, why you should aspire after glow of light? (People chanting in background) Who is chantingHareKṛṣṇa?"
Cyavana,Everyone is sayingHareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,HareRāmaHareRāma. (laughter)
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):So all those sinful activities of these people have been eradicted now by sayingHareRāma?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Immediately. That is the special advantage of this age.Kirtanādevakṛṣṇasyamukta-saṅgaḥ[SB12.3.51].Immediately becomes free,mukta-saṅga.Without becomingmukta-saṅga,they cannot chant even. Why others are not chanting, they are chanting?"
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):But the same... That means they will make more sinful activities?,Prabhupāda,"If he does, that is another thing. Otherwise, for the time being, he is freed from all the reaction of sinful, immediately.Sadyaḥsavanāyakalpate. Sadya,immediately. Immediately he becomesbrāhmaṇa."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Is pious activity on the material platform?,Prabhupāda,"No, no. It is transcendental, above pious activity. By accumulation of pious activities one may be elevated to the transcendental position.Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ[SB10.12.11].Puṇyameans pious activities. After doing for many, many years simply pious activities one may be elevated to the transcendental platform. So pious activities cannot be compared with transcendental activities. But it may help in the long run. Therefore transcendental activities does not depend on pious activity. It is not dependent. Then it will take long, long years. But automatically he becomes pious, achieves the result of pious activities."
Cyavana,"[break] ...the standard of morality, Arjuna's activity of killing was immoral.",Prabhupāda,"Morality, immorality, this is all creation of mind. Real purpose of life, to serve the order ofKṛṣṇa, that is real morality."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:I think that we must all bekṛpa-siddhi,because by your mercy you have lifted us out of hellish conditions of life.",Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇa's mercy. You have accepted Kṛṣṇa's mercy. This is the... [break] This empirical policy was very good, provided it would have been done forKṛṣṇa. Then they could unite the whole world."
Brahmānanda,They had very good managing talent.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. But the whole thing was planned for their own sense gratification."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:If we ever had any kind of power like that and tried to do something like that, they would accuse that this is like the Crusades.",Prabhupāda,"Now, Crusades, even... If they could expand the ideas of Christian, love of Godhead, that was nice. But that was not the purpose. It is exploitation."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Even by force?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. By force if you give some good medicine, that is good for him. In my childhood I would not take medicine. Exactly like this, now also. (laughter) So I was given medicine by force in the spoon. Two men will catch me and my mother take me on the lap and then force and I shall take. I never agreed to take any medicine."
Harikeśa,"Should we do that now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,Then you'll kill me.
Harikeśa,You would not go to school either.,Prabhupāda,I don't like... Yes.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Lord <a href=""/d/ramacandra"" class=""d"">R&#257;macandra</a> worshiped His devotees. Just like sometimes <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> worships R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; and touched His feet..., Her feet. That does not mean that <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>... Just like <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was tolerating ear pulling by mother <a href=""/d/yasoda"" class=""d"">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a>. That does not mean that mother <a href=""/d/yasoda"" class=""d"">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> is the Supreme. Hm? <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was carrying the wooden shoes of <a href=""/d/nanda"" class=""d"">Nanda</a> <a href=""/d/maharaja"" class=""d"">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. So that does not mean <a href=""/d/nanda"" class=""d"">Nanda</a> <a href=""/d/maharaja"" class=""d"">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> is greater than <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. It is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's pleasure. Just like sometimes a father takes the son on the shoulder, carries. Does it mean the father is inferior than the son? So this is third-class man's conclusion. They do not know what is <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, what is <a href=""/d/rama"" class=""d"">R&#257;ma</a>. <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says that <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/aham"" class=""d"">aham</a> &#257;dir <a href=""/d/hi"" class=""d"">hi</a> <a href=""/d/devanam"" class=""d"">dev&#257;n&#257;m</a></span></I> [Bg </I><a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/10/2?d=1"">10.2</a></I>]<span class=""Italic""></I>.</span> So He is the origin of Lord &#346;iva. So how &#346;iva can be the Supreme? We have to consult <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a>.</span> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> does not say that &#346;iva is Supreme. So if a third-class man says &#346;iva is Supreme, we have to accept it? We are preaching <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. Whatever <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says, that is Supreme, not a third-class man's version. Is it clear? Yes. We should not take a third-class, fourth-class man's version. We should take from the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a>.</span></div>
