Nitāi,It's text 8.,Prabhupāda,Ah. What does it say?
Nitāi,It says:,Prabhupāda,Translation.
Nitāi,"""They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than lust.""",Prabhupāda,"They think, theasura,that is the distinction betweenasuraandsura.Theasurawill say, ""There is no control.""Anīśvaram. Īśvarammeans controller,anīśvarammeans without any controller. Then how it has come into existence, how it is working so nicely? So they answer it:kāma-haitukam.Kāma-haitukammeans just like a man and woman mix together, then there is sex desire and there is a production of child. There is no question of controlling. It is timely interaction of different elements. This is calledkāma-haitukam.So what is that other?Asatyam..."
Nitāi,Asatyamapratiṣṭham.,Prabhupāda,"And others, other atheist in the dress of very goodsannyāsī,they sayjagadmithyā,mithyā.But they say also,brahmasatya,they acceptBrahmān. They are not so atheist, at least they accept. Then?"
Nitāi,Jagad āhuranīśvaram[Bg.16.8].,Prabhupāda,"Ah,jagad āhuranīśvaram[Bg.16.8].There is no God, it has come automatically by interaction. But even it is so, how the interaction is taking place? That is intelligence. Interaction, just like acid and alkali. Just like oil and caustic soda. These are two chemicals and mixing them, interaction, the result is soap. Accepting this principle, but there must be a mixer, a person who is mixing. Otherwise, how the soap and oil is being mixed? The soap is there and the oil is there and the caustic soda is also there, that is material ingredient. But they are not coming together automatically. That is not possible. Where is the evidence? There are so many soap factories, and let them keep oil and caustic soda and there is no question of labor, let them become soap. Where is that evidence? But these rascals say like that.Aparasparasambhūtam.Interaction of the two things. But where is the interaction of two things unless it is arranged by some third element? Where is the evidence? So these are foolish theories, that there is no God, things are taking place automatically and things are coming out, these are all foolish theories. There is no evidence.Pramāṇa,there must be evidence. Otherwise... Just like science means simply not to see observation that things are taking place, but experiment. It must be substantiated by experiment. Just like theoretically everyone knows that two chemicals, soda and alkali, mixes together and there is interaction, effervescence. But who is mixing the soda and alkali, er, alkali and acid? There must be. Therefore the answer is there in theBhagavad-gītā, mayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsuyatesa-carācaram[Bg.9.10].""Under My superintendence."" That is God. Under God's superintendence things are coming.Parasyaśaktiḥvividhaivaśruyate.He has got many multi powers and energies, they are working. Just like in nowadays electronic. You type your ""a"" and thousand miles away another typewriter willstrikeimmediately ""a"", is it not? It is called, what is called?"
Paramahaṁsa,Telex.,Prabhupāda,Telex? Not telex. Telex is also on the same thing.
Devotees:,Devotees:Teletype.,Prabhupāda,"Teletype, yes. You push here ""a"" and the other end the ""a"" will immediatelystrike. There is no need of another person typing. But how it is being done? There is electronic arrangement by higher scientist. Not that, ordinary typewriter will not, no. Suppose if you keep one typewriter at your brother's place and you push it here, will itstrikethere? (laughter) Why? Because there is no arrangement. There is no arrangement. So these are common sense but the rascals will not understand. That without a touch of the living entity nothing can be done. The supreme living entity isKṛṣṇa. Therefore it is saidmayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsuyatesa-carācaram[Bg.9.10].""I am the cause of the material energy working.""Parasyaśaktiḥvividhaivaśruyate.There isparasyaśaktiḥ,now who can explain how this flower has come into existence? That is same thing. The energy ofKṛṣṇais working. Just like you want to paint one nice flower, so you have to take the brush and the color and you have to endeavor. Not that automatically coming, this beautiful flower. So how do you think this beautiful flower has come automatically? This is foolishness. There is also the brush, the paint, but it is so perfect that just like you cannot see how the other typewriter is striking. You cannot say it is automatically striking. There is arrangement. But this arrangement you do not understand. Therefore you are foolish, you are thinking that this typewriter is striking automatically. It is not automatically. Here the other typewriter it is stroken and there is electric arrangement and it is striking. So you have to understand like... That issura.Andasura,they will say, ""No, there is no God. It is taking automatically, it is going on,"" This is foolishness. Theasurameans foolish, first-class foolish, that's all. Why it has become so? That is explained here. That they do not know how to behave,nāpi cācāraḥ.Nasatyaṁteṣuvidyate,neither they know what is the actual truth. They are defective themself and they are explaining in the defective way that so many rascal chemists they say that the chemical evolution is the cause of life. What is this nonsense? Chemical evolution, you get the chemicals and make a experiment and produce life. Then your proposal is all right that by chemical evolution there is life. No, that is not possible. You have got all the chemicals. Why don't you revive a dead man by injecting chemicals again into life, where is your power? So why do you talk foolishly like that? This should be challenged that ""You are foolish number one."" Actually it so happened in California. One big chemist he came there to lecture the chemical evolution, by mixing of chemical life has come into existence. So there was one student, he is my disciple, Dr.SvarūpaDāmodara, he said that [break] ...first-class cheater, that's all,mūḍhā.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥprapadyantenarādhamāḥ[Bg.7.15].(indistinct) ...people are suffering for want of this knowledge. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, we are trying to bring people in true platform of knowledge, not to increase death like these rascals and fools. That is our proposal. They are trying to obstruct us because if everyone becomesKṛṣṇaconscious then they can't cheat anyone. NowAcyutānandaSwami, he went to some place, there was a bigsannyāsī,very well-knownsannyāsī.So he went to sell some books in theirāśramafirst of all. So one of his student, one of his disciple, he canvassedAcyutānanda, ""Why don't you ask some question to Swamiji?"" He clearly said, ""I have nothing to question from your Swamiji. I know better than him."" (laughter) So actually bring any so-called yogis, swamis or incarnation, our student will challenge him. He does not know anything. We have got such a nice book of knowledge,Bhagavad-gītā.By the arguments and proposition in theBhagavad-gītāwe can capture all these rascals and nonsense. All right? Yes, question is very good to understand clearly. (end)"
