Devotee:,Devotee:Nature's law?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, how the nature is working."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpa:It's working,mayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsuyatesa-carācaram[Bg.9.10].",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guru,Guru-kṛpa:Acting under Kṛṣṇa's...,Prabhupāda,"Under Kṛṣṇa's plan. Therefore you cannot violate Kṛṣṇa's law. As soon as you violate nature's law, then you have to be punished. (pause)"
Guru,"Guru-kṛpa:Bhagavad-gītā,thatprakṛteḥkriyamāṇāni...",Prabhupāda,"...guṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ[Bg.3.27].Yes, andprakṛtiis working under the direction ofKṛṣṇa. That means, nature's law means Kṛṣṇa's law or Kṛṣṇa's plan. So what is the Kṛṣṇa's plan? WhatKṛṣṇawants?"
Guru,"Guru-kṛpa:Kṛṣṇawants every living entity to come back to home, back to Godhead.",Prabhupāda,"Thank you. This is the plan. If this plan is not executed, then there is suffering. So this human life is given to the living entity for understanding this plan and do the needful. If they do not understand, then they are punished. [break]"
Guru,"Guru-kṛpa:...today is that because the people have never been given any information what Kṛṣṇa's plan is, either they're too old or too... They're attached. They can't understand anything. That's the majority of the people. Once they get past thirty years old, it's very difficult for them to accept something.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is not. Thirty, forty, fifty or one year, that doesn't matter. One can understand if he wants to understand.Ahaitukyapratihatā.It is not limited by any age. Otherwise howPrahlādaMahārājawas great devotee,DhruvaMahārājawas great devotee?"
Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:I think he just wants to mention that it is more difficult for people who are elderly to understand, those who are more set up in their ways.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. That is the difficulty. They are trained up in such a way that it's very difficult to forget what they have learned. ThereforePrahlādaMahārājasays,kaumāraacaretpraj&#241aḥ,from the very beginning of life one should learn this art of understandingKṛṣṇaand Kṛṣṇa's plan."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Śrīla Prabhupāda, usually onsaṅkīrtanaI avoid old people because they just don't understand, and it's very difficult to approach them.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes, yes. Old people should be instructed to forget what they have learned.Hesādhavaḥsakalamevavihāyadūrādcaitanya-candra-caraṇekurutānurāgam.This is the formula of preaching. PrabodhānandaSarasvatī, he is begging to the people,dāntenidhāyatṛṇakaṁ padayornipatyakāku-śataṁkṛtvācāhambravīmi:""Taking a straw in my mouth, with folded hands and flattering you hundred times, I am submitting one request."" ""What is that?"" This is the process of approaching these rascals, old fools who have learned something and does not like to forget. So he says,hesādhavaḥ:""Oh, you are such a nice learned scholar-devotee, so my request is that whatever you have learned, please forget.""Sakalamevavihāyadūrāt:""Kick them out."" ""Then? What shall I do?""Caitanya-candra-caraṇekurutānurāgam:""Please turn your attention to the teachings of LordCaitanya.""Hesādhavaḥsakalamevavihāya:""You are very great personality. So my request to you: you forget or kick out whatever you have learned."" That is the first business."
Guru,Guru-kṛpa:It is a very humble approach.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Humble approach for giving a slap, (chuckles) that ""You forget everything, what you have learned."" First of all, this is the first condition.Hesādhavaḥsakalamevavihāyadūrādcaitanya-candra-caraṇekurutānurāgam.We can go this way. This is our business. We know they are all rascals, but they are thinking that ""We know so many things. We are learned scholars."" So humbly approach them and flatter him that ""You are so nice man, such a learned scholar."" Just like a child is flattered, ""My dear boy, you are such a nice boy. You take these lozenges and return me the hundred dollar note. Don't spoil it. You are such a good boy, yes."" This is our... Therefore to approach these rascals we have to learntṛṇādapisunīcenatarorapisahiṣṇunā.That is the preaching method. Everyone is puffed up. Even most insignificant man, he is also puffed up: ""Oh, I am so rich man, I know everything. I have got so much bank balance. These poor fellows, they cannot earn livelihood; therefore they have become Vaiṣṇavas."" This is their policy. [break] You immediately print 100,000, that""Scientific Basis."""
Rāmeśvara,Immediately reprint.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Rāmeśvara,I am planning to do that as soon as I go back to Los Angeles. And Jayatīrtha said you want us to send these to the professors.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Rāmeśvara,Complimentary copies for them to study that another scientist has accepted your teachings.,Prabhupāda,"He has very nicely slapped Darwin. (chuckles) He is a mental speculator. How is that, the scientists accept a mental speculator's theory? (pause)"
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):What is it called?,Prabhupāda,Gandharvapur.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):What does it mean?,Prabhupāda,"Sometimes... Means this is false thing. It appears as a big city. Similarly, this is also. This material world is like that. It is a false cloud only, but we have taken it as fact. Just see, it appears just like big New York City. If you go to the forest, you will find some illusion, that just after that tree there is a big house. Have you experienced that?"
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"That is called Gandharvapur. So if anyone wants to enter that big city, then what is his position?"
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Illusion.,Prabhupāda,"The same thing: the conditioned soul enters the big city of material world, and he struggles. (pause)"
Rāmeśvara,"I have heard there is a philosophy here amongst some of the devotees that if you chantHareKṛṣṇa, you can go back to the spiritual world even if you do not give up your independence.",Prabhupāda,What is that?
Rāmeśvara,"Many devotees who have moved outside of the temple are feeling that if they just continue to chantHareKṛṣṇa, they can go back to the spiritual world, but they are not giving up their independence.",Prabhupāda,So? What is your philosophy?
Rāmeśvara,"Well, it seems somewhat hypocritical because chantingHareKṛṣṇameans you are praying toKṛṣṇato please be engaged eternally in His service and to become completely dependent on Him. So we try to explain like that. And to follow all the teachings and instructions, attendingmaṅgalaāratikand morning and evening class.",Prabhupāda,So they are doing that or not?
Guru,Guru-kṛpa:No. They are not even following regulative principles.,Prabhupāda,Then?
Rāmeśvara,"They think just by chanting, they will go back to the spiritual world. That is enough.",Prabhupāda,"Then what is the meaning of the ten kinds of offenses? If he is chanting without offense, then it is all right, but if he is committing offenses, it will not be effective. There are ten kinds of offenses. Whether he is strictly offenseless? Then it is all right. If he is offender, then it will not be fruitful. It will be fruitful; it will take long time because first of all you have to become offenseless. Then you will be admitted. (aside:) Don't come very near. That's it. So they are committing offenses, so how they can become perfect? He is committing not following the rules and regulation. That means he is thinking that ""Whatever I do, it will be adjusted by chanting the name."" Is it not?"
Rāmeśvara,That is their philosophy.,Prabhupāda,"That is their philosophy. That is the greatest offense,nāmnad balādyasyahipāpa-buddhiḥ,that ""I can go on committing sinful activity, but by chantingHareKṛṣṇamantra,it will be adjusted."" That is the greatest offense. So explain to them."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpa:So they say, ""Then my chanting is useless? So I should stop?"" That's what they say.",Prabhupāda,"No, not useless. But just like if you kindle fire and at the same time pour water, it will take long time. To kindle fire, make it dry, keep it dry. Then it will be very quickly successful. So you are committing offenses, at the same time chanting, so by chanting effect, you will come to that stage, but it will take time. If you want to be transferred to the spiritual world quickly, just like if you want to ignite the fire very quickly, you must keep it dry. If you simply put on the wet wood, then the fire will not be very powerful. It will be... It will take time. The fire will be blazing fire. Then it will dry. It will take... Better put dry wood to make it successful. This is the process. The effect of chantingHareKṛṣṇawill not go in vain, but it will take time.Nāmnad balādyasyahipāpa-buddhiḥ.Because he is thinking ""By the strength of chantingHareKṛṣṇamantra,I can do anything, all sinful activities, and it will be adjusted,"" that is the greatest offense, not only offense, the greatest offense.Nāmnad balādyasyahipāpa-buddhiḥ."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:It is very difficult to put everyone who is living outside of the temple in one category. Some people, they are, many people that I know living outside are following strictly the regulative principles, and they are...",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:They are strictly following regulative principles and chanting their rounds and having morningāratikin their homes. And evening also, they are chanting. So instead of fighting, I think we should only try to encourage everybody to chant and follow the regulative principles.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is... Whether you live in temple or outside temple, the rules and regulation and the process must be followed. Then you are successful. It doesn't matter that you have to live in the temple.Gṛhethākovanethāko, 'hā gaurāṅga' bo'le ḍāko.Not that everyone has to live in the temple. If he does not agree with other Godbrothers, friends, he can live separately. But he must follow the rules and regulation. That is wanted. But if you live with devotees, it will be automatically done."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Easy.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore it is recommended that you live with devotees. But if you cannot agree with the devotees, you have got your own opinion, then you cannot make a new opinion so far the process is concerned. That must be followed. This is not good idea, that ""Whatever I do, it is my independence, and I will chant."" So that is good in sense that some day he will come to senses. Otherwise, for the time being, the chant is not very powerful. The fire in wet wood is not powerful. It will create some smoke. Although the fire is there. But if you put dry wood, immediately it will be blazing, and your business will be quickly done. This is intelligence. There are many examples. A patient suffering from disease, a doctor said, ""You should do; you should not do."" So if we follow ""You should not do,"" then it becomes quickly recovered. But if he becomes under the treatment of the doctor at the same time he does all nonsense, then how it can be successful? It will take time. That is stated in theCaitanya-caritāmṛta.Pāpijaneaparādhaāchāyapracūra.Pāpijaneaparādhaāchāya...Offenseless chanting is the ultimate goal. In the beginning we are not offenseless, but by chanting, chanting, by practice, we gradually become offenseless. But this is necessary, that you should be offenseless."
Devotee (3):,"Devotee (3):Śrīla Prabhupāda, it's very difficult to control my mind when I chant. It wanders.",Prabhupāda,"So what is the controlling of mind? You have to chant and hear, that's all. You have to chant with your tongue, and the sound you hear, that's all. What is the question of mind?"
Rāmeśvara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, it seems unfortunate that if the devotees cannot live in the temples, then they have to work for somekarmijust to support themselves, and then they do not have time to go on thesaṅkīrtanaparty. So it is such mercy to be on thesaṅkīrtanaparty. So it seems very unfortunate that they do not have the time.",Prabhupāda,"No, then they should live in the temple if they want to give service in thesaṅkīrtanaparty."
Rāmeśvara,We always try to encourage them to come back to the temple.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. If he does not join thesaṅkīrtanaparty, that does not mean his spiritual life is hampered. He has to follow the rules and regulation. He may not be able to join thesaṅkīrtanaparty, but he must follow the process, rules and regulation. That is wanted. And because he is living outside the temple, therefore he will forget all rules and regulation and do whatever he likes—then it will ruin the whole thing."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it faster if one lives in the temple and goes on thesaṅkīrtanaparty. Is it faster?",Prabhupāda,"That depends on him. Even in the temple, if his mind is in a different subject matter, then how it will help him?"
Bali,BaliMardana:The temple authorities like to preach that anyone who's living outside the temple is going to hell.,Prabhupāda,Generally.
Bali,BaliMardana:But even devotees who are following. They like to preach that.,Prabhupāda,"No, that is not. That is not. Just like even in ordinary business, if you transact business in the stock association, you get good business. And outside the stock association you don't get. Because association is there, there are many purchaser and many seller. So if you have to sell, you get immediate purchaser. And if you have to purchase, there is immediate seller. That is... Therefore the stock exchange is there. That is the way, that if we live together in the stock exchange of devotional service, then you can help me; I can help you. So our business will go on nicely. And outside the market, you can live three hundred miles away from the stock exchange. You will not get so many business. Like that."
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):You'll miss the opportunities.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Therefore it is helpful. If you want to do business, you must take the first opportunity, the greatest opportunity, do your business. That is intelligence. And if we think, ""All right, I shall do slowly. In seven hundred lives I shall become perfect,"" that is another thing."
Bali,BaliMardana:It is riskier to stay outside.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Otherwise why you are opening so many centers and making arrangement that ""We shall provide you with shelter, with food. These are the facilities. You live here, do whatever is your capacity. Don't sleep, but work."" This is our teaching.Satāṁprasaṅgāt,this is also, andRūpaGosvāmī says,satovṛtteḥsādhu-saṅgesadbhirbhaktiḥprasidhyati:""If you live with the association ofsādhu,devotee, then it will be quickly fruitful."" And if you live with these ordinary men, then whatever you have got will be finished very soon. There is another verse. It is said there that it is preferred to live within the cage surrounded by fire than to live with the nondevotees. It is preferred."
Bali,BaliMardana:Or with those who are too much attached to women also.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Nondevotee means too much attached to woman. That is the plain fact.
Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:Also one time in Bombay you told this verse fromCaitanya-caritāmṛta,sādhu-saṅga[Cc.Madhya22.83],sādhu-saṅga...",Prabhupāda,"Sarva-śāstrekaya,lava-mātrasādhu-saṅgesarva-siddhihaya[Cc.Madhya22.54].For me, personally, I had the opportunity to talk with my spiritual master not more than ten times in my whole life, not more. It may be less than that. But I tried to follow his instruction, that's all, although I was agṛhastha."
Bali,BaliMardana:You are a much better student than us.,Prabhupāda,"So this is the process. That is the... You sing every day.Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyāaikya**.That is the process. Wherever you live, if you follow strictly the instruction ofguru, then you remain perfect. But if we create, concoct ideas against the instruction ofguru, then we are doomed, hell.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādo yasyāprasādānnagatiḥkuto 'pi **.There is no more shelter, finished.Yasyaprasādāt.Ifguruthinks that ""This person, I wanted to take him back to home, back to Godhead. Now he is going against me. He is not following,""aprasādāt,he is displeased, then everything is finished."
Bali,BaliMardana:Vaiṣṇavāparādha.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Śrīla Prabhupāda, where does someone derive his authority...",Prabhupāda,Theguruis authority.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):No, I know, but for his actions other than just following the four regulative principles and chanting sixteen rounds. He does so many other things during the day. Where does he derive his authority if he's not, let's say, living in the temple?",Prabhupāda,I do not follow. The authority isguru. You have accepted.
Jayatīrtha:,"Jayatīrtha:Say I have some outside job, I'm living outside, but I'm not giving 50% of my income. So then that work that I'm doing, is it actually under the authority of theguru?",Prabhupāda,Then you are not following the instruction ofguru. That is plain fact.
Jayatīrtha:,"Jayatīrtha:So that means that whole activity during the day, working, that means I am not following the instruction of theguru. It's unauthorized activity.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. If you don't follow the instruction ofguru, then you are fallen down immediately. That is the way. Otherwise why you sing,yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādo **.It is my duty to satisfyguru. Otherwise I am nowhere. So if you prefer to be nowhere, then you disobey as you like. But if you want to be steady in your position, then you have to follow strictly the instruction ofguru."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):We can understand all of your instructions simply by reading your books.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Anyway, follow the instruction. That is required. Follow the instruction. Wherever you remain, it doesn't matter. You are secure. Follow the instruction. Then you are secure anywhere. It doesn't matter. Just like I told you that I saw myGuruMahārājanot more than ten days in my life, but I followed his instruction. I was agṛhastha,I never lived with theMaṭha,in the temple. It is practical. So many Godbrothers recommended that ""He should be in charge in this Bombay temple, this, that, that...""GuruMahārājasaid, ""Yes, better he lives outside. That is good, and he will do what is needed in due course of time."""
Devotees:,Devotees:Jaya! Haribol!,Prabhupāda,"He said like that. I could not understand at that time what does he expect. Of course, I knew that he wanted me to preach."
Devotees:,"Devotees:Jaya,Prabhupāda!Haribol!",Prabhupāda,"Yes, done grand style because I strictly follow the instruction of myGuruMahārāja, that's all. Otherwise I have no strength. I have not played any magic. Did I? Any gold manufacturing? (laughter) Still, I have got better disciples than the gold-manufacturingguru."
Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:Before you came, many gurus came, but they did not make any pure devotee ofKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,"How they can? He is not pure devotee ofKṛṣṇa. How he can do?Kṛṣṇa-śaktivinānāhenāmapracāra:""Without being empowered byKṛṣṇanobody can turn a person to become devotee ofKṛṣṇa."" It is not... Artificially, you cannot make. He may make show of gold manufacturing, but he cannot make a devotee ofKṛṣṇa. That is not possible."
Jayatīrtha:,Jayatīrtha:So the purpose of having the Society is to show the devotees how they can always be twenty-four hours engaged according to your instruction.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is helping one another. If I am deficient, by seeing your example I shall correct myself. This is the idea, not that a fool's paradise: all fools and join together. Not like that. There should be ideal life, at least the leaders, the president, the GBC. They will show the example, and they will follow. Then it is beneficial. And all of them are fools? Then it is fool's paradise. At least, in the blind association, at least if one man has got eyes, then he can lead all the blind men. But if all of them are blind, then it is fool's paradise. So somehow or other, we have got now a position. People likes us. So we should not spoil by personal sense gratification. That is my request. If we can maintain this institution rigidly according to the order, then many people will be benefited. By seeing our behavior, by character, they will become.Apaniācāriprabhujīveriśikṣāya.The leader should be ideal."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):We should dedicate our lives to preaching this message of LordCaitanya.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, preaching, preaching, you will become perfect preacher. Preach only what you have heard fromKṛṣṇaandguru, that's all. Don't add and subtract. Then you are secure. And if you add some concoction just like somebody says that ""I may do whatever I like independently. If I chant, then everything is all right,"" this is nonsense addition. It is not the fact. That is the danger. Some inexperienced man, he introduces some concoction. Sometimes they say, ""Prabhupāda said it."" More misleading. Yes. (end) I remember those days immediately when I see the sea."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:You were getting seasick?,Prabhupāda,"No, I liked it. Although I was sick, still, I liked it. Day and night, for thirty-five days."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:I came to America in the same way, but I was always sick. I didn't like it.",Prabhupāda,The sea journey is very good provided there is no sea-sickness. Otherwise very bad.HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHareHareRāma... [break] ...all of our books in different languages. At least all the European languages. America is one language.

Guru,Guru-kṛpa:Just a magazine.,Prabhupāda,No. His wife was translating Japanese?
Guru,Guru-kṛpa:There is a girl in Tokyo who is very expert.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Jayatīrtha:,"Jayatīrtha:YesterdayNitāifound a quote from thePurāṇasthat says, ""There are many gurus who will take away your money, but rare is the one who will take away your miseries.""",Prabhupāda,Guravobahavaḥsantivittāpahārakaḥ.
Nitāi,"Yes, right.",Prabhupāda,
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:In one lecture you were explaining those prayers,saṁsāra,and you said the first business of theguruis to take away the anxiety of the disciple.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now, our people, they have got some hope that they're going back to home, back to Godhead. And all other rascals-zero. Who is endeavoring for zero? What is this endeavor?"
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:There's nothing to do for that.,Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇa. InBhāgavataalso—gururnasasyāt.He should not beguruunless he is able to protect his disciple from the imminent danger of death.Namocayedyaḥsamupeta-mṛtyum.This cycle of birth and death is going on. Guru's business is how to stop this cycle of birth and death. And it is not very difficult. Teach him to understandKṛṣṇa, andKṛṣṇais assuring, ""If anyone understands Me nicely, then after giving up this body he comes to Me."" Where is the difficulty? Give himKṛṣṇaconsciousness, and he is saved from birth and death. There is nothing wonderful. There is no jugglery.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmeti[Bg.4.9].[break] ...only institution for mitigating the sufferings of humanity. But they don't know what is the real suffering of humanity.Dehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmeti.That is the real suffering, cycle of birth and death.Nateviduḥsvārtha-gatiṁhiviṣṇum[SB7.5.31].These rascals, they do not know what is the goal of life,svārtha,self-interest.

Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpananda:Another boy in a different place, householder, his business is making surfboards for a living. He builds the surfboards, and he puts big pictures ofKṛṣṇa, Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, on the surfboard so that when the boys are sitting on the board, like you saw that boy sitting on the surfboard, all day long they are looking at the picture.",Prabhupāda,Very good.

Guru,Guru-kṛpa:The sun is different thanVivasvān?,Prabhupāda,"Not different. Just like the sunshine is not different from the sun globe. Sun globe means all the inhabitants there, they are glowing. Therefore the whole planet is glowing."
Guru,"Guru-kṛpa:Vivasvān, he is...?",Prabhupāda,He is also glowing.
Guru,Guru-kṛpa:He will stay as long as the sun... He is present?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, he has got a duration of life. When the creation will be annihilated he'll be annihilated. He'll be not annihilated.

Satsvarūpa's party sends in the orders, and they process them from here. They handle all the business from this part of the warehouse.",Prabhupāda,What is this?
Gurudāsa:,Gurudāsa:Yogapīṭha.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's family.""Book Digest."" They publish our books?"
Kirtirāja:,"Kirtirāja:We are trying to arrange that now. All of these different... There are so many magazines we are trying to get our books listed in them. Śrīla Prabhupāda, here's a magazine which one Christian press nearby has printed, very fancy magazine, and they were distributing it for free. They just recently printed a letter and then sent this. They have gone from this to this because they cannot afford to do it any more. No one is giving them donations any more, so they've gone from big fancy magazine to a small, plain paper. This people would like to see, but now this just looks like garbage. They won't even read it.",Prabhupāda,So it has degraded.
Kirtirāja:,Kirtirāja:Yes. We have gone from this to fancy.,Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. This is our catalog.

Rāmeśvara,"It's very convenient for him to print here because he has all the credit from BBT, so the printers immediately want to do business with him.",Prabhupāda,"That's it. Yes, businessman never invests his own money. He does business with others' money. That is business. Just like I am doing. (laughter) I brought only forty rupees. That was also not spent. (laughter)"
Rāmeśvara,"This is our Golden Avatar studio where they record... They change your lectures into master tapes which can then be duplicated at high speed, and this is a complete library of all of your lectures.",Prabhupāda,Oh.

Rāmeśvara,"And also he is encouraging them to become Life Members, and sometimes through the mail they send their Life Membership fee. This is our Mail Order shipping room.",Prabhupāda,"I was doing when I was Dr. Bose's manager. Any inquiry coming from outside, I must continue correspondence with him unless he becomes a customer."

Rāmeśvara,"Yes, anything. So it's very efficient.",Prabhupāda,What is this?

Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:We were driving in a car in Hawaii. You mentioned that.,Prabhupāda,"And that's a fact. There is no happiness. We are declaring, ""That's all right, but if there is little happiness, that is in America."" So you are favored byKṛṣṇa. Utilize this favor ofKṛṣṇain glorifyingKṛṣṇa.

Paramahaṁsa,He was playingkaratālasvery nicely.,Prabhupāda,"Not only that, he's a born devotee. He'll take theāratilamp and do like this and try to open the door. Anything you... Whatever he has seen others are doing, he'll do."

Jayatīrtha:,Jayatīrtha:NewDvārakāis leading the society in child production.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, that's nice. But make them devotees. That is the real father and mother, who begets children and make him devotee. That is real father and mother. Otherwise cats and dogs. ATulasīdāsa, he has written one poetry that ""A son and the urine comes from the same way."" Son... Son means it is born out of the semina. That also comes through the genital, and the urine also comes through the genital.

Śītaanduṣṇa.Uṣṇameans hot, andśītameans cold. They are pleasing and miserable in circumstances. Cold is very pleasing in the summer, and heat is very pleasing in winter. But same heat in summer is not pleasing, and same cold in winter, it is not pleasing. So what is the actual position of cold and heat? It is simply transforming as pleasure and pain according to circumstances. Otherwise it is neither painful, neither pleasing.Harernāmaharernāmaharernāmaivakevalam[Cc.

I don't wish to divert your attention. Very interesting story. That is also mentioned in theBhagavad...,aniketa.One may have many nice places to live; still, he should think that ""I have no place to live."" That is one of the spiritual items."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:What is that story, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,"Eh? (laughter) Story is that there was a joker—His name was Gopal Bahn—of a king,RājaKṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇanagar, you know? Near Māyāpur? Yes, the king of that place. So they used to keep joker to please them by words. So the joker was constructing a new building. So it is almost finished, but there was no opening ceremony. SoRājaadvised his, one of his another friends, that ""If you can go and pass urine in that new house of Gopal—the joker's name-before the opening ceremony, then I'll give you so much prize. Go and pass urine there."" (chuckles) So, ""Yes, I'll do it."" So... No, ""Pass stool."" Yes. ""Go and pass stool there. Then I'll give you so much advance."" So one day he made this plan. He was passing, and all of a sudden entered: ""Gopal, I am very much called by nature. Kindly show me where I shall pass stool. Where I shall pass?"" So Gopal was intelligent, that it is, there is some plan. ""Yes, yes, here is lavatory. You come here."" So he is... Everything was false. So then he said, ""The door must be open. You pass stool there, but I'll see that you are passing stool and door must be open."" ""Now, how it is possible?"" ""No, it is possible. You can pass stool, but you cannot pass urine. If you pass urine, then I shall kill you."" Passing stool without passing urine, how it is possible? ""So you have come to pass stool. That you can do here, but don't pass urine."" (laughs) So that is my position. ""You may have hundreds of places, but you cannot live anywhere."" That is Kṛṣṇa's order. [break] ...place not to become attached. Yes."
Paramahaṁsa,Just likeNāradaMunigot that curse from LordBrahmā.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Not LordBrahmā, by Dakṣarāja, that ""You cannot stay anywhere more than three minutes."""
Paramahaṁsa,He is still doing that?NāradaMuni?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. His business is preaching. So we have to become, every one of us, disciple ofNāradaMuni.HareKṛṣṇa. [break] ...American people are spending, and it is going to the American people, not outside. So it is not bad idea, distribution of money. Therefore America is so opulent. Nobody's miserly. Everyone is spending. Therefore the benefit is distributed. I have got money, I am spending, so benefit is distributed."
Jayatīrtha:,Jayatīrtha:Now all the rich men in India have got all their money locked up.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, locked up. (end)"
Hanumān,"I would like to ask you why we are so fortunate to have such a nice genuine spiritual master as you, and some others have bogus spiritual master. Is it something ofkarmaor is this the pure mercy of yourself?",Prabhupāda,"No, that you can think—your spiritual master is nice, others bogus—but they do not think like that. (laughter) They will think their spiritual master is good, your spiritual master is bogus. But there is standard who is spiritual master. Spiritual master means who is the best servant of God. One who does not agree the existence of God, he is bogus because he's not bona fide,mūḍhā.One who does not accept the existence of God, he ismūḍhā.He's a rascal. He cannot... A rascal cannot become spiritual master."
Hanumān,How come we come to you?,Prabhupāda,"Well, that is another thing, but first of all we have to know who is spiritual master. The spiritual master is he,samit-pāṇiḥśrotriyaṁbrahma-niṣṭham[MU1.2.12],one who is exclusively servant of God, he is spiritual master. Otherwise anyone will come and say, ""I am spiritual master."" Anyone will come say, ""I am incarnation of God."" So there is standard. That we have to find out."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Most of the people are still ignoring God. They are so weak-willed. They are so weak-willed that they are easily swayed by, you know, when somebody comes and claims that...",Prabhupāda,"Well, if one is weak, he may be infected by some disease. It requires some resisting power. ThereforeCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid that, your answer, that ""Only the fortunate person, they can get the shelter of bona fide spiritual master.""Konabhāgyavānjīva.Not all,kona.Konameans some."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):. Some, yes.Konabhāgyavān...",Prabhupāda,"Jīva.So as there arebhagavān—somebody is rich, somebody is poor; this is also due to fortune or misfortune—similarly, if one is spiritually fortunate he gets a bona fide spiritual master."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Do you have any opinions about some of the other Indian masters who have been...,Prabhupāda,"That I have already said, that unless one is bona fide servant of God, he cannot become master."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):I mean specific people likeGuruMaharaji.,Prabhupāda,SoGuruMaharaji says that he is God himself. Then he's a bogus. How he can be God? God is so cheap? So only the foolish person will accept him. Those who have no knowledge.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Maharshi Mahesh?,Prabhupāda,I think he doesn't speak anything about God.
Guest (3):,Guest (3):No. He's teaching the transcendental meditation.,Prabhupāda,He speaks something of material prosperity. So He has nothing to do with God.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):It's just a kind of training of mind.,Prabhupāda,That's it. Just like gymnastic. You exercise; you become bodily strong. That's all.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Sai Baba?,Prabhupāda,"Sai Baba, he also says, ""I amBhagavān."" Therefore he's bogus. How you can say yourself that you areBhagavān, God? What is your power? What you have shown? And this is cheap. Now, supposing Sai Baba is God. So people accept him God, why? Because he shows some jugglery. He creates little gold. Is it not? So if, by creating gold, he is God, then there is bigger God who has created gold mine. Why shall I go to this tiny god? I must go to the big God who has created gold mine. This is common sense. But foolish people, they have no common sense even. Therefore it is calledmūḍhā.Mūḍhānābhijānātimāmebhyaḥparamavyayam. Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvairmohita,mūḍhānābhijānāti.Everything is there in theBhagavad-gītā.Just like mostly people take: ""The nature is all in all."" The scientist, they take nature. But nature is matter. So where is our experience—the matter is working automatically? Where is our experience? Hm? Matter... Does matter work automatically? What is your opinion?"
Hanumān,It's a chain of reaction.,Prabhupāda,"Reaction. First of all there must be beginning of action, then reaction."
Hanumān,In the beginning there'sKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is... I think Newton or some scientist also said that ""Original motion is given by somebody; then other motions are given."" Just like this, what is called? Railway wagons? So one engine pushes it. Then the wagon, another wagon, (makes sound) ""cutcutcutcutcut,"" like that. Wherefrom the original? That is answered in theBhagavad-gītā,"
Guest (4) (Indian man):,"Guest (4) (Indian man):Recently I was reading article in a science magazine and a space scientist, he has calculated that after 67,000 million years the universe contracts. And then I started calculating in terms of theyugasand the division which is mentioned. With the help of an astronomer I reached the conclusion that both figures coincide. So do you mean to say that when it was mentioned that after fouryugasthey will collide. Then it was a kind of vision, or might have been calculated by this...",Prabhupāda,"Means calculation. It is going on, regulated way. Just like everyone knows that this month is February. In the month of June the summer will begin. Everyone knows. It is not conclusion; it is experience. There is no need of calculating. So one who has got better experience, he can say like that. Calculation and experience. Just like if somebody says, ""Two plus two plus two plus two,"" somebody says immediately, ""Six."" And another calculates, ""Two plus two plus..., six."" So experience and calculation. Lacks experience, he calculates. One who has better experience, he doesn't calculate. One who knows past, present, and future, he doesn't require to make calculation. He knows everything. So God knows past, present, and future, and others who are favored by God, he also knows by the grace of God. Because he hears from God. God knows past, present, and future. Then he simply reproduces God's words, that's all. He doesn't require to calculate. Just like in theBhagavad-gītāit is said,sahasra-yuga-paryantam aharyadbrahmaṇoviduḥ[Bg.8.17].TheKṛṣṇasays. Now, we can say what is the age ofBrahmāby Kṛṣṇa's words. I don't require to be a very expert astrologer or astronomer. I hear fromKṛṣṇa, and I reproduce. Just like child. Father said, ""This is this;"" I say, ""This is this."" That's all. The child is not perfect, but when he says, ""Father said this is this,"" that is perfect. Therefore our process of gathering knowledge from the father—we don't calculate or don't concoct or put theories, no. We don't do that. This is calledśruti,śruti-pramāṇa,evidence fromśruti."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):LordKṛṣṇasays inGītāthat, toArjuna, that whenSūryaisuttarāyana,people who die, they'll go to Candraloka, and come back.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So you quote that. Then it is perfect. You don't require to make research. Your research is no good because your senses are imperfect. I have no proper vision. If the light is stopped, I cannot see. This is the position of my eyes. So what is the use of my seeing? It is conditional. So one who is conditional, how he can give perfect knowledge? One who is not conditional, he can give perfect knowledge. Therefore we have to approach somebody who is not conditioned. Then we get perfect knowledge."
Guest (5):,"Guest (5):I have great difficulty with the meaning of the term ""perfect knowledge."" Could you...",Prabhupāda,"Perfect knowledge means what you say, it is correct. There is no mistake."
Guest (5):,Guest (5):Under any and all circumstances.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is perfect knowledge, not like the scientists. They changes: ""Yes, it was this. Now it is now changed."" This is not perfect knowledge. They simply change. Therefore we say,mūḍhās.Perfect knowledge is that what you say, that is correct forever. That is perfect. Just like man dies. If somebody says, ""Man dies,"" it is perfect knowledge. It is correct forever."
Guest (5):,Guest (5):Suppose he is reincarnated?,Prabhupāda,"No, no, ""dies"" means the body dies. The soul does not die.Nahanyatehanyamāneśarīre[Bg.2.20].When the body annihilates... Body becomes old. Just like this cloth. I am using it, but when it will be old, no more useful, then I throw it away. I get another dress. This body is like that. Soul is eternal.Najāyatenamriyatevākadācit.It does not die, it does not take birth, but because he is in material condition, therefore he has to change the material body because no material thing is permanent. Therefore the aim of life should be how to avoid this material body. That is real business.Jīvasyatattva-jijñāsā.That is calledathātobrahmajijñāsā.This is only business, how to stop acceptance of this material body. And that is very clearly and simply stated in theBhagavad-gītā,janmakarmamedivyaṁyojanātitattvataḥ,tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaiti[Bg.4.9].We can do that. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, that you try to understandKṛṣṇa, then you are not going to accept any more material body. That means there is no more birth, no more death, no more disease, no more, and what is called, old age."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):But is it possible to lead the life of agṛhasthaand at the same time think of that?,Prabhupāda,"Well,Arjunawasgṛhasthaand a king and a politician. If he could learn within half an hour the aim of life, then where is the difficulty for agṛhastha?Arjunawas not asannyāsī.So it was spoken to him only, andKṛṣṇaselected that ""You are the right person."" So there is no question ofgṛhastha,sannyāsī.The person must be right to understand."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Is it possible to develop some such kind of psyche?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, why not?Arjunawas not willing to fight. Then he developed; ""Yes, I must fight forKṛṣṇa."" That is development."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):So there is no conflict between the...,Prabhupāda,"Gṛhasthais alsoāśrama.It is as good assannyāsaāśrama.You can accept anyāśramasuitable for you, butāśramameans cultivation of spiritual knowledge. That is the difference betweenāśramaand ordinary house. Now, this building is called temple, and the next building is called house. Why? The building is the same. But it is meant for cultivating spiritual knowledge. Therefore it is called temple, to understand God. The other house is meant for eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Therefore they are house. So you can change your house into temple provided you try to understand God. Then it isāśrama.Otherwise it is house."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):But is it possible to jump frombrahmacārīto directlysannyāsa?,Prabhupāda,It is not jumping. It is regular process.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):One should go through all the...,Prabhupāda,Yes. Just like student. Then he becomes a family man when he's grown up. Then he becomes again asannyāsī.So it is a process. It is not jumping. One after another.
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Yes, but would you allow one of the devotees to, if he wants to, observe celibacy and then...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that isbrahmacārī."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):And after that...,Prabhupāda,"After that, he should continue the life of celibacy. But if he is unable, then he's allowed to marry."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Because (Sanskrit). You cannot suppress yourkarma.,Prabhupāda,There is no question of supressing. Regulating.
Guest (5):,Guest (5):Do the same rules apply to women as to men?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,that in the society women, working class, and the mercantile class, they are, according to Vedic scripture, they are less intelligent, women, working class and mercantile men. Just like mercant..., they are after money, that's all. Andśūdra,they want, after job. And women means they are after fulfilling their material desires. They have no other idea, that there isBrahmān, one should knowBrahmān... They do not care to know. Therefore they are calledśūdras,stri,śūdra,vaiśya.Yes.Vaiśya.SoKṛṣṇasays,"
Guest (5):,Guest (5):Can a woman becomesannyāsī?,Prabhupāda,"Whysannyāsī?Kṛṣṇasays,māṁhipārthavyapāśritya[Bg.9.32].He does not say to becomesannyāsī.He said, ""One who takes shelter of Me very firmly..."" We have to take shelter ofKṛṣṇa. You becomesannyāsīor notsannyāsī—it doesn't matter. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Kṛṣṇasays,māmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja.He never says that ""You becomesannyāsī."" He never said. The qualification is how to become firmly fixed up at the lotus feet ofKṛṣṇa. That is qualification. Butsannyāsīis a process.Brahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha—that is a process. But one who takes directly shelter ofKṛṣṇais above all these processes."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):That which ŚrīlaGandhiwas working against?,Prabhupāda,If I say the truth you'll be angry. (chuckling)
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):No, no one will be angry, but you have mentioned...",Prabhupāda,"Gandhiwas a politician. What does he know aboutdharma?He was a politician. He thought it wise that British government is very strong... Before him so many political parties tried to become violent, and they were all curbed down. This Aurobindo also was a leader of anarchist party, and when he was condemned to death, then his senses came: ""This is all useless. Let me engage in performingyoga."" SoGandhithought that before him all these violent movement was cast down by the British. So he took it as a method, nonviolence, noncooperation, and to capture the public of India-India is generally inclined religiously—he became amahātmā.Butmahātmāis different. Amahātmāis not interested in politics.Mahātmānastumāṁpārthadaivīṁ-prakṛtimāśritāḥ, bhajantyananya-manaso[Bg.9.13].That ismahātmā.Mahātmāhas nothing to do with politics."
Guest (5):,Guest (5):The termmahātmāwas first used to describeGandhiby Annie Besant.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, one can use any term without any sense."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):No, I think it was by Rabindranath.",Prabhupāda,"They... Anyone can. RabindraBābuwas also like that. (laughter) He was abābu,but he becameguru. This is going on."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):That means that about thisvarṇa-saṅkaraetc—LordKṛṣṇamentions inGītā—that this present day society isvarṇa-saṅkara.,Prabhupāda,"Varṇa-saṅkara.There is novarṇāśrama;therefore all the children, they arevarṇa-saṅkara.And as soon as there isvarṇa-saṅkarapopulation, the world becomes hell. Therefore we are trying to check—""No illicit sex""—to stop thisvarṇa-saṅkara.Now thevarṇa-saṅkarahas come to such an extent that they are killing child, and that is legal. They have come down to such a extreme position."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):But surely there is a practical point of view also. There is nothing to eat. What will happen?,Prabhupāda,Who says nothing to eat? That is also their manufacture.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):I mean the figures which are published that half of humanity will starve.,Prabhupāda,"It's... Especially, we are Indian. It is advertised that we are poverty-stricken. All over the world this is advertised. Wherever I go, they say, ""Oh, you are coming from India?"" (laughter) Because they are simply begging, the government. But who is dying? There is... Dying is going on, but that death is going on in other countries also. They are dying, committing suicide. And maybe some persons are dying out of starvation. You cannot stop death. Suppose you have got enough food. That means that everything is solved? In America there is enough food. Why they are coming hippies? There is no shortage of food. Nothing... Everything is abundant, but why they are becoming hippies? They are lying down on the street, on the park and I have seen in London, the St. James Park. They are sleeping, and the police is kicking: ""Hey! Get up! Get up!"" So why? The English nation is not poor nation. The American nation is not poor nation."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Poverty is also a comparative term.,Prabhupāda,"No, I saw in Amsterdam—simply full of hippies, lying down on the street, lying down in the park, no food, no shelter. It is going on."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):The hippies are not lying in the park because they lack food.,Prabhupāda,They must be wanting something. They are in need of something.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):But not necessarily food.,Prabhupāda,"One body is in need of food; another body is in need of something else. They're needy, everyone, needy. That you have to accept. I have seen in Los Angeles. I was walking in the Beverly Hills quarter. One hippie boy is coming from a very nice house. Beverly Hills, that quarter, is resided by all rich class. And he has got very nice car, but he's hippie. Why? His father is very rich man. He has got nice car. He might be very educated. Then why he is hippie? What is the answer?"
Hanumān,He's frustrated.,Prabhupāda,"That means in need. So that is the question, that you may be in need of food, I may be in need of some woman, he may be in need of some money... In this way everyone is needy. Therefore ultimately one should search after God, when every need will be fulfilled. Just likeDhruvaMahārāja, he went... He was in need of an empire like his father. For that reason he went to the forest and performed all kinds of austerities, and when he saw God he said,svāminkṛthārto 'smivaraṁnayāce:""I have no more need. Everything is fulfilled. I don't want anything."" He... God said, ""Now whatever benediction you want, you take from Me."" He said, ""No, I don't want anything. Now everything is fulfilled."" So that is the real need. The child is crying, and he is not stopping crying. So many others coming. But as soon as his mother comes, he will stop. He understands immediately, ""Now I have got the thing, my mother."" So the real need isKṛṣṇa. That is missing. Therefore thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. All these Western students, they were in need. Now they have gotKṛṣṇa. This young man, twenty-four years old, he has got all the desires for enjoyment, but he's no more after enjoyment. He's asannyāsī.He's chantingHareKṛṣṇa. Why? [break] ...playing jugglery? He becomes God. So even the so-called yogis, they are in need. The so-calledjñānīs,they are in need. The so-calledkarmīs,they are also in need. Only thebhakta...ThatDhruvaMahārāja, he said, ""No, I am not in need.""Svāminkṛtārtho 'smivaraṁnayāce[Cc.Madhya22.42].So therefore this is the only platform to bring man to feel completely fulfilled. So it is very important movement. So I request you all to study this movement and help and join this movement. It is very scientific, authentic, and real. ThereforeKṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁ[Bg.18.66].If you want to be happy, you have to takeKṛṣṇa. Then you'll be happy. Otherwise not."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Sodharmathere means to the religious faith or duty?,Prabhupāda,"No,dharmais duty,varṇāśrama-dharma.That is also given up. That means the only duty becomes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. He said,sarva-dharmānparityajya.In the beginning He said thatdharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya.Yes.Yugeyugesambhavāmi.Now, He said that ""I appear to reestablish the principle of religion."" So at the last stage He said,sarva-dharmānparityajya.That means the so-calleddharmas,or religion, which is going on in the world, they are not real. And theBhāgavatatherefore says,dharmaḥprojjhita-kaitavo 'tra[SB1.1.2], that ""All kinds of pretending religion is rejected here."" Pretending religion, what is that? Pretending... Just like gold. Gold is gold. If the gold is in the hand of someHindu, then will it be calledHindugold? Similarly, religion means obedience to God. So where isHindureligion? Where is Christian religion? Where is Muslim religion? God is everywhere, and we are just meant for obeying God. That is one religion, obedience to God. Why they have manufactured thisHindureligion, Muslim religion, Christian religion, this religion, that...? Therefore they are all pretending religion. Real religion is obedient...Dharmaṁtusākṣādbhagavat-praṇītam[SB6.3.19].Just like law. Law is made by the state. The law cannot beHindulaw, Muslim law, Christian law, this law, that law. Law is meant for everyone. Obedience to the state. That is law. Similarly, religion means obedience to God. Then one who has no conception of God, no idea of God, where is religion? That is pretending religion. Therefore in theBhāgavatayou'll find,dharmaḥprojjhita-kaitavo 'tra:[SB1.1.2] ""All pretending type of religion is rejected."" AndKṛṣṇaalso said the same thing,sarva-dharmānparityajya:[Bg.18.66] ""You give up all this pretending religion. You simply surrender unto Me. That is real religion."" What is the use of speculating on pretending religion. That is not religion at all. Just like pretending law. Law cannot be pretending. Law is law, given by the state. Similarly, religion means the order given by God. That is religion. If you follow, then you are religious. If you don't follow, then you are demon. Make things very simplified. Then it will be appealing to everyone. So thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is meant for making things very simplified. Accept God, accept your position as God's servant and serve God. That's all, three words. You have no question? These boys?"
Hanumān,They don't speak English.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. Oh, you don't understand English."
Hṛdayānanda,"They said they are simply here feeling your presence, and they realize that you're very busy, and so they are simply feeling love for you.",Prabhupāda,Thank you very much.
Hṛdayānanda,They said they have to go now.,Prabhupāda,All right. Give themprasāda.Everyone should be supplied with.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):What do you see as the future of your movement and are you planning to...,Prabhupāda,My movement is genuine.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):...to choose a successor.,Prabhupāda,"It is already successful. Genuine thing is always success. Gold is gold. If somebody is fortunate, he can purchase gold, but gold remains gold. If somebody purchases and somebody does not, it doesn't matter. Gold is gold. So future, gold future is always the same as it is at present—if it is gold. If it is something glittering, that is another thing."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):But there must be somebody, you know, needed to handle the thing.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that we are creating. We are creating these devotees who will handle."
Hanumān,"One thing he's saying, this gentleman, and I would like to know, is your successor named or your successor will...",Prabhupāda,"My success is always there. Yes. Just like the sun is there always. It may come before your vision or not. The sun is there. But if you are fortunate, you come before the sun. Otherwise you remain in darkness. Sun is open to everyone. OurKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement—Kṛṣṇais open to everyone. But if you are fortunate, you come to the light. If you are unfortunate, do not. That is your choice.Kṛṣṇasays,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].You do it. Now it is your choice. You surrender toKṛṣṇaor don't surrender. That is your business. We are canvassing everyone, ""Take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness and you'll be happy."" Now it is their business to take it or not to take it. But he can come. He can ask question and then ""How? Why shall I take it?"" That we are ready, to convince him. That is preaching."
Hanumān,"When you have come to United States, you had nothing...",Prabhupāda,"I came to give you. Some of you have taken, and some have not taken, so what can I do? I came to give youKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is my duty. MyGuruMahārājaordered and I came. And... But some of you, you have taken, and most of, they have not taken. So that is another thing. But I came to deliver you the genuine thing. That's all."
Hanumān,"The way you have come is that you have come as though you've not come from a religion or nothing. You've come and everybody fall in love with you, you preach, and, Prabhupāda, we cannot deny you are the authority because you know everything, and your...",Prabhupāda,"Any way you take it, then you become happy. That's all. Of course, when you take it out of love... That is a fact. So without love, this transaction, because there is no price for it... All other transaction, there is exchange of price. Here there is no price, so out of love only, one can take it, not by paying any price. It is not possible. To pay the price ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness is not possible. Yes."
Hanumān,"You cannot force anybody to say, ""I am theguru. I'm the (indistinct). Fall in love with me.""",Prabhupāda,"Why shall I force? What is my... That is not my business. I am Kṛṣṇa's servant. I simply say, ""Here is good thing. You take it."" Now,Kṛṣṇaalso says that. He does not force.Kṛṣṇais God. He can force, but He does not do that."
Guest (6):,Guest (6):Good night now.(?),Prabhupāda,Bringprasādafor them.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):How long you'll stay?,Prabhupāda,Here?
Hṛdayānanda,About three more days.,Prabhupāda,Three more days. That is in his hand. First of all give here. (prasādabeing distributed) [break]
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Gītā,Kṛṣṇa,Caritāmṛta,andBhāgavatam.You have other texts?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):What do you recommend?,Prabhupāda,Yes.Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.We have translated it-Nectar of Devotion.This in...
Guest (2):,Guest (2):This is in Sanskrit or...,Prabhupāda,"No, English."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Bengali? No, but original.",Prabhupāda,Original Sanskrit.
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Apart from (indistinct) quality of LordRāma, are there a few other things which could be included while you are worshiping or devoting or meditating on...?",Prabhupāda,"God has all the qualities that you can conceive. It is generally not...Bhaga(?), it is taken as six, six opulences.Bhagameans opulence, andvānmeans possessing.Bhagavat.Bhagavat-śabda.Bhagameans opulence, andvatmeans one who possesses. And the first word inbhagavat-śabdaisbhagavān.Thisbhagameans six kinds of opulences: riches, then fame, then bodily strength, influence, knowledge, beauty, and renunciation. These are opulences. If one is very rich, people are attracted. If one is very reputed, people are attracted. If one is very strong, people are attracted. Influential-attracted. If one is very beautiful, man or woman, he is also attractive. If one is very wise, he's attractive. And one who is renounced, he's also attra... SoKṛṣṇahas got all these qualification in full. That is the definition of God. Anyone who possesses all these qualities in fullness, not partially, that is God. This is the definition of God. Not that ""I can produce one ounce of gold,"" but if he can produce all the mines of gold, he is God. Not cheap God. In that way everyone is God. (end) Theory? Theory of?"
Professor:,Professor:Knowledge. Ways to approach nature.,Prabhupāda,So what is your decision? What is the position of the living entities?
Hṛdayānanda,"(translating) She says she's... They're more or less concerned with the theory of knowledge, rather than actually having some knowledge.",Prabhupāda,What is that theory of knowledge?
Professor:,"Professor:Yes. I had been studying the Sanskrit, the texts of Śaṅkara especially, thebhāṣyaofBadarāyaṇa.",Prabhupāda,"No, theory of knowledge, how it is explained? Every living being has got knowledge. What is that theory of knowledge?"
Professor:,Professor:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"Every individual being has knowledge. Even a small ant, it has got knowledge. Knowledge... Of course, development of knowledge according to the body, but a living entity, even the trees, they have got knowledge. They grow... When there is some block, they do not grow that side; they grow this side. Is it not?"
Professor:,Professor:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So every living being has got knowledge. The basic knowledge, how to maintain, every one has got."
Professor:,Professor:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"No, knowledge... Living entity, by constitutional position, has got knowledge, but in connection with this material world, when this living entity comes to this material world, so according to the body, the development of knowledge differs."
Professor:,"Professor:If one is following different stage, status of knowledge...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Different stage of knowledge means different types of body. Just like a child. A child is talking in some way. The same child, when he will get a different body, youthful body, he'll talk differently. What do you think?"
Guest (1) (German Man):,"Guest (1) (German Man):I would like to ask you a question. Once Leibnitz, who is one of the fathers of the Western tradition, formulated the question which was the beginning of metaphysics in a way, Western metaphysics. The question is ""Why there is anything?"" What is your stand about this classic point?",Prabhupāda,Why?
Hṛdayānanda,Why anything exists? What is the reason for the existence of...?,Prabhupāda,"(chuckles) ""Why anything exists?"" (laughter) What do you mean by anything?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, that's precisely the point. What is the purpose? What is the sense, if there is any, or does the very question make sense?",Prabhupāda,"No, no, unless understand what is that ""anything..."" First of all, you have to understand what is that ""anything."" Anything... Just like this book, this table, this bell, the electric they are so many things. So you can take any one of them; that is anything. What is your idea of anything?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Oh, reality. Material, external, reality to our ego, our internal reality as well.",Prabhupāda,Internal reality and external reality?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Both. For me, the word ""anything"" covers both.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So that also we understand, ""anything."" There are so many varieties of things, and you can take any one of them. That is ""anything."" But your question should be, ""Wherefrom these things coming?"" That should be the proper question."
Professor:,"Professor:What is the reason of this (indistinct) ""anything""?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. There are so many things, and you can take any one of them. That is ""anything."" But the real question should be ""Wherefrom all these things are coming?"" That is real question, ""What is the origin of all these things?"""
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, origin, that is more on the theoretical side. It's a question, ""Why?"" But I am, rather, after the purpose.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is a nice question. But there is the real source of everything. That is theVedānta-sūtra...Perhaps you have read.Vedānta-sūtra,first question is: ""Wherefrom all these things come?"" So the answer is thatjanmādyasyayataḥ:[SB1.1.1]""Brahmān. The original thing isBrahmān, or the Absolute Truth, and from Him, everything is emanating."" Just like physical... The sun is there, and whole material world is product of the sunshine. What your physical science says? Eh? Eh? Do they not say? It is a fact that sunshine... Due to the sunshine all these material things are there."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Well, it's more involved than just saying that. Sun is just a big complex of hydrogen and helium, a bigpileof rubbish really, but it develops this marvelous reactions which causes it to work as a big nuclear reactor, an entirely different story, what the vision of science, of the present science, about the meaning of celestial bodies and the meaning of, in particular, of sun and moon and so on. We are extremely realistic about this world. We can't see, assuming all the glory of that what happens on the earth due to the existence of those bodies, we do not try to look inside of the structure of these things, as something meant for us. Just universe as it is... And this question, like Nietzchean question which I am repeating—that's not my point—this big question is... Western philosophy presently does not answer, does not ask this question. I think that this scientist who did ask it had quite a point. This question expresses the quest of the human race for some meaning for some sense, for some sense. That's what religion is now offering us, or philosophy, or... Rarely, directly, we hear the direct answer to that.",Prabhupāda,What is your direct answer?
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Oh, I don't have any. If I would have, I wouldn't ask you.",Prabhupāda,That means your knowledge is insufficient.
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Precisely. Precisely. That is the beginning of...,Prabhupāda,"Therefore, if you have no answer. That's all right. That ""We don't know"" means our knowledge is insufficient. But knowledge means must be progressive. We should not remain in insufficient knowledge. We must make further progress to get sufficient knowledge. Inquiry."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):But you referred to some other, more direct ways of acquiring knowledge than just the standard...",Prabhupāda,"No, because we have got insufficient knowledge, we cannot approach directly. It is not possible. We have to take knowledge—who has got sufficient knowledge, from him. Because you have got insufficient knowledge, so you cannot make progress. Just like beyond this wall, you cannot say what is there. That is insufficient knowledge. But that does not mean there is nothing. Because you cannot say what is beyond this wall, that does not mean that there is nothing beyond this wall. Your knowledge is insufficient. Is it not?"
Professor:,Professor:But this was more or less my question...,Prabhupāda,Just try to hear. Then...
Professor:,Professor:If Indian philosophy...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, it is no Indian or American. It is the philosophy. It is philosophy. The philosophy is not Indian or American. Truth is truth, not Indian truth or American truth. That is not truth. That is relative truth. The Absolute Truth is absolute. That is neither Indian nor American nor..."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):But in what sense you use the concept ""truth"" here? Is it in the ontological sense, or is it in somehow in a more pragmatical human sense, refers to human beings or...?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is pragmatic, that you cannot see beyond this wall. That is your insufficient knowledge or your senses are insufficient. You cannot go beyond this wall. But that does not mean there is nothing beyond this wall. So if you want to know what is beyond this wall, you have to know from a person who knows it. Yes. Because you cannot see, you cannot know, that is not the end. There must be something."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):What?,Prabhupāda,"Eh? It is actual fact. That is pragmatic. It is actual fact. There is... So many things there are, but you do not know because your senses are imperfect. Your eyes are imperfect, your touch, imperfect, the gathering senses... The senses which gathers knowledge... Just like eyes... We can see and gather knowledge. We can hear; we gather knowledge. We can taste; we gather knowledge. So, because your senses are imperfect, therefore your knowledge gathered, that is imperfect."
Professor:,Professor:But in the case of a mystical man that has been able to see...,Prabhupāda,"There is no question of mystic. First of all we have to admit that on account of our senses being imperfect, whatever knowledge we gather, that is imperfect. That is imperfect. Therefore, if you want to possess real knowledge you have to approach somebody who is perfect. You cannot...Huh?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):How can we know that somebody is perfect?,Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. But first of all, the basic principle is we have to understand that our senses are imperfect, and whatever knowledge we gather by these imperfect senses, they are imperfect. So if we want perfect knowledge, then we have to approach somebody whose senses are perfect, whose knowledge is perfect. That is the principle. That is the Vedic principle. Therefore the Vedic principle says,tad-vijñānārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet[MU1.2.12].You know Sanskrit, yes. ""In order to know that perfect knowledge, one should approachguru."" So who isguru? Then the next question will be... Your question is that, ""How I can?"""
Guest (1):,Guest (1):How can I know that...?,Prabhupāda,"That I am coming. That I am coming.Guru... That is next line. It is said,śrotriyaṁbrahma-niṣṭham.Gurumeans who has properly heard theVedas,śruti. Śrotriyam.And as a result of his hearing he is firmly convinced in the existence of the Absolute Truth, God."
Professor:,"Professor:Well, this is... We've only come to one of the mentioned(?) theories of knowledge, I think,śabda.",Prabhupāda,"Sata? Śabda,yes,śabda-brahman.Yes."
Professor:,"Professor:Then if you are able to communicate to heart with knowledge throughśabda,no?",Prabhupāda,"Yes.Śabda-brahman.Just like many thousands of miles away we are getting some radio message and we learn that ""Something is happening there. Something is there."" Thereforeśabda.This is...Śabdameans sound, sound, sound vibration. So that is the real source of knowledge. That is the real source of...Śabda-brahman."
Professor:,Professor:One of the sources of knowledge or the only one?,Prabhupāda,"No, that is the only one. There are others; they are subordinate. But theśabda,knowledge received,śabda,throughśabda,śabda-brahman,that is perfect knowledge. Just like the same example: beyond this wall I cannot see, but if somebody there says, ""This is the position here""—the sound comes—that is perfect. You cannot see what is going on, but if somebody says, sends radio message or any message, sound, then you know. Thereforeśabda-pramāṇa,śabda,knowledge received throughśabda,that is perfect knowledge."
Professor:,"Professor:That means throughśabda,and through other means you can have a direct intuition but you can't intact... Direct intuition of things.",Prabhupāda,"Intuition is different. Direct perception.Śabda,you can (have) direct perception. It is not intuition. It is perception. Therefore the word is used,śrotriyambrahma-niṣṭham[MU1.2.12].So our process is to receive knowledge throughśabda-brahman,Vedic. Just likeekonārāyaṇaasit.Ekonārāyaṇaasit:""Before creation there was onlyNārāyaṇa.""Nabrahmānaīśaḥ:""There was noBrahmā; there was no Śiva."" So this isśabda-pramāṇa,śabda-pramāṇa,that ""In the beginning there was God, nothing else."" So in this way our Vedic principle is: when your knowledge is corroborated by the Vedic version then it is perfect."
Professor:,Professor:But according to Śaṅkara it is not only way that you can approach truth. You can also approach through deduction.,Prabhupāda,"There are many ways. Just like hypothesis. Hypothesis. Yes. History, history. Hypothesis, history. Then direct perception. There are many. But of all these,śabda-pramāṇais taken as best.Śabda-pramāṇa,evidence through the sound. That is the best."
Professor:,"Professor:No, but (indistinct). According to (indistinct). If one comes to value, existential value of a thing, through deduction... Is it possible or not only through intuition, through direct intuition of the reality of the whole?(?)",Prabhupāda,Value by intuition?
Professor:,"Professor:Direct knowledge of the existence of a thing, of anything.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. The knowledge of existence, thatnityaḥ-śāśvato 'yam,nityaḥṣāṣvataḥ,that is knowledge of existence. So you have to learn which isnityaand which is notnityafrom the authority. ""This isnitya,and this isanitya."" Sonityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13).These are the Vedic version: ""There is one chiefnityaamongst the manynityas."" Just like we, we living entities, we arenityas,eternal. First of all try to understand eternity. You were a child or I was a child. Now that body, child body, is no longer existing. But I understand, I know, that I had a body, child. Therefore I amnitya.I am existing. The body has gone, but I am existing. Therefore I am eternal,nitya.Is it clear?"
Professor:,"Professor:Well, I remember one other explanation, that when you are sleeping and you have a dream...",Prabhupāda,"No, when I am sleeping I am working."
Professor:,"Professor:...and you have a dream, and then, when you are coming back from sleep...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Professor:,Professor:...you can remember your dream.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Professor:,Professor:That means that you are conscious of your existence even on the suppression of consciousness.,Prabhupāda,"I am not only conscious, but the consciousness depends on me. Because I am there, therefore consciousness... So I amnitya.This is the proof ofnitya,that many changes have taken place, but the changes, the phenomenal changes, they have gone out. They are no more existing. Therefore they are notnitya.Just like dream. At night I saw one dream, but the dream is no more existing, but I remember that last night I saw the dream. Therefore I amnitya.And the dream isanitya.The dream isanitya.Similarly, this phenomenal world, when I am not sleeping, but I am so-called awakened, so I am seeing. I am seeing you, I am seeing the table, this book, you see, but... (aside:) Don't... But when I am asleep I forget all these things. I forget. I am in a different world. I am seeing different things. So this is also dream, and the dream at night, that is also dream. But I, the seer of this dream and that dream, I am the eternal."
Professor:,Professor:The thing is not to make dependent on the conscious of any individual the existence of thing.,Prabhupāda,"Existence of thing... I say that at night, when I am dreaming, I do not see existence of these things. And at this time, in daytime, when I am seeing these things, I do not see the existence of the dream. So the conclusion should be both these things I see in daytime and I see at night, they have no existence. They are phenomenal. But I am the seer; I am eternal. I am existing. This is the proof. Because at night I am seeing and daytime I am seeing, so therefore I am eternal. But the phenomenal manifestation, they are temporary. We don't say it is false. Temporary. TheMāyāvādīphilo... Śaṅkara said it is false.Brahmasatyaṁjaganmithyā.Mithyāmeans false. We don't say false. We don't say that this book is false. It has got reality, but temporary. This book has come into form at a certain date, and it will exist for certain days, and when it will be worn out or old, there will be no existence. Therefore the formation of this book is temporary. But I am the reader of the book; I am eternal. So two things are there, temporary and eternal. The temporary existence, somebody says, ""False,"" but we say, ""It is not false; it is temporary."" But there is an eternal existence. Just like I am eternal. That is... We have to learn fromśabda,vibration.Nahanyatehanyamāneśarīre[Bg.2.20].You understand Sanskrit.Nahanyatehanyamāneśarīre[Bg.2.20].That eternal thing is existing, it will continue to exist. Even after the destruction of this temporary body, it will continue to exist."
Professor:,"Professor:But coming again to the question that Professor (indistinct) put to you, but it is possible to understand all those things (indistinct)",Prabhupāda,You have to understand... I have already said that we have got our imperfect senses. We cannot understand. But we have to understand from a person who has got perfect knowledge.
Professor:,Professor:But why existence of all these things?,Prabhupāda,"So? Why? Then the answer will be: ""Why there shall not be existence?"" First of all you answer this. If you question like that—""Why there is existence?""—then I shall inquire, ""Why there shall not be existence?"" Therefore the decision should be taken from the Absolute. Your question, my answer, will not solve. If you say, ""Why there is existence?"" I can ask you, ""Why there shall not be existence?"" And who will decide this?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):If I may something, this basic question, I suppose, may be asked only on the level of all religion, all philosophy, which does not put a line of division between practice in life...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):...and abstract investigations. Now, in normal Western thinking we do deny the very purpose of that question. As a matter of fact, we never ask it. Since time when Leibnitz did ask this question we all forgot it, or deliberately we suppress it. We simply say, ""All right, let's be concerned only with those things which we can deal with effectively in material world. And the question of purpose let's leave aside."" Now, I suppose that within this system of thought which you have...",Prabhupāda,"I may tell you two things. The purpose is... That is experienced by every one of us, what is the purpose of life, what is the purpose, anything. That, everyone, we can understand very easily. The purpose isānanda.Pleasure. That is the purpose. There is no difficulty to understand what is the purpose. The purpose is pleasure-seeking. Or purpose is pleasure. One who hasn't got the pleasure, he's seeking after it. That is the purpose. Purpose isānanda. Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12).That is theVedānta-sūtra.Everyone of us, seekingānanda.The scientific knowledge, philosophy, or even driving the car or whatever you are doing—the purpose isānanda.That is a common factor. Purpose is... Why I am eating palatable dishes? I can eat anything, but I am seeking that ""This sort of foodstuff will please me."" That isānanda."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):That is driving force and motivation of most human activities. But the question, purpose, which Leibnitz was asking for, he was asking on higher plane, in abstraction.",Prabhupāda,"Higher plane means you are seeking after pleasure, but that is being obstructed. That is your position. You are seeking pleasure, but it is not unobstructed. Therefore you are seeking higher, where there is no obstruction. Pleasure is the purpose, but when you speak of higher plane, that means you are experiencing obstruction in getting pleasure. So you are seeking a platform where there is no obstruction. But the purpose is the same."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Must it necessarily be so? That would be so, supposing that we human beings are at the center of existence, and our criteria should be applied, measuring everything which exists. Now, the question, ""Why there is anything?"" is asked on the more higher level, in the sense, trying to forget about this answer for anthropocentric thinking.",Prabhupāda,"No, thinking..."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):This question relates to everything what may exist, other beings, other intelligences.",Prabhupāda,"This is a fact, that intelligent or not intelligent, that doesn't matter. Everyone is seeking pleasure,ānanda.The Sanskrit word isānanda.Soānanda...Suppose I am constructing a big house to live there, but before the construction is finished I am, by nature, I am taken away. I die. Just like Napoleon. That, in France, that Arc in Paris?"
Devotee:,Devotee:ArcdeTriumph.,Prabhupāda,"He could not finish. You see? There are so many things. We are thinking, ""By finishing this, we shall be happy,"" but that is sometimes hampered. Soānandais checked. So this is the position. So higher means whereānandais not checked. That is higher position. The purpose isānanda,but in this material world we are experiencingānandabeing checked. Just like nobody wants to die. That's a fact. Why you shall die? I already discussed that I know that I was a child, I was a boy, I was a young man, and now I have got this body, old man's body. It is now going to finish. So I am little anxious. Now, whateverānandaI was drawing in my living condition, now it is going to be finished. But if we think properly that ""I am eternal, so although the body will be finished, I'll not be finished..."" This is very natural, that ""I was not finished. Because my childhood body was finished, so I was not finished. My boyhood body was not finished; I was not finished. My youthhood was finished, but I was not finished."" Similarly, the conclusion should be: ""Even though this body will be finished, I'll not be finished."" That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,tathādehāntaraprāptir dhīrastatranamuhyati[Bg.2.13].Dhīra,one who is intelligent, he is not disturbed.Dhīrastatranamuhyati.Sodhīra,one who isdhīra,sober, philosopher, he knows that ""I am not going to be finished. I shall have to accept another body."" Now, whether that body will beānanda?That is the consideration. I'll get another body, just like I have got this body, after changing so many bodies. Moment after moment, we are changing body. That is the medical science, changing of blood corpuscles. So this body will be changed again. Then I will have to enter the mother's womb and packed up for at least ten months in suffocated condition. This is scientific, all. Then again I'll come out when the body is prepared nicely to come out and exist. So that period of formation of body is notānanda.To remain compact in this way for ten months, it is notānanda.It is notānanda,just oppositeānanda.Then when we die... Die, death, means the miserable condition is so great that we cannot live. We have to go out. There is noānanda.Then, when we have got this body, changing, there is noānandabecause we are sometimes diseased, and to become old man, that is also notānanda.Therefore I am eternal. I am seeking after something which is eternalānanda.Therefore next consideration should be that ""Whether this condition of repetition of birth, death, old age and disease can be changed?"" That is next question. And if there is possibility, then we shall try for it. But there is possibility here. The conclusion is: so long we get this material body... Because matter is not eternal. Anything you take, material—earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego—these are all material things. So these material things, they are not eternal, none of them. This table is created; it is not eternal. It will be finished at a certain date, anything you take. But I am eternal. So if I transfer myself in another nature which is eternal, then myānandawill be eternal. That is the purpose of life."
Professor:,"Professor:No, but the point is the identity betweenātmānand...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, I amātmā.You areātmā. Ātmā."
Professor:,"Professor:...theātmanof the world, let's say, absolute...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. TheātmāandParamātmā,Paramātmā. As I was speaking,nityo nityānām.We are allnityas,eternal, but there is one chiefnitya.Just like leader. Everywhere we go, we have got a leader. Now, this, your Mexico state, there is a president. You cannot avoid it. In your college there is principal. There must be a leader. Similarly, the whole thing taken together, there must be one leader. You have to speak from experience that in your physical department or in your religious department there is a chief, leader, professor. Or you may be. But that is the way. Therefore Vedic information is that we are eternal, but there is another eternal who is chief eternal. That is God. He is eternal; we are also eternal. Then what is difference? The difference is thatekoyobahūnāṁvidadhātikāmān:""That one eternal, chief eternal, He is maintaining all the subordinate eternals."" So both eternals are eternal and... The purpose is pleasure. Just like a small example, a family man. The father is the chief man in the family. The mother is there, the children are there, all together. But the father is the chief man in the family. He is maintaining the family, and there isānanda,pleasure. Similarly,ānandais the aim of both, all the eternals, the chief eternal or the subordinate eternal. But the supplier is the chief eternal. So when we come together, the chief eternal and the subordinate eternals, and enjoy together, that is the purpose of life."
Professor:,"Professor:According to existential philosophy or Indian philosophy, like for instance the Ramakrishna and Vivekananda and all that...",Prabhupāda,They are not philosopher. They have no philosophy.
Professor:,Professor:Eh?,Prabhupāda,They have no philosophy.
Professor:,Professor:I think you are also supporting the possibility to acquire knowledge through contact.,Prabhupāda,"Our position is—I have already explained—that we are all imperfect. Therefore we have to take knowledge from the perfect. So God is perfect, orKṛṣṇais perfect, so we have to receive knowledge from Him. Then our knowledge is perfect. And so long we shall speculate, that is not perfect because you are speculating with imperfect instruments, what is the use? If I want to cut this table, I must have proper instrument. If I want to cut this table with this book, ""Let me cut this,"" how it will be possible? You must know that for cutting this table it requires this instrument."
Professor:,"Professor:Yes, they say that the only way to acquire knowledge is throughśabda.",Prabhupāda,Yes.Śabda-pramāṇa.
Professor:,Professor:And I think otherpramāṇaswill be also possible according to those...,Prabhupāda,"Just like I am trying something, and some experienced man says, ""Do like this."" This isśabda-pramāṇa.Theśabda-pramāṇa,one who knows, he says, ""Do like this."" The ""Do like this,"" meansśabda,sound, and it enters your ear, and you do adjustment. Thereforeśabda-pramāṇa.Just like you are sleeping, and one is, another man is coming to kill you. And another friend says, ""Get up, get up, get up! There is enemy. He is coming to kill you."" Then you wake up. Therefore the sound is thepramāṇa,there was enemy. These are crude examples. When you are asleep, you cannot understand. You have got eyes, you have got hands, you have legs but no experience, but the ear gives you warning even if you are sleeping. There is enemy, your eyes cannot see, your hand cannot touch, but the ear can give you evidence, ""Yes."" As soon as you are awakened you say, ""Yes, here is enemy. He is coming to kill me."" Therefore the aural reception, sound reception, is the evidence. Knowledge received through authentic sound vibration, that is perfect."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Let's just say I would like to ask a question in this way. We don't doubt what you said, the assumption that individual ego is eternal and also subordinate to that which is eternal, hierarchically higher, nevertheless is the part of that which is the eternal reality. And that is (indistinct) that which you later developed. Question, sir: Is this statement what you made, a statement of fact based on direct perception, or it is something what follows traditional belief and is just the axiomatic basis of your philosophy or similar other philosophies of axiomatic basis.",Prabhupāda,"No, this is axiomatic basis because you have to accept that your senses are imperfect. So you, by speculation, cannot have perfect knowledge. This is axiomatic truth."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):With that epistemological truth, all right we may go along, and, as a matter of fact, doubt about the truths of direct sensual perception is the basis, one of models of scientific activity.",Prabhupāda,Direct perception...
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):My question is, rather, this statement, this basic statement about eternal ego and so on, is a statement which you somehow give to us as revealed message, something what is...,",Prabhupāda,"Yes, revealed."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):...or is...? Yes. Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Revealed. It is revealed. Hm? Just like in theBhagavad-gītāthe vibration is coming fromKṛṣṇa. Now, you practically realize it: ""Yes, what is said is correct."" That is direct perception. First of all, you receive the message, and then apply your logic and see that it is fact. Therefore it is perfect. When you receive the knowledge and when you directly apply it to your perception, when you see it is correct, that is the proof that the message which you received, that is correct."
Professor:,"Professor:Very difficult to have proofs of that, where the eternality of your ownātmanfor instance, things of that...",Prabhupāda,"That is called realization. Yes. First of all you receive the sound, then apply your instruments, and when you find it, it is correct—that is the realization. So our process is to receive knowledge from the perfect. That's all. We are not perfect. But the knowledge we are getting, that is perfect. So according to that perfect direction, if we mold our life, then we are successful. Otherwise you go on experimenting, speculating.Ciraṁvicinvan.Ciram,you understand, ""perpetually,""vicinvan,""thinking.""Ciraṁvicinvan."
Professor:,Professor:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"But that is the tendency of modern... They do not accept that their senses are imperfect. They want to see something, distant place, with microscope... What is called? Telescope. Telescope. But the telescope is manufactured by you. It is imperfect."
Professor:,"Professor:But I would say that even in India, where ancient tradition... They would propose how to arrange our telescopes to be able to see more correctly.",Prabhupāda,"You have to see... That... Vedic injunction says,śāstra-cakśuṣā. Śāstra-cakśuṣā:""Your eyes should be theśāstra."" There is another crude example. Just like who is your father? How do you understand? Through the vibration of the mother. The mother says, ""He is your father."" You accept it. Otherwise there is no experiment. So things which are beyond your perception, beyond your defective senses, that should not be speculated.Natāṁstarkeṇayojayet.Acintyākhalvyebhāvānatāṁstarkeṇayojayet.These are the injunction. What is beyond your perception, beyond your speculation, don't waste your time so-called argument and logic. What is argument? Mother says, ""He is your father."" Where is the argument? You cannot apply any argument."
Professor:,"Professor:No, I said old tradition in India has been going on into argument itself.",Prabhupāda,"No, argument you can go on, but if you want to know the truth it will not be attained by argument because argument is also within your thinking power: thinking, feeling, willing. So if your thinking, feeling, willing is imperfect, what is the use of your argument? What is the use of your so-called advancement of knowledge? Basically, if the senses, knowledge acquiring senses, are imperfect, then how you can get perfect knowledge?"
Professor:,"Professor:Well, then what do we with all techniques, all systems, that have been developed? I am thinking only India, I am not thinking other places, and all the old tradition, since Śaṅkara onwards, of different ways to think, to study, to go deeply to all these relations between...",Prabhupāda,Śaṅkara has interpreted. Śaṅkara has interpreted by his limited knowledge. So that is not perfect knowledge. Therefore we don't accept Śaṅkara's philosophy.
Professor:,"Professor:But I said if he belongs to the same tradition, and you belong to the other...",Prabhupāda,"That tradition is nothing. Tradition is just temporary. You make your tradition; he makes your tradition. That is another thing. But the, fact is fact. That is not dependent on tradition. Tradition we can make, tradition. ""We believe."" Just like somebody says, ""We believe."" What is the use of such saying, ""We believe""? You may believe something which is not fact."
Professor:,"Professor:Yes, but we could say that since theUpaniṣadsand later, all things have been sustaining the thing which you have just said a moment ago, that there exists an identity betweenātmanandBrahmān.",Prabhupāda,"Identity is there. That, therefore, I have already said,nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānṁ.Both of them are identical so farnityais concerned orcetanais concerned, but one is dependent, and other is maintainer. That is difference. Both of them are truth. Both of them truth. You are truth; I am truth. You are living; I am living, existing. This is truth. This is truth, but you are professor and I am something else. That is temporary. But so far you are, as living being, and I am, as living being, that is truth. But your dress and my dress, that is temporary. So we have to understand like that. In this material world we are mixed up with temporary and eternal. The living entity is eternal, but his body is temporary. This is the position. So the problem is: why the eternal has got temporary things? That is hampering hisānanda.Just like I am sitting here. Now, if somebody says, ""Now you'll have to die and accept another body,"" this is not very pleasing to me. Or even I am sitting in this apartment, and somebody..., ""No, you change your apartment. Come. Come here."" Again I change another apartment. So I'll seek after: ""Why I am changing this apartment? Is it not possible to get an eternal apartment?"" That should be thebrahma-jijñāsā.That is...Vedānta-sūtrafirst says,athātobrahmajijñāsā.""Why I am subjected to this change?"" That is intelligence. ""Why not eternal apartment if I am eternal?"" That is intelligence."
Professor:,"Professor:Did you say that for theātman,are part of the eternal? For theātman,it is... A need for the being is for the purpose,ānanda.",Prabhupāda,"Ānanda,yes."
Professor:,Professor:That means he is inquiring...,Prabhupāda,"Nature, natureānanda."
Professor:,"Professor:This other thing, they have it because oflīlā,pleasure, playing.",Prabhupāda,That is alsoānanda.Just like somebody goes within the water. Nowadays it has become a fashion. What is that? Go within the water?
Devotee:,Devotee:Diving.,Prabhupāda,"But he does not belong to the water, but he takes some pleasure."
Professor:,Professor:He needs the pleasure.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore he's seeking pleasure. That is the real aim. Therefore he's going into the water. He has no business to go to the water, but because he is seeking pleasure—""Let me see if there is some pleasure. Experiment."" That's all. But he does not get... Just like they are going to the moon planet, moon planet: ""Let us see."" Because there is noānanda,he is seeking another type ofānanda.And now they have failed. Now they're going to Venus or what?"
Devotees:,Devotees:Mars.,Prabhupāda,"Mars. This is going on.Bhūtvābhūtvāpralīyate[Bg.8.19].He's not seeking after where is eternal happiness. He's... Temporarily, he's seeking here, there.Bhūtvābhūtvāpralīyate.In this way his life is finished, seekingānanda,and he gets another body, another term. So his intelligence is not coming to the point that ""What is thisānanda?I am eternal. I am seeking eternalānanda.Why thisānanda?Sometimes this body, sometimes this position, sometimes that position—what is this?"" That is intelligence."
Professor:,Professor:I understand it very well from the point of view of particular individual andātman...,Prabhupāda,"Individual, we are part and parcel. The same thing: the supreme eternal, and we, means subordinate eternal. We are of the same quality. Quality is the same but quantity different. Therefore our knowledge quantity and his knowledge quantity different. Therefore we should take knowledge from Him, who has large quantity of knowledge. We have got tiny quantity of... This is the difference. He is also cognizant, I am also cognizant, but his knowledge is vast, unlimited; my knowledge is tiny. Therefore, if I want to know more, we should know from Him. That is perfect knowledge.Tad-vijñānārthamsagurumevābhigacchet śrotriyaṁbrahma-niṣṭham[MU1.2.12].This is the process."
Professor:,Professor:May I ask a personal question?,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Professor:,Professor:I heard that you were a chemist before.,Prabhupāda,"I was not chemist, but I was manager in a big chemical factory. Therefore, automatically, I learned something of chemist. And later on I started my own chemical factory."
Professor:,Professor:You were belonging to Bengal?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Professor:,Professor:And you were having also aguruthere?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes, certainly. Withoutguruhow can you..."
Professor:,"Professor:Yes, naturally.",Prabhupāda,He is myguru. Show thephoto.
Devotee:,"Devotee:It's just above you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. He is myguru."
Professor:,"Professor:But you are of the same line ofPuruṣottamaSarasvatī, the great philosopher, no?",Prabhupāda,"PuruṣottamaSarasvatī? No, myGuruMahārājawasSarasvatī, BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatī."
Professor:,"Professor:Oh,Bhakti... So that's the same line, no?",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. That receiving the perfect knowledge... There isparamparā.Just like I have got perfect knowledge. I tell you. Then you get the perfect knowledge. You tell him. This is calledparamparā."
Professor:,Professor:I read something like that.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Evamparamparā-prāptamimaṁrājarṣayoviduḥ[Bg.4.2].Without thatparamparāthe knowledge is not perfect. Give themprasāda.Hm?
Professor:,Professor:You are traveling all Latin America now?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. I have traveled all over the world in eight years. Eight years? From 1967, eight years. So eight years I have traveled around fourteen times or more than that. No, twice in a year, almost."
Professor:,Professor:(laughs),Prabhupāda,"No, this time, I started from India. Then I went to Hong Kong, from Hong Kong to Tokyo, from Tokyo to Honolulu, from Honolulu to Los Angeles, and from Los Angeles here, Mexico. And then where?"
Hṛdayānanda,Caracas.,Prabhupāda,Caracas.
Hṛdayānanda,"And then Puerto Rico. Then Miami, Atlanta, New York, London.",Prabhupāda,"And then, from London, I may go directly to Bombay, or I may visit some other European cities where we have got temple. In Paris, in Geneva, inRome, in Amsterdam, we have got some temple, like this."
Professor:,Professor:What you're going to do about...?,Prabhupāda,You have seen all our books? These are our books.
Professor:,Professor:I saw them.(?) I think I had a talk somewhere with...,Prabhupāda,We have got our small and big book. Fifty books we have got. All aboutKṛṣṇa.
Hṛdayānanda,If music is important to us?,Prabhupāda,"No, first of all, our basic principle is pleasure. So whatever gives pleasure, we accept. That is natural. But in the material world, they take material pleasure, but we are for spiritual pleasure. So as soon as we speak of pleasure, there must be varieties. Without... Variety is the mother of enjoyment. So the only thing is that the material pleasure, that is temporary. It is finished after certain period, and spiritual means eternal. So our endeavor is to transfer ourself from this material pleasure to the spiritual pleasure. But the pleasure is the aim, either in this material world or in the spiritual world. This is...Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12).This is the Vedic... Our position isānandamaya,to remain in pleasure. But here in this material world, the body is temporary, and everything is temporary. Therefore pleasure is temporary."
Professor:,"Professor:You could also, I think, offer ayogasystem for...",Prabhupāda,"Yes this isbhakti-yoga.Yes,bhakti-yoga.Bhakti-yogenamanasi.Bhakti-yogenamanasi[SB1.7.4].There is a verse inBhāgavata.Realyogameansbhakti-yoga."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):The question is, well, Vedic idea that knowledge, human knowledge, is imperfect, does that not then go along... Of course, we are limited by, all time by biological limitation and so on. But this statement, that there is perfect knowledge, that it can be acquired, and that there are some people who did acquire it, that's very strong statement indeed, and my question is of the practical nature. How one can know that given source of supposed spiritual truth is an actual truth? Is there any technique how one can get to it?",Prabhupāda,"That I have already said, that you take the vibration from the Vedic knowledge and you experiment it. Observation and experiment, that is scientific. So first of all observation and then experiment. And when you are satisfied by experiment, then it is perfect knowledge."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):If I am satisfied? Can I rely that much on myself?,Prabhupāda,"Anyone can do, provided he knows the art how to do it. It is a technique also. You cannot make experiment as a crude man. You must be expert. But it is... In ourCaitanya-caritāmṛtayou'll find that there is a statement,caitanyeradayārakathākarahavicāra:""Just try to make an experiment on the mercy of LordCaitanya.""Vicārakarilecittepabecamatkāra:""When you make an experiment, then you'll be awe-full 'Oh, it is so nice.' "" So it is not to be accepted blindly."
Professor:,Professor:Can one perceive by their own senses what is that...?,Prabhupāda,"No, you have to see through the eyes of theśāstra,but God has given you the instrument by which you can make an experiment. Yes. The same thing, as it is stated... Find out that verse fromBhagavad-gītā, dehino 'sminyathādehe[Bg.2.13].[break] This is the statement. Now you make experiment. You have got physical laboratory. (laughter)"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):It would be rather difficult, I'm afraid.",Prabhupāda,"That you must know the, how it can be experiment. It is given. The example is given that... What is that? ""As the child is passing""?"
Hṛdayānanda,"""As the embodied soul continually passes in this body from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.""",Prabhupāda,"That's it. Now, this is a fact. Everyone knows that body is changing. Now, how the last body's changed? That you make experiment, how it is passing. Yes. To make experiment means you have to know the science how to make experiment. That is knowledge. You take the basic principle of knowledge, and then you make your experiment and you will know this is perfect."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Is there any direct line of division between that which you would call knowledge and that what you call religion?,Prabhupāda,"Religion, as it is passing on at the present moment, ""a kind of faith,"" this is not religion. This is not religion. According to... Religion meansdharma,the characteristic. Just like you are eating something salty, something sweet. So the sugar, the characteristic, it is sweet. That is religion. And the salt is salty. The chili is pungent. So these characteristic is religion. So you'll have to find out religion, what is your real characteristic. That is religion. Now, religion is going, ""I believe in this way."" That is another thing, sentiment. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, and philosophy without religion, mental speculation. Those two things must be combined, philosophy and sentiment. Then it is religion. (end)"

They are following oneguru, a European, it's calledBhakta(indistinct), and he's very interested to have yourdarśana.",Prabhupāda,"(indistinct) We are worshipingKṛṣṇa,Yogeśvara."
Hṛdayānanda,(Spanish) (translates throughout),Prabhupāda,"...master of all mysticyoga.Yatrayogeśvarohariḥ.What is that verse?Yatrayogeśvara, Bhagavad-gītā.Who will find out? Yes, in the last portion of the Eighteenth Chapter.Yatradhanur-dharaḥpārthoyatrayogeśvarohariḥ.I think it begins withyatra."
Hanumān,This is Mr. Coruna Cortez. He's the administrator of the Institute of Science and Education. He said he is a philosopher.,Prabhupāda,Karuna?
Mr. Cortez:,Mr. Cortez:Cortez. Arjeo Coruna Cortez.,Prabhupāda,From India?Karuna?
Hṛdayānanda,Mexican.,Prabhupāda,"Oh,Karunais also an Indian name,Karuna."

Hṛdayānanda,"He said he has studied all of Western philosophy, he's not that familiar with Eastern philosophy, and his present interest is in the philosophy of anthropology. He's interested in studying man, his body, also the spirit, how man can transcend his body, and that he has come here because he wants to learn something about the philosophy of the East.",Prabhupāda,And this girl is psychologist?
Hṛdayānanda,"She works in an institute of psychology, and she is particularly studying human conduct, why people act the way they do, and she's also interested in learning something about our philosophy.",Prabhupāda,If you have studied about the subtle body of living entity?
Psychologist:,Psychologist:No.,Prabhupāda,"First of all, this, this gross body made of five material elements—earth, water, air, fire, like that. This we can see with our eyes, but we cannot see the mind, intelligence and ego. Although everyone knows there is mind, there is intelligence. So when this body is annihilated, the subtle body—mind, intelligence, ego-carries the soul to another gross body. This is the process of transmigration of the soul. Now, what do you think of this process?"
Hṛdayānanda,"She says in her... In the field of psychology also they admit also, they admit the existence of forces beyond the gross elements, and although ordinarily they do not deal with that, she is very interested to know about it.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. This is the law. Therefore in theBhagavad-gītāit is said, ""The soul is not annihilated after the destruction of the body."" You find out that verse,najāyatenamriyatevakadacit.Read it."
Hṛdayānanda,,Prabhupāda,"So the soul transmigrates to another body. That is the evolutionary process for anthropology, basic principle of anthropology. So in Darwin's theory there is no admission of the soul. Therefore it is imperfect. The soul transmigrates from one type of body to another type. And then there are 8,400,000 forms of body. So when we get this human form of body we get all intelligence. And we should utilize this intelligence how to stop this transmigration of the soul from one body to another. So what is your opinion?"
Hṛdayānanda,(translating) If there's a certain criteria of proof or a certain evidence that we can know for certain that there actually is such transmigration of the soul?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like the baby is, the soul is, transmigrated from baby's body to child's body, child's body to boy's body, boy's body to youthful body, so the body vanishes, and because the soul remains, he gets another body. Now I am old man. I remember I had a child's body, I was lying down. I quite remember it. But that body is not existing. So this is the example. Everyone has experience. This is transmigration of the soul from one body to another. And at the time of death, the psychological condition of the mind will carry me to a suitable body, and I shall enter into the womb of my mother through the semina of the father, and the mother will give that a particular type of body, and when it is completely manufactured, then I come out and begin my again. Therefore we find varieties of forms, but in each and every form there is the soul. Now, in the human form of life, we should utilize our intelligence that ""This constant change of body, how it can be stopped?"" And we should remain in our eternal body because I am eternal, but psychologically I am simply changing different forms of body, and at the time of change of body I have to undergo so many sufferings. To remain within the womb of the mother for ten months in packed up condition, it is a very terrible punishment. But for each new birth, we have to undertake this terrible suffering. Sometimes nowadays they're being killed. So to avoid all these dangers, one should try to remain in his spiritual body so that there will be no more chance of accepting material... Find out this,janmakarmamedivyaṁyojānātitattvataḥ,tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmetikaunteya[Bg.4.9]. Hṛdayānanda: What is the purport?"
Hṛdayānanda,"She wants to know what disciplines we have, what practices we have. Also she had a misunderstanding. She said ""for the beginners,"" so I was explaining it was the same for the beginners.",Prabhupāda,"The main principle is, to understand spiritual subject matter, one must be sinless. You find that verse,"
Hṛdayānanda,"He says if to be sinless is not something more profound than simply restricting the body from some things, if there's not a more profound aspect of sinlessness.",Prabhupāda,"The body is consider... Just like if you have got high fever, you cannot act your brain."
Hṛdayānanda,You cannot?,Prabhupāda,"Act your brain. Similarly, this is also like fever, sinful fever, so you cannot act your brain for understanding higher spiritual matters."
Hṛdayānanda,"He's saying, ""What is sin, then?""",Prabhupāda,"That sin you have explained. These are the four principles of sinful life. This can be avoided. Just like these European, American boys. They were also addicted to these sinful activities, but now they have given up, and they are understandingKṛṣṇaconsciousness very nicely. Material life means sinful life. Therefore we have to act materially under regulation. Just like a man suffering from some disease, he has to live under the direction of the physician. Otherwise his sufferings will continue. [break]"
Hṛdayānanda,"I'm going to translate piece by piece so I can tell you exactly what he's saying. He's saying that he understands perfectly well that a human being should look for a way for self-control and to control the physical force within him, but there's also another dimension in the human being which is a social dimension which also has to be taken care of.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore in theBhagavad-gītāthe social dimension is described,cāturvarṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭaṁguṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ[Bg.4.13].Find out this verse. You read."
Hṛdayānanda,,Prabhupāda,"Social platform, there must be four classes of men, divisions. Just like this body is divided into four departments—the brain, the arm, the belly and the leg—so the society should be divided into four divisions: the brain division, the arm division, the belly division, and the leg division. Leg division means ordinary worker. And all of them should cooperate for keeping the body fit. If this system is followed, then the whole human society will be working very nicely. At the present moment there is no brain; therefore everything is chaotic. So ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is creating some brain. If they follow, the whole society will be happy. A man may be very stout and strong, but if he has no good brain, it is useless. Similarly, at the present moment there is education, there is money and everything, but because there is no brain, the whole thing is in chaotic condition. The first defect is, in education, that the present leader, he does not know what is the aim of life. Neither the people know that there is reincarnation or transmigration of the soul after death. They do not know. So basically they are brainless. So they cannot give guidance, and therefore the whole society is in chaotic condition."
Hṛdayānanda,If our chanting is a form of prayer?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Chanting is a spiritual method for cleansing our heart. Because all dirty things are there in the heart, if the heart becomes clean, then we can understand things as they are. The first misunderstanding, that everyone is thinking that he is this body, this is due to ignorance. So when one is cleansed he can understand that he is not this body; he is separate from the body; he lives within this body. Therefore when the person leaves this body it is dead lump of matter. So people are giving more importance to the lump of matter than to the real person within the body. Just like a bird is within the cage, the cage is being washed very nicely and no food to the bird. Therefore the bird is in disturbed condition, and he's crying, ""Khan,khan,khan,khan."" This is going on. They're giving stress on the cage, not the bird within the cage. Neither do they know that the living being is within this material body."
Hṛdayānanda,Can someone achieve self-realization without aguruor does he need aguru?,Prabhupāda,"How do you think like that? Is there anything within this you world which can be learned withoutguru? Even if you become an ordinary carpenter, you have to learn from an expert carpenter. So how you can imagine to learn the topmost subject matter withoutguru? This is... The Vedic injunction is, therefore,tad-vijñānārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet śrotriyaṁbrahma-niṣṭham[MU1.2.12],samit-pāṇiḥ,like that. We must have a bona fideguruto train us in the understanding of spiritual matter.Gurumeans who knows the thing, who can teach you. That isguru, not a humbugguru, butgurumeans one who knows.Tattva-darśinaḥ,one who has seen the truth, he can becomeguru. Find this verse,"
Hṛdayānanda,(Spanish) Thank you.,Prabhupāda,"So I have to go, bathroom. Give themprasādam.(end)"
Professor:,"Professor:(translated into English byHṛdayānanda) He says that he agrees that the goal of life is not that, but that from his childhood he's been trained in a certain way, and he has not been taught anything else, and how can he achieve a different way of life?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that we are teaching in thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, how you can change it. Therefore we asking all leading men to understand this movement and join it. That is our request."
Professor:,"Professor:There is a question I would like to ask. I do know that it is not the aim of life just to every morning keep your family, go to bed and have sex. But itispart of life.",Prabhupāda,"That I know also, everyone knows. But beyond that, there must be some aim of life."
Professor:,"Professor:But being so... I think that there is... There should be some kind of humbleness, the necessary humbleness.",Prabhupāda,"No, humbleness is of course good qualification, but the humbleness you will find in animal also, very humble. If you cut his throat, he will not tell anything. So humbleness also, that is another thing, but what should be the aim of life? What is the actual aim of life? If we forget the aim of life and simply become humble like ass, is that very good qualification? The ass is very humble. You load upon it tons of loads. It will not protest. Very humble."
Hṛdayānanda,(Spanish) He says that the goal of life is to achieve the transcendence.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, right. The goal of life is realization of transcendence. So, that they are forgetting. They have made their goal of life as sense gratification. (translated into Spanish byHṛdayānanda)"
Professor:,Professor:What kind of transcendence would that be?,Prabhupāda,Transcendence means the Absolute Truth. What do you mean by transcendence?
Professor:,"Professor:By transcendence, I understand it, the universal consciousness. The search for God.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, right you are. This life, human life, is distinguished from animal life because the animal cannot inquire about transcendence. The human life, if it is not interested in transcendence, then he is animal. If simply he is interested with the bodily demands of life, namely eating, sleeping, sex and defense, these are bodily demands of life. So if we think that ""Dog is eating on the street, and we are eating very palatable dishes, nicely made, very tasteful. That is advancement of civilization,"" that is not advancement of civilization because it is, after all, eating. Similarly, sleeping; the animals sleep on the street and we sleep in very nice apartment. But in sleeping, we dream horrible things more than the animals. So eating, sleeping, sex life and trying for defense, these are common formulas both for the animals and for the man. Therefore a human being is distinguished from the animal when he enquires about transcendence. And that is explained in the great literatureBrahma-sūtra,or the philosophy ofVedānta-sūtra,athātobrahmajijñāsā:""Now we have got this human form of life. We must enquire about theBrahman, or transcendence."" So our bodily necessities of life should be simplified as much as it is required. We must save time for enquiring about transcendence. So unless we enquire about the transcendence, then we are two-legged animals. This is culture, this is the aim of life."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He's saying that in European history many, many people, in the name of looking for transcendence, there have been so many wars, hatred between men, and, you may know, in Spain they had what is called the Inquisition where they burned so many people. And so he's saying, psychologically, that his brain tells him that in the name of searching after transcendence there has been so much bad, so how is this different?",Prabhupāda,"The difference is transcendence is beyond our mind, bodily activities, mental activities or intelligence. The European philosophers and transcendentalists, they do not know actually what is transcendence. They understand that there is something, but they do not know what it is. Therefore they speculate by their imperfect senses. Gradually it becomes craziness. Therefore you find that defect."
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):So do you mean to say that this is just a contemplative thing that doesn't really have a active influence upon the society to change the different...?,Prabhupāda,"No, we must first of all understand that our senses are imperfect. Just like we are sitting in this room. We have got our eyes, but we cannot see what is there, going on, beyond this wall. The sun is fourteen hundred thousand times bigger than this earth, and we are seeing just like a disc. So the eyelid is just near the eyes, but we cannot see what is the eyelids. If the light is off, we cannot see. So we can see under certain condition. Then what is the value of our seeing? If we, even if we manufacture telescope, that is also manufactured by the imperfect senses, so it is also not perfect. So anything understood by manipulating our imperfect senses, that is not real knowledge. So our process of understanding real knowledge is to take it from the person who has the real knowledge. Just like if we contemplate or speculate who is my father, it is never possible to understand who is my father. But if we receive the words from mother that ""Here is your father,"" that is perfect. Therefore the process of knowledge should be not to speculate but to receive it from the perfect person. If we receive knowledge from a mental speculator, that is not perfect knowledge."
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):What would be the mechanism or process to get this perfect knowledge and to purify our senses?,Prabhupāda,"First of all we have to accept this truth, that perfect knowledge can be received from the perfect person. Just like I have given the example, who is my father. You can understand it from the perfect person, mother. If somebody speculates, ""This gentleman may be your father, this gentleman may be your father,"" that is not perfect knowledge. The perfect knowledge is with the mother. Mother says, ""Here is your father."" That is perfect knowledge. Just like, therefore, in theBhagavad-gītāit is said,"
Hṛdayānanda,"""The seers of the truth.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. You have to... Just like mother has seen the father. So her knowledge is perfect. But I have not seen my father. Because before my birth there was father, I do not know who is my father. The mother has seen the father. So you have to approach such a person who has seen the truth. That is the way of... Now you have to find out a person who has seen the transcendence and receive knowledge of transcendence from him. Then it is perfect."
Professor:,"Professor:(Spanish) What I mean is that, you know. We are all imperfect because we are imperfect. Right? So how can a master, a person who really understands or who claims to really understand be able to know perfection, to see the truth, how can he with his imperfect senses...",Prabhupāda,"You are right, you are right."
Professor:,Professor:...know the real truth.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, therefore I say..."
Professor:,Professor:How can I get with my imperfect senses the perfection brought by the master?,Prabhupāda,"The same example. Just like the mother has seen the father, and the mother says not only to her son but other gentleman that ""Here is the father of the son."" So the other gentleman who has not seen the father but on the verification by the mother, he accepts the real thing. Hearing from the perfect is also perfect. If I get the chance of hearing from the perfect, then I may not be perfect, but because I have heard from the perfect, what I say, that is perfect."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He's saying that he accepts that we can receive perfect knowledge, but then because I am imperfect I make an imperfect interpretation.",Prabhupāda,"No, you are not allowed interpretation. As soon as you interpret, you become imperfect. Therefore we are presentingBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.Don't interpret. Before this, all these rascals were simply interpreting and spoiling the whole thing. So this is the fact."
Professor:,Professor:So what you really are asking for is blind faith.,Prabhupāda,"Not blind faith. Perfect man is perfect. Unless you understand that he is perfect, don't hear from him. That is blind. Without knowing that he is perfect, if you hear, that is your imperfectness. Why should you try to hear from a person whom you do not know perfectly well that he is perfect?"
Hṛdayānanda,Can I translate that?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. If you hear blindly, that is your imperfectness. You must be first of all convinced that. ""The person from whom I am hearing, he is perfect."" Then your knowledge is perfect."
Professor:,Professor:That conviction is not the product of reasoning.,Prabhupāda,"It is not convention. It is not convention. It is actually knowing that ""I have approached this perfect man."" Just like the same example: if you approach the mother of the son, she is the perfect to know the father, and if you have known from the mother that ""This boy's father is this gentleman,"" that knowledge is perfect. Even though you have not seen while the father was begotten, giving birth, it doesn't matter. But because you have heard from the mother—she is perfect—therefore your knowledge received from her is perfect. Therefore it is written,tattva-darśibhiḥ,""who has seen the truth."" So you have to approach such person who has seen the truth."
Professor:,"Professor:Well, that brings that to my original question again. How do I know who is perfect?",Prabhupāda,"That is another thing, that you have to search out such person. Otherwise your knowledge is imperfect. Now that question will be: ""How to find out such person?"" The next question will be. But unless you approach such perfect person, you cannot have perfect knowledge. That is a fact. Therefore the conclusion is that we should not speculate about perfect knowledge, but we should try to approach the perfect person and receive knowledge from him. This is the conclusion."
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He's more or less saying that in the Catholic church how they also demand the same type of faith. He said they all have a bad experience with that. And then he more or less...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, I can understand. The thing is that everyone can take advantage of this statement that ""I am perfect."" Just like so many rogues and bogus persons come. But it is your duty to know whether he is perfect. It is your duty to test whether he is perfect. That requires intelligence. If you unintelligently accept some bogus person as perfect, that is your fault. You must be assured that ""The person from whom I am asking, he is perfect."" Then you take it. Otherwise don't take."
Professor:,"Professor:Can I put a question? Why do you always say, ""From a perfect person""?",Prabhupāda,Because the knowledge must be perfect; otherwise imperfect knowledge.
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He's saying why do you say a perfect person instead of saying a perfect philosophy?,Prabhupāda,"No, unless the philosophy is given by a perfect person how the philosophy can be perfect? Philosophy means searching after the truth. So if he does not know how to find out the truth, what is the meaning of his philosophy? I was a student of philosophy. My professor was Dr. Urquhart. He used to say that ""Philosophy is the science of science."" So unless he is a perfect scientist, how he can give science?"
Professor:,Professor:I have other question. Why do we want to transcend?,Prabhupāda,I am not wanting. I am simply distributing the transcendental knowledge.
Professor:,Professor:Will not transcendence be an illusion too?,Prabhupāda,"No, no, there is proof. It is not emotion. What you say, you have no proof, but what I say I have got proof. What you say, you become your own authority. But what I say, I have got greater authority. Just like two lawyers speaking before the court—the lawyer who gives quotation from the authority, he gains the case."
Professor:,Professor:Do you have any evidence?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Professor:,Professor:Would you tell us your experiences in that field?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that, of course, it will take time for you to understand. Because unless you are lawyer, you cannot understand while the other lawyer is giving quotation. But the court will accept."
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He still wants to go on with the same question he asked before: If we are content just to purify ourselves or if we also want to help the society.,Prabhupāda,"No, you do not know what is self. How you will purify? You do not know what is self. Can you say what is self?"
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):Is it possible that he could spend his whole life trying to find himself and at the end of his life not find himself and meanwhile he didn't help the society?,Prabhupāda,"Not only one life, but millions of life, you will not be able to know—unless you change your policy."
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):What is the value of the transcendence?,Prabhupāda,Because you are transcendence. You are actually seeking transcendence because you are transcendence.
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He says that because he doesn't know what the transcendence is, there's no value for him. It's only a name. He doesn't know why to look for it.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So first of all, as I say, that you are also transcendence, you just try to know yourself first. Then you will know what is transcendence. You are the sample of transcendence, and if you see the sample, you can know the whole thing. Just like if you taste one drop of sea water, then you can understand what is the chemical composition of the sea water. Therefore your first business is to know yourself, that you are not this body. In this way, when you know yourself, then you know the original transcendence."
Professor:,Professor:Why do you make so much emphasis on (indistinct).,Prabhupāda,"Because without this, you are animal."
Professor:,Professor:What's wrong with being an animal?,Prabhupāda,Animal means you are living a very risky life.
Professor:,Professor:A very...?,Prabhupāda,"Risky life. The animal is always in danger. A dog is running, but at any moment he can be in danger. I have seen in my own eyes in New York. It is little in the off from New York. In I think in the month of December or January, a dog was jumping and he fell in the water pool and immediately died. It was so cold it collapsed immediately. So what is the use of this dog-like jumping? Besides that, in the animal society there is no question of culture, religion, philosophy, science. Animal, they do not require it. And why man requires it? That means human society is searching after the transcendence. But without knowing the way, how to understand, they are now engaged in different way. You find out this verse fromBhāgavatam,jīvasyatattva-jijñāsānayaś cehakarmabhiḥ.Find out.Kamasyanendriya-pritiḥ."
Hṛdayānanda,It's in the first volume.,Prabhupāda,Yes. You know that? Find out this verse.
Hṛdayānanda,"They still have doubts on this point that how can we know that it's worth our trouble, that if we dedicate our lives to this searching for the transcendence, how can we be sure that at the end of it we won't have wasted our lives? How can we be sure that the transcendence is actually worth searching for?",Prabhupāda,"No, first of all you must understand the importance of the business. Then we can do it. If you do not understand the importance of the business, then you cannot do it."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He says that he feels that you've already answered this question, but that they didn't catch it, that he thinks the key is that you said that the truth is not outside, but it's actually within us. We have to find it within us.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He says why do you put so much emphasis on the personalism after liberation because it seems like to him that the ideal perfect thing would be the unity rather than having something separate.,Prabhupāda,"That is your ideal, imperfect ideal. Because you are imperfect."
Professor:,Professor:Are you perfect master?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes, because I am heard from the perfect. I am not perfect, but what I say, that is perfect. Just like a child does not know what is this dictaphone, but he has learned from the father, ""This is dictaphone,"" so when he says, ""This is dictaphone,"" it is perfect. The child is not perfect, but because he has heard from his father perfect, so the knowledge is perfect."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):That if you are not perfect, how can you interpret the truth?",Prabhupāda,"Because I am giving the perfect truth. Anyone who will accept, it will act. Just like a child says that ""This is dictaphone. If you use it like this, you'll get this result."" That is perfect."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He says that not all knowledge is so objective. For example, in the matter of understanding society, the communists have their theory, the capitalists have their theory, and there's millions of theories and so...",Prabhupāda,"That is not knowledge; that is art. Just like electrician. He knows how to mix the two wires and bring the current. That is not knowledge; that is a business or art for temporary recreation. And because he knows the art how to bring the current, it does not mean that he knows the Absolute Truth. So people are taking at the present moment electrician as the knower of the Absolute Truth."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He's saying that he thinks that the knowledge that you're giving is perfect because it is perfect knowledge and not because you are giving it. Because it is revealed knowledge, perfect because it is revealed.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Anyone can take it. Just like we are giving knowledge of theBhagavad-gītā.So theBhagavad-gītāis open for everyone; it is not for me only. It is for you also. That is our movement, that you take the perfect knowledge and be happy and make your life successful."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):So he said one thing is to understand theoretically the knowledge, and the other is to practice it. What is the method for...?",Prabhupāda,"Everything is there. All questions solved, economic, social, religious, politics, whatever you are-plus transcendental knowledge."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He said it seems to him that this involves a retiring from ordinary life, western life, and even maybe retiring from ordinary eastern life.",Prabhupāda,"It is not the question of western life or eastern life. The life... Just like westerners, they eat, and the easterners, they eat. Now the question is how to supply eating. [break]"
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He's saying that the way we dress, our whole way of life, will make our movement only available to a few people because it requires someone who is prepared to completely change his way of life.",Prabhupāda,"Well, when there is question of knowledge, only you will find a few people to get the knowledge. When you put this question, ""Find out some learned scholar,"" generally they will be very... Their number will be very little. But one thing is that if there is one man in real knowledge, he can give the..., distribute the knowledge to many. The example is just likeekaś candras tamohantinacatārāsahasraśaḥ:If you get one moon at night, that is sufficient to dissipate the darkness. And there are millions of stars—it is useless. So it is necessarily not required that everyone should be in perfect knowledge. But if one man is in perfect knowledge, hundreds and thousands can hear from him and they can perfect(?). So it does not depend on the quantity; it depends on the quality."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He's saying that just like you give the example of the dictaphone, but it seems like if he just recorded the knowledge within his brain and then repeated it, that he would just be like an instrument, and he might not really be conscious of the knowledge himself. He'd just be transmitting it. It seems like... He thinks that's a defect because he's not really, he might not be conscious.",Prabhupāda,"No, he doesn't require. Just like I am working with this dictaphone. I am not a mechanic, but my business is going on. That is required. I have read the instruction paper, that ""You use this microphone like this. You put this button,"" and three, four instruction. So I have learned it and it is giving my business. That's all. Just like this lamp, the instruction is ""Push this button,"" (flicks light button) and it will go, all on. So I know I will get the light. Now I am not electrician. It doesn't require. That much knowledge is sufficient. But I want the light. So the electrician says, ""Just put this button in this way. Light will be there."" So my business is finished."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He's saying that for example he could listen to everything that you were saying, and then he could repeat it, and someone might say to him that ""Oh, you are an expert. You are a master,"" but actually he's not. He's simply repeating.",Prabhupāda,"No, this is example. By receiving a knowledge, you must corroborate by your knowledge or by your experience, by the method. Just like in theBhagavad-gītā,it is said thatArjunawas declining to fight in the war. SoKṛṣṇasaid that ""You are simply lamenting on this body, but you do not know what is the active principle of the body."" So this you can understand very nicely, that everyone is working for this body, but nobody knows what the active principle of the body. Without the active principle of the body, this body, alive or dead, is the same thing, lump of matter. SoArjunaacceptedKṛṣṇaas teacher; therefore He is chastising him that ""You are talking like a learned man, but you are lamenting on this body, but no learned man laments on this body, either dead or alive."" Because without the knowledge of the active principle which is moving the body, what is the use of simply understanding the bodily construction? The medical science knows the construction of the body, anatomy, physiology, the bone, this muscle, the blood and everything, but he does not know what is the active principle. When the active principle gone, they cannot repair it. So there may be vast advancement of medical science, but if the medical science cannot check birth, death, old age and disease, then what is the use of it? It may have some temporary use, but actually it is not science. Nobody wants to die. Is there medical science which can stop death? So that knowledge may be temporary, beneficial, but ultimately, it is not the knowledge. I am anxious for not dying. Nobody wants to die. This is my anxiety. And where is that science, medical science? So we are satisfied with some temporary knowledge. We have no ultimate knowledge. And because it is very difficult subject matter, we have avoided it very carefully."
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He does not see... He is disappointed because he does not see any difference betweenHareKṛṣṇaand all the other religions.,Prabhupāda,"That's your business, but we find difference. And we have no also difference with other religion. Now, other religions, they are also searching after God. But religion, conception of religion, without God is not religion. Do you admit or not?"
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):All the religions say they have knowledge of God.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Anyway, religion means searching after God."
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):He says for example they have a new god which is money.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, because you are imperfect, therefore you are thinking like that. Now, suppose you are on deathbed, can money save you? Then why do you say money is all-powerful? God is all-powerful, but money is not all-powerful. Then therefore money cannot be God."
Professor:,"Professor:Does religion or God, can give you eternal life?",Prabhupāda,What is that? What he says? He says money is God.
Professor:,"Professor:No, I am not saying that. People down here...",Prabhupāda,"People are rascal fools, what is the value of their knowledge? Therefore knowledge, man of knowledge required."
Professor:,Professor:There are many religions that have no God.,Prabhupāda,"Religion cannot be many; religion is one. If anyone says there are many religions, that, he does not know what is religion. Just like science: two plus two is equal to four. It is equally applicable everywhere. You cannot say that ""To the Christian two plus two equal to five,"" the ""Christian science"" or ""Christian mathematics."" That you cannot say. Science and mathematics is the same everywhere. If God is one, therefore knowledge of God should be one. There cannot be two."
Professor:,"Professor:No, that's ideally, but is not so.",Prabhupāda,"You hear. Because you imperfect, you have so many things. But we hear differently."
Professor:,Professor:I know that there is only one God.,Prabhupāda,"We say that God is one. Whether you accept it or not? Unless God is one, there cannot be God. God cannot be many. God means, in the dictionary it is said, ""Supreme Being."" The Supreme Being can be one. If there is competition of Supreme Being, then he is not Supreme Being. That is the philosophy. That is the philosophy. Then we have to find out who is that Supreme Being. You cannot say... You find somebody who has got little power. You cannot say, ""Now here is God."" The supreme power, that is God. Just like money, that is also one of the qualification of God. But money, He has got all the money. You may have got some money, some millions dollars. I may have got little more than that. But nobody can say, ""I have got all the money."" Or one can say that ""I have got all the money,"" then He is God."
Hṛdayānanda,They want to hear the translation.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):Is the final goal of transcendence, then, immortality?",Prabhupāda,All perfection.
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):Then what would that be then? What would that be, that all perfection?",Prabhupāda,"That is transcendence. You come in contact with the transcendence, all-perfect. Then you become all-perfect."
Professor:,Professor:Is God perfect?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, otherwise how He is God? He is dog."
Hṛdayānanda,Professor (Hṛdayānanda):They want to know: is God the transcendence?,Prabhupāda,What is the transcendence? Find out the meaning.
Hṛdayānanda,"I can read it? First I'll read it in English. To transcend... It only has the word transcend. ""Go beyond...""",Prabhupāda,"Not ""to,"" the verb, I mean to say, transcendence. So find out the noun."
Hṛdayānanda,Noun is not here.,Prabhupāda,Not here?
Hṛdayānanda,"But I can change it into the noun. The transcendence: ""That which goes beyond, that which exceeds the limits, rises above."" And also transcendence means ""that which transcends ordinary limits, the supreme, the preeminent."" So I'll translate it.",Prabhupāda,"This is the meaning is there, that our mind, our bodily activities, our words, they are all limited. They are all limited. Do you accept or not?"
Professor:,Professor:By time.,Prabhupāda,"Whatever it may be. It may be by time. Suppose a child, he can say, ""I am now foolish for the time."" But he is foolish at that time. That is not argument, that this child expects to become an M.A. That does not mean he can say he is M.A. at that time. So you cannot make time. Unless you are perfect in knowledge, you cannot say that you are in knowledge. Time, everyone has got the chance. In time he will be in perfect knowledge. That is not... There is no disagreement. But so long he is imperfect, he must admit that he is imperfect. Now, a businessman, a small businessman, he is trying to become millionaire, and if he says, ""I will become millionaire in time,"" that does not mean he is millionaire. He must first of all become millionaire. Then he should claim."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):If he accepts that he is imperfect, what experience qualifies him to talk about God?",Prabhupāda,"That I have already discussed, that you have to go to the perfect and take his experience. And then, gradually, you become a perfect."
Hṛdayānanda,"Professor (Hṛdayānanda):So then everything would be an act of faith, simply to believe.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no, not believe. You just corroborate it with your experimental knowledge, and you will find it is right. Just likeKṛṣṇasays that..."
Hṛdayānanda,He says that in order...,Prabhupāda,"No, he wants to say something."
