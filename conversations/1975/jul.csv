Brahmānanda,"One friend of the temple, one man, he has purchased it at a very high price, and he has lent it for your stay. These glasses are bulletproof.

Brahmānanda,"He has in Florida, Key Biscayne. He had two homes, one in Florida, one in California. But now he's staying in Florida. Recently he went to New York and testified before a committee. It's the first time that he has spoken publicly since his...",Prabhupāda,What is that committee?
Brahmānanda,They were investigating the Watergate.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. Oh, he had to present himself."
Brahmānanda,Yes. It's the first time any ex-chief executive has ever testified.,Prabhupāda,So he is not out of danger.
Brahmānanda,"Well, they're still investigating the whole thing.",Prabhupāda,"But I heard that he made a condition that he will no more be bothered. On this condition, he agreed to resign. [break] ...India the trouble is dissention between IndiraGandhiandJayaPrakashNārāyaṇa. So thatJayaPrakashNārāyaṇais fasting, I have heard."
Brahmānanda,That gentleman said. The doctor said. He's seventy-nine years of age.,Prabhupāda,Seventy-nine?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. Is there any danger to us from her arresting so many people?,Prabhupāda,No.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Now she has clearly indicated that she is like a dictator. Otherwise how could she arrest...,Prabhupāda,So both of them are in distressed condition. I am thinking of writing them aboutBhagavad-gītā.Do you think it is advised? They can...
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:I think Nixon would be more inclined to read it than Mrs.Gandhi. Because she already has rejectedHinduculture.,Prabhupāda,Who?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Gandhi. I mean, she always turns towards the Muslims more.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, she hasguru. And she is going occasionally to Anandamayi."
Brahmānanda,"Yeah, thatguruhas spoken highly of our movement. In Germany there was an interview of him in one German magazine, and he was asked about all different types of groups. And most of the groups he criticized, but our group he gave his recommendation, theHareKṛṣṇamovement.",Prabhupāda,What did he say?
Brahmānanda,"I don't remember exactly, but he stressed the importance of the chanting of themahā-mantra.He said ""It is an important means for God realization, and by doing this, one can achieve love of God, and they are spreading this all over the world.""",Prabhupāda,"So what do you think? Shall I write? Hm? I have made a draft of letter this night. So you come and see. Let us take a chance. We want actually good for everyone. And this is the only medicine,HareKṛṣṇamantra.For any problem.Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.People are suffering. If herguruhas opined like that, then she may take some attention. Then it appears thatguruis to some extent nice."
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,She gave interview to our men.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:I saw her twice.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, you saw? How did (s)he talk with you?"
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:She was very respectful. And she wished our movement well.,Prabhupāda,Ācchā?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:She said that she had difficulty to take an active part, because then she would have to take an active part in all such movements.",Prabhupāda,Hmm. That's it. That is the difficulty. She said frankly.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. Because we asked her to attend the cornerstone ceremony at Māyāpur.,Prabhupāda,"So, shall we take a chance?"
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:I think it might be nice.,Prabhupāda,"All right. Then write two registered letters, one toJayaPrakashNarayana... [break] ...astrologer, who was telling me?"
Bhāvānanda,"Oh, Mr... In Svarūp Gañj there's one big astrologer. So he saw your photograph, and he said, ""This is the face of the most powerful spiritual personality on the planet.""",Prabhupāda,(laughs)HareKṛṣṇa.
Devotees:,Devotees:JayaPrabhupāda!,Prabhupāda,At least I desire so. [break] Where your preaching was going on?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:We were preaching in Berkeley, California. Our other parties are spread out all over the country. One party is in Massachusetts, another party is in the South, southern United States.",Prabhupāda,Where in Massachusetts?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Amherst area. Then another party is in Michigan, another party in Illinois, another party is in Washington, in the state of Washington. There's a couple of others.",Prabhupāda,So his parties are working more. And book selling is going on?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Oh, yeah. This past month we sold nearly five thousand big books.",Prabhupāda,Oh?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:And about 120,000Back to Godheads.",Prabhupāda,"So you are surpassing, what is his name?"
Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:...a bus now, so he's going to compete by making new devotees and expanding his ranks. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...competition amongst thegopīs,who can satisfyKṛṣṇamore. In the spiritual world there is also competition. [break] ...two parties, one, Rādhārāṇī's party, and one, Candravāli's party. (Car horn honks) Come on. (laughs)"
Brahmānanda,They were saluting us.,Prabhupāda,Outsider?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:When we distribute these books, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we think that it is you who are distributing them, that they are your books, and we are simply assisting to offer them to people. It is actually you who are doing all the preaching.",Prabhupāda,"It is Kṛṣṇa's book, we are all servants, engaged. [break] (laughing) Here your parents accusing me, and in India thecastebrāhmaṇasaccusing me. My standing... I do not know what is my standing. Your parents are accusing me, ""This rascal, converting our sons to become mendicant without any material enjoyment."" And there, ""This rascal is giving sacred thread to themlecchasandyavanas."" (Still laughing)"
Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:Is that why you keep traveling, Prabhupāda, so they won't catch you?",Prabhupāda,"NāradaMuniwas accused byPrajāpatiDakṣathat ""You are traveling in the dress of asādhu,but you are the most sinful man. You have turned my sons in the renounced order of life to become beggar, without any advancement, without any enjoyment."" So that accusation is always there, beginning fromNāradaMunidown to us. Some parents came to demonstrate?"
Bhāvānanda,In Laguna Beach they also.,Prabhupāda,Therefore Dr. Judah has said...
Brahmānanda,"He has dedicated his book, ""To the parents and to the devotees.""",Prabhupāda,He has tried to pacify the parents.
Brahmānanda,Yes. Another parent is coming to see you today.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, to accuse me? (laughter)"
Brahmānanda,"No, her son said she is very favorable. She's the mother ofParīkṣit.",Prabhupāda,"Your mother was very angry upon us. (laughter) You know that? When she came to see me, I told, ""Mrs. Bruce, can you give me some money?"" (laughing) (Imitating angry woman's voice:) ""I have given you two sons!"" (laughter) She was very angry. ""Still you want money?"" (laughter) ""And that's all right."""
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:You asked them to bow down to her?,Prabhupāda,"No, I asked him to bow down to your mother."
Brahmānanda,"Yes, at initiation.",Prabhupāda,After initiation.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Did she like...,Prabhupāda,"I gave her proper respect. Mother, after all, she is. She is fortunate mother. She has produced such nice sons. And I offered her respect, yes. Any of your mother and father, they are all very fortunate. And you are doing... giving the best service to your family. Our Nitāi's mother came. She looked very nice lady, yes. I think you are the first child."
Nitāi,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore she looks young, not very old. Within forty?"
Nitāi,"Over forty, I think. Within fifty.",Prabhupāda,Oh. But she looks younger. And your grandmother?
Nitāi,She is eighty.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. [break] ...DakṣaaccusedNāradathat ""My sons were not out of the three kinds of debts."" One debt is debtor to the saintly sages. Just like we are readingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,we are indebted to Vyāsadeva. He has given such literature, and we are taking advantage of it. As such, especially thebrāhmaṇas,they have got indebtedness to big sages and saintly person. They receive knowledge from them. And they are indebtor to the demigods. Therefore they have to performyaj&#241as.And they are indebtor to their father because the father has brought them to this world. So in this way, especially abrāhmaṇais indebted to demigods, the past sages, and the father. So the indebtedness to the sages is performed by becomingbrahmacārī,and to the demigods by offering sacrifices, and to the father by begetting children, to continue the progeny. SoNāradaMuniwas accused that ""You keep them indebted to these principles, so how they can be liberated? Simply by dressing like you, (laughs) a mendicant?"" Accusing. But perhaps he did not know. There is another version in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,"
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Sometimes when we're readingBhāgavatamabout theprajāpatis...They are such exalted persons.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. They are no ordinary person."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yet sometimes they behave in such a way that is...,Prabhupāda,"That is... After all, they are living entity, conditioned. They are also conditioned. They are not liberated."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They're not pure devotees.,Prabhupāda,"No. They want enjoyment, material."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Still, they're entrusted with very big posts.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:But LordBrahmā, he's aprajāpati.",Prabhupāda,He is the chiefprajāpati.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Isn't he a pure devotee?,Prabhupāda,No.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:And yet he composed theBrahma-saṁhitā.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, he is devotee, not to the topmost extent."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Sometimes we hear that LordBrahmāincarnated as ṬhākuraHaridāsa.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Sometimes devotees say, ""Then how come he's the head of oursampradāyaif he's not a pure devotee?""",Prabhupāda,"It doesn't require. He is a devotee. That's all right. There are grades of devotee, but on the whole, a devotee is very exalted person. Just likegopīs.Nobody can be compared with thegopīs.There are so many grades of devotees, but they are ultimate. And amongst thegopīs,Rādhārāṇī. So there is no comparison, no more... EvenKṛṣṇais defeated there.KṛṣṇabecameCaitanyaMahāprabhuto understand the devotion of Rādhārāṇī. That isCaitanyaMahāprabhu. [break] (About something by the path:) ...queen. Elizabeth? No. Queen or king?"
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Allegorical.,Prabhupāda,Allegorical?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:All, women. [break]",Prabhupāda,...imperson.
Brahmānanda,"Cupid is there, and it is marked ""love.""",Prabhupāda,"Oh. [break] (ToHarikeśa, who has been coughing throughout:) ...not taking any medicine?"
Harikeśa,No.,Prabhupāda,This continuing is not good.
Harikeśa,"I stopped eating anything but fruit, and that's what I did. [break]",Prabhupāda,...examined your chest?
Harikeśa,No.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, you should examine your chest. Some congestion in the lungs. [break]"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Śrīla Prabhupāda, around our society now there are many devotees who are following different kinds of diets. They read some book and they get some idea. They follow...",Prabhupāda,This is not good.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:And one of the things I see about the unique feature of all the diets that they have in common is that the devotees more or less stop taking theprasādamwhich is offered to the Deity.,Prabhupāda,This is not good. [break]
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:It seems to me that one of the important aspects ofbhakti-yogais to depend uponKṛṣṇafor one's maintenance.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:So whatever is offered to the Deity, one should accept.",Prabhupāda,Theprasādamis not suitable?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Well it is standardprasādam. Capatis,rice,dahl, subji,fruits.",Prabhupāda,So why they do not like?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Well, they are reading these books...",Prabhupāda,And becoming influenced.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,This is nonsense. This should be stopped.
Sudāmā:,"Sudāmā:A lot of devotees, they take these fasting for twenty days, thirty days, fasting.",Prabhupāda,That means they are manufacturing their own way of life. That's not good.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:One of our best devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he recently left our association. And one of the... I know the biggest reason is that he was fasting completely from almost all foods for thirty days.",Prabhupāda,"But fasting is good. If one can fast, that is good. That istapasya."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. But see, they read these books in addition.",Prabhupāda,"Fasting is not bad. If one can fast, that is very good."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Total fast, you mean?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yadubara:,Yadubara:I remember in Los Angeles...,Prabhupāda,That is great austerity.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yeah, I wanted to point out to you that the results...",Prabhupāda,"No, artificial... Just likeRaghunāthadāsaGosvāmī, he was fasting, but he was not weak. That fasting. And he who will fast artificially and become weak, ""I cannot work,"" that is not required. That is calledmarkaṭa-vairāgya.If you fast and at the same time you do not become weak, then that is recommended. And after fasting you cannot do a flat, fall flat, then what is the use of fasting?RaghunāthadāsaGosvāmī was fasting, but he was taking thrice bathing and offering obeisances hundred times. His regular activities was not stopped. And he was taking every alternate day a little quantity of butter. That's all."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:So we cannot imitate his position.,Prabhupāda,That is not possible. We have to work.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. One of the important things about takingprasādamis that all the devotees sit together. It is actually a very spiritual activity. Just like inCaitanya-caritāmṛta,the feasts...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. That is recommended, that we are following. But now it is not following?"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Well, I have to say frankly, I have seen now that in many... I don't want to get into mentioning any names, but some devotees are preaching this.",Prabhupāda,"Preaching? Who is that nonsense, preaching."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Well, RevatīnandanaMahārāja.",Prabhupāda,He is a rascal.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:He is preaching like this.,Prabhupāda,"He is a rascal. He is becoming rascal, day by day. Stop him doing these things."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:And he's influencing other people. The whole temple in Laguṇa Beach, they were doing this.",Prabhupāda,"Then, what can I do? You are all GBCs."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Now that we know, we'll take action.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Revatinandana is becoming less and less spiritually. He had good potency, but he is losing that."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):You said that if we fast and we can't do our work and we become weak, than this is not so good.",Prabhupāda,"This is not good, ""not so"" not, absolutely bad."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):So, our devotional service comes first?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):So if there is, let us say there is grain and rice being offered to the Deities, and one finds that if he eats this, his service is impaired. Like so many times I've seen, practically myself if I overeat grains in the summertime, I drive around doing my service and I'm falling asleep.",Prabhupāda,Then which foodstuff suits you?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Fruits are more... they keep me more active.,Prabhupāda,"So you take fruit. Fruit is also offered to the Deity. There are varieties ofprasādam.So whichever suits, you can take. Anything artificial is bad."
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Los Angeles they are charging money for theprasādam,and we find that it's cheaper to buy our ownprasādamand offer it ourself.",Prabhupāda,Hm?
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:They are charging money in Los Angeles for theprasādameach meal, so we find it is cheaper to...",Prabhupāda,Prepare your own?
Yadubara:,Yadubara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,So you do that.
Yadubara:,Yadubara:75c for noonprasādamand 50c for breakfast.,Prabhupāda,"So if you can prepare cheaper, you can do that."
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:You mentioned before that it is better that we not do so much cooking. If everyone is separately cooking, then that is such a time-consuming thing for everyone.",Prabhupāda,"But you said that ""If we cook, it is cheaper."" Then? If it is cheaper, convenient, then you cook. I said that ""You save time. Don't cook."""
Bhāvānanda,"During Māyāpur festival, Śrīla Prabhupāda, nicest thing was when we allsatdown together and tookprasādam.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bhāvānanda,"Five hundred devotees, it was nice, spiritual activity. And everyone took what was given.",Prabhupāda,So what is the difficulty? I do not find. [break]
Bhāvānanda,"...the tongue, I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]",Prabhupāda,"Capati,rice is innocent food. What is the difficulty?"
Bhāvānanda,It's nice.,Prabhupāda,"Over and above, there is fruit."
Harikeśa,"A lot of devotees are quoting you that... they say that there is no need to eat grains, that you said grains were for the animals.",Prabhupāda,I am...
Harikeśa,I tell them that.,Prabhupāda,"Rascal, they say, ""Prabhupāda says."" And you believe that. [break]"
Bhāvānanda,"...I think the people are spoiled. If they go to India, they see that here they're turning down rice; there the people are dying for lack of rice.",Prabhupāda,Where?
Bhāvānanda,"In India. And here they're saying, ""Oh, I don't want this and don't want that. I don't want this grain, that grain."" But in India people are dying for want of food. Here they're so spoiled. [break]",Prabhupāda,"...Kṛṣṇa's position. If He does not supply grains, then He is accused. And He supplies grains, then He is accused. (laughter)"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:...those scientists came to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and even said milk was no good.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:That is what they say in these books on health, these health books. They say that cow milk is no good.",Prabhupāda,Ācchā?
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:No, some of them, most of them don't say that. It's very contaminating to read those and to follow.",Prabhupāda,Therefore follow takingprasādam.Let whatever may happen.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:That's the best thing. Let us die eatingprasādam.,Prabhupāda,Yes. (laughter) That is devotee.
Sudāmā:,"Sudāmā:Because in the beginning, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you encouraged us, all of us, to take muchprasādam,to our full satisfaction.",Prabhupāda,Yes. I say still.
Brahmānanda,Me too.,Prabhupāda,The diets are not good or you are not good?
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):I think that's for maintaining the right depth to the lake. I think they have a pump house down here, and they maintain the depth of the lake by these things.",Prabhupāda,Water is supplied or...?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):In Denver here we have many businesses going on for you. And we are out engagingkarmīsin helping us retrievelakṣmī.We are going to them forlakṣmīin so many ways. How is it that this engages them, or does it engage them in Kṛṣṇa's service? Do they make any benefit?",Prabhupāda,What they are doing by doing business? They aregṛhasthasdoing business?
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Yes, but the devotees are maintaining the business. And I myself go out and talk to rascals all day long, demons,mlecchas.Am I engaging them in Kṛṣṇa's service by takinglakṣmī?",Prabhupāda,What you are doing with the money?
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):I'm giving it to the temple president so that we can buy a farm for you.,Prabhupāda,"No, if you are engaging the money forKṛṣṇa, then it is all right."
Brahmānanda,He's asking about is there any benefit to thekarmīsthat he deals with because he engages in business activity with them? Do thekarmīsget benefit?,Prabhupāda,Yes. To some extent they are helpingKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement.
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:They also have this program in Pittsburg, the same thing. They come to the temple and manufacture jewelry.",Prabhupāda,"Svakarmaṇātamabhyarcya.It is mentioned in theBhagavad-gītā.You can see there. Everyone can work, but the result of the work should go toKṛṣṇa. [break]"
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):...lakṣmīfrom them so we can engage them more in Kṛṣṇa's service.,Prabhupāda,"Provided you engage them for Kṛṣṇa's service. Otherwise thelakṣmīwill kill you. Just likeSītā,SītāisLakṣmī.WhenSītāwas taken byRāvaṇa, the result was the whole family was killed because they did not useSītāfor Rāma's service. [break] ...householders can be engaged, not anyone else."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:So my question is: Supposing half of those men that are in our movement are householders. Would it not be more beneficial that everyone engages in preaching work, or is that impractical?",Prabhupāda,"Preaching is for thesannyāsīs,for thebrahmacārī.And householder, because they arebrāhmaṇas,they can be engaged in Deity worship and also earning money."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Business.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:So it's not more practical to earn money by preaching?,Prabhupāda,"If preaching, by preaching we can get money, why should we go to thekarmīs?"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Because you wrote me in a letter that so far as you are concerned, you think that your books are enough to maintain the society.",Prabhupāda,"I think so. But if they think that by doing some other business, they will get more money, then what can I say? This is very good business. Yes. We are preaching, at the same time getting money."
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):We have found in our experience that some kinds of men do better in doing business. They feel more satisfied in collecting money in that way forKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,That's all right. But that money should be used forKṛṣṇa.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Yes. Different kinds of men have to be engaged in different ways. Otherwise they become dissatisfied.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. ThereforeKṛṣṇasays,svakarmaṇā.Anyone, he likes to do something, that is hiskarma.But by thatkarma,he can serveKṛṣṇa.Svakarmaṇātamabhyarcyasaṁsiddhiṁlabhatenavaḥ.Saṁsiddhimeans perfection. [break]"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):...in our preaching work we will be able to maintain our temples, and with our business activities, we will be able to expand and buy all these farms, do so many things.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. If it is favorable, do it, business.(?) Therefore we have made program: 50% must come toKṛṣṇa, at least.Jaya.HareKṛṣṇa. [break] (In car:)"
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:...because that many people are involved.,Prabhupāda,"Dieting, the best thing is to takeprasādam."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Definitely. It's clear cut. My only feeling about...,Prabhupāda,"And if our... Pushed on our men... The thing is they supply more spices, and especially that mustard. This is not good. This is prohibited."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:It should be mild,prasādam.",Prabhupāda,"Practically no spices. Simply little cumin. And this turmeric. Turmeric you get from India, whole turmeric. This powdered turmeric is very, very bad."
Harikeśa,They put sawdust in it.,Prabhupāda,That's all.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:It's very unhealthy.,Prabhupāda,It is very cheating. Any powdered spice is not good.
Harikeśa,Asafoetida also.,Prabhupāda,"Everything. As soon as it is powder, they will mix with all rubbish things. And it is very easy to cheat you. You are susceptible for being cheated. So they take advantage and cheat you. So best thing is to import spices from India whole and either get it powdered or during time of cooking you make them paste. That is first class."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Crushing.,Prabhupāda,"You just put the spices water, soaked in water for some time, and then in mortar and pestle you..."
Dhanañjaya,Smash it.,Prabhupāda,"That is very nice. And immediately you fresh prepare and put into the vegetable. It will be tasteful, and it will be beneficial. All spices are beneficial."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:And much cheaper.,Prabhupāda,"Cheaper, of course, there is no question to you what is cheaper. For you everything is ""damn cheap."""
Harikeśa,TheRādhā-Dāmodaraparty has very goodprasādamprogram. Thishalavāthey make every morning—everyone is fully satisfied.,Prabhupāda,They are sane men.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Every morning we have...,Prabhupāda,So why do they not follow your principle?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Ah, it's very... And the devotees love it. Every day, Prabhupāda, we...",Prabhupāda,"No, every temple give them example, invite them in yourprasādam."
Harikeśa,I noticed the devotees would wait forprasādamwith great...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is nice. It requires good leader, that's all. [break] ...Kṛṣṇawe must prepare very first-class foodstuff, and where is the complaint if it is first class?"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:It's all a concoction. Certain devotees have concocted. They have taken advice from other masters, food masters, what to eat, what not to eat, all concoction. It's clearly written inBhagavad-gītā,those foods which are sattvic-juicy, fatty. Everything is mentioned there.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Guide them. [break] ...here the main business is slaughterhouse.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Cow country, it's called. They call it that. On the highway you see that, ""Cow country.""",Prabhupāda,Chicago is also this...
Brahmānanda,There's one area of the town that there's a bad odor.,Prabhupāda,"Here also they say. Just like in Bombay, the Bandra(?)."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:What's Viṣṇujana doing? [break] ...Deity, I've never seen it. He gets up early in the morning, wakes Him up, cooks for Him, then we offerārati,then bathing and dressing the Deity, sings for Him all day. He's so devoted toRādhā-Dāmodara.",Prabhupāda,"Svarūpa-siddhi,arcana-siddhi.By simply worshiping Deity one can become perfect.Arcana-siddhi."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:That's a great advantage of our bus. Now we just traveled for two days in a row fromSanFrancisco, but we did not miss oneārati,we had sixāratis,fullprasādam.We took bath on the bus in our shower room. We had regular classes,kīrtanaall day. It was undisturbed.",Prabhupāda,So why not one week with them? I am prepared. (end)
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,So bullet expected also? (laughs)
Brahmānanda,"All great leaders, they live in constant fear.",Prabhupāda,"Bhayaṁdvitīyābhiniveśataḥsyāt.Everyone, animal up to the king of heaven—always fearful.Ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithunaṁca.So fearfulness is one of the qualification of conditioned soul. Yesterday you were putting forward the logic, ""Machine."" Machine, we also accept. InBhagavad-gītāit is mentioned, this body is machine,yantra.Yantrameans machine. So at the same time, you said, ""Growing."" Do you grow machine Ford car?"
Ambarīṣa,"Do they grow? No, they... (laughs)",Prabhupāda,"Then how the analogy is perfect? Machine it is. That is accepted.Kṛṣṇasays. That is undoubtedly, it is machine. It is nothing but machine. So machine, at the same time, he says, ""It grows."" How it can be comparable?"
Brahmānanda,The body is compared to a machine.,Prabhupāda,"Not... It is machine, not compared. It is machine. Actually it is machine."
Brahmānanda,But then it cannot grow because a machine does not grow.,Prabhupāda,No.
Ambarīṣa,So it is changing every second.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like this is a car, machine, but if I want a bigger car, that means another car, not this car is growing. Suppose sometimes you get baby car. That is not sufficient. I want big car. So you cannot say that increase the baby car and it becomes a sedan car. That means you require another big car. A child, a child cannot have sex in that body. The same child, when he wants to enjoy sex, he must have another body. So these rascals, they cannot understand how different machines has been supplied by nature. It is supplying."
Ambarīṣa,"Yes, I think it's...",Prabhupāda,"As soon as you want another machine, immediately it is...Svābhāvikībala-kriyācaparāsyaśaktir vividhaiva.His potencies, his merit, is acting. Not his merit, means the nature's merit,prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāni[Bg.3.27],it is working so swiftly. You cannot see. The same example as I give always, that the movies spool, each is a different picture, but when it is put into the projector, you cannot understand. But actually on the background there are different pictures. So if ordinary cinematograph, cinema picture, we can make like that, how much nicely and subtle machine is there, it is being done—that you do not know. But each body, each second, you are being supplied a different body."
Brahmānanda,Like each of the different frames.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Brahmānanda,On the film each frame is different.,Prabhupāda,Is different.
Brahmānanda,Each picture. But what appears to be a complete...,Prabhupāda,"So in one picture you will find hand is here, another picture hand is here, another hand is here, but when they are taken together, it means the hand moves. The example is there. Each picture is a different picture. As soon as you stop it, the hand is here. That's all."
Ambarīṣa,So each second the body is a little different?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Each second the body is different. But what this rascal will do? How they will know? They have no brain. All dull-headed materialistic,mūḍha.They cannot understand this. But this is the process going on. I want, for certain thing, I want a different body. Immediately nature supplies."
Yadubara:,Yadubara:Even within this body?,Prabhupāda,Why within? Another body you cannot see. Not within—without. Another body supplied.
Ambarīṣa,"Sometimes when people are put into a dangerous situation, they acquire extraordinary strength, just like that, that they never had before. So it's like they...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. You must expect according to your quality. Just like ifKṛṣṇawants, He can make something else. But you are not independent. You are dependent on nature, and your position is very insignificant. ButKṛṣṇacan, as soon as He wishes—immediately done.Parasyaśaktir vividhaiva.Just like in Bible it is said, ""God said, 'Let there be creation.' There was creation immediately."" But you cannot do that. But if you... Whatever you are desiring, nature is supplying you.Kṛṣṇais also being supplied by nature, that is spiritual nature. And you are also being supplied by the material nature. So both nature is working.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ,ahaṅkāra...[Bg.3.27]. Each stage is a different form. That is going on."
Ambarīṣa,The scientists say that every seven years the body...,Prabhupāda,Not seven years. A medical man says every moment the blood corpuscles are changing.
Ambarīṣa,Are different?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. New blood cells are coming into being. So you cannot say machine growing. That is fallacious. A machine, new machine. (Everyone gets out of car)"
Ambarīṣa,"New machine,jaya.",Prabhupāda,"As soon as I want a smaller car, not smaller car, I want bigger car, smaller car also. That is change. Whatever you deserve. You desire; at the same time, you deserve. First deserve, then desire. Just like these rascals, ""I desire to become God."" That kind of desire will never be fulfilled."
Yadubara:,Yadubara:It's according to the qualification also.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Your position is very minute. So you can desire up to that limit, not that you can desire ""I become complete, universal."" That is the defect of theMāyāvāda. ""Because I am equal...So 'ham.Because I am qualitatively one, therefore I am one in every respect."" A drop of ocean water, if he desires, ""I become ocean,"" that is not possible. But a drop of ocean water contains the same ingredients as the big Pacific Ocean. So in your quantitative proportion, if you desire, that is your perfection."
Brahmānanda,Understanding one's position.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Like in the Tenth Chapter it's talking about...,Prabhupāda,"Hm, not come very near. Yes?"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):It's talking about thatArjunasaw the universal form, all these universes and all that. So does that mean like you were talking that one can't become a universal being, but he can see the whole universe. Can you explain how that is?",Prabhupāda,"How is that? You can see the universe; that does not mean that you can become universe. You can see the sky; that does not mean you become as big as sky. [break] ...small, minute shining sparks, minute combination. So they are also shining, but that does not mean they can become as good, as big, as the sun.

Brahmānanda,That means it is relative.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Everything is relative. Therefore it is called relative world. [break]
Brahmānanda,"It's according to the body. Because the duck has a particular body, the water for him is safety, and because we have this particular body, it is dangerous.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):[break] ...true that when you become more purified that you will see everything differently with your eyes and hear everything differently with your ears and all this?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):We won't see things the way we perceive them now, right?",Prabhupāda,"If you are suffering from cataract, how you can see distinctly? You have to get your eyes operated. Then you can see. So ourbhaktiprocess is simply purifying, purifying, more, more, more. When you are completely purified, you see God face to face, eye to eye, talk with Him, play with Him, just like cowherds boys, they are playing, thegopīsare dancing. You get that position. [break]"
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:...You said in theBhāgavatam,speaking aboutDhruvaMahārāja, that his senses became enlivened.",Prabhupāda,"Senses are there. It is purified.Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁtat-paratvenanirmalam[Cc.Madhya19.170].Thebhaktiprocess is completely, complete process to purify you. Other process are not.Karma,jñāna,yogacannot purify you cent percent, butbhaktiprocess can purify you cent percent."
Harikeśa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, what's the difference between a Brahmavādī and aMāyāvādī?",Prabhupāda,That you already questioned. We answered.
Harikeśa,I did?,Prabhupāda,Yes. [break] ...vādīmeans those who are aspiring to merge into the impersonalBrahmaneffulgence.
Harikeśa,"And Māyāvādīs, they do not attain that impersonal realization?",Prabhupāda,Māyāvādīs remain fools forever.
Harikeśa,They never leave this material platform.,Prabhupāda,"They do not know. They have no knowledge.Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ[SB10.2.32],always impure. Otherwise how they are thinking,so 'ham:""I am same. I am God. I am moving the sun, I am..."" Such rascals, they remain always in ignorance.

Harikeśa,The Brahmavādīs have some possibility of advancement?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Harikeśa,What is that thing that enables them to advance?,Prabhupāda,That you will know later on. First of all try to understand this. Don't try to understand everything in a moment. That is foolishness. [break] That argument is clear?
Ambarīṣa,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"That if you call it a machine, how the machine can grow?"
Ambarīṣa,The machine is changing at every second.,Prabhupāda,"You say two things: ""Growing"" and ""machine."" So that is incomparable. Machine cannot grow."
Brahmānanda,"...many machines. You get another machine, another one, and another and another.",Prabhupāda,So I have changed so many machines. So death means another machine. Where is the difficulty?
Ambarīṣa,"When the spirit soul leaves the body, the body continues to change, it deteriorates?",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Spirit soul is changing machine. That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā.So when this machine is finished, and another machine."
Ambarīṣa,"The old machine continues to change after the spirit soul leaves, it deteriorates? The old machine deterior..., it breaks down.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. You give up one machine and you take another machine. [break]"
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):...one goes into a subtle machine?,Prabhupāda,"That example is given,vāsāṁsijīrṇāniyathāvihāya[Bg.2.22].Just like your dress, when it is useless, you throw it away and take another dress.

So you require a different dress. Then you begin another satisfaction of your desires. This is going on.Karmāṇadaiva-netreṇa:[SB3.31.1] by yourkarma,you are creating a situation. Just like the criminal, he has created a situation; he cannot live anymore outside the jail. ""Come on, here."" He will go in automatically. So they do not know how nature is working.

Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):OnlyKṛṣṇais doing everything then.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Kṛṣṇais not like you that when you are given some business, you become embarrassed. That is the difference betweenKṛṣṇaand you. He never becomes embarrassed."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it true that our advancement in devotional services... Is it influenced a lot by our pastkarma,how many sinful activities we have committed?",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no.Bhaktiis not underkarma.Bhaktiis under your good will. If you accept to surrender toKṛṣṇa, you can do that without being checked by anything else. Simply you have to will, ""Yes,Kṛṣṇa. You are asking me. So long I did not do. From this day I do.""

Devotee (4):,"Devotee (4):...consciousness part of this life, up to the time of death, in our next life we will be put in a situation immediately where we can take upKṛṣṇaconsciousness again or will we have to sufferkarmabefore we came intoKṛṣṇaconsciousness?",Prabhupāda,You will getKṛṣṇaconscious again.Yoga-bhraṣṭaḥsañjāya... Śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgeheyoga-bhraṣṭaḥsañjāyate[Bg.6.41].AKṛṣṇaconscious person will be given all comforts of material life so that he may regain without any botheration.
Yadubara:,Yadubara:Sometimes it is stated thatKṛṣṇawill take everything away from the devotee.,Prabhupāda,"That is special favor, (laughter) that ""This rascal is again attached. Take all his..."" That is special favor. That is not ordinary favor, so that when everything is taken away, he will completely surrender toKṛṣṇa, ""Kṛṣṇa, I have nothing except You."""
Kuruśreṣṭha,Once one performs devotional service then he can't get away fromKṛṣṇa. Can he still get away? It seems like...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that option is always, because you are independent."
Kuruśreṣṭha,"I see with myself that if I try to get away a little bit, He beats me so much that I have to come back.",Prabhupāda,Yes. That is special favor.
Yadubara:,Yadubara:SoKṛṣṇais directly controlling that?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. When He sees, ""That fool wants Me, at the same time, material world. So take his material possession, everything, so that he will want only Me, that's all."" Actually, it was done to me. (laughs) I have got practical experience. I did not want to takesannyāsa.I thought that I shall do business. AndKṛṣṇaforced me to takesannyāsaand all, everything, dismantled."
Yadubara:,Yadubara:But your business was successful...,Prabhupāda,"I was thinking of becoming Birla, but I am now more than Birla. This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy."
Brahmānanda,Birla gives you money now.,Prabhupāda,"Not only that, how many branches Birla has? It is an example, yes."
Devotee (4):,"Devotee (4):Śrīla Prabhupāda, if a devotee gets sick, should he go and take medicine?",Prabhupāda,Better not to take.
Devotee (4):,Devotee (4):Just depend onKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is very good. What is this?"
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:You said the other day, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that we should take care of disease if it comes. CāṇakyaPaṇḍitawas also saying fire and so on.",Prabhupāda,That is material consciousness.
Brahmānanda,Fasting is one way of eliminating the disease without taking medicine.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. There is a Indian proverb that ""Disease and unwanted guest, if you don't give food, they will go away."" If some guest has come whom you do not want, don't give him food. Then he will go away. (laughter) Similarly, disease, if you fast, it will go away. [break] ...another story:prahareṇadhanañjaya.One gentleman had eight or nine daughters and son-in-law. So when they came, he was giving them good food and shelter, everything. So then they saw, ""We are very comfortably living at father-in-law's expense."" So they did not want to go. The father-in-law saw, ""It is very dangerous that all the son-in-laws are not going."" Then he began to... First day he did not supply salt. So one son-in-law say, ""Oh, they are now disrespecful, they have not given salt."" So one went away. And next day, something else, something else, something else, shortened, shortened. So those who were intelligent, they went away. The last one, he was not going. Then his brother-in-laws thought that ""Give him good beating."" Then he went away.Prahareṇadhanañjaya.Others, those who were intelligent, they, when they thought that ""Now there is disrespectful dealing, they are not giving everything,"" so they gradually... The last one, he was a rascal. He was beaten severely; then he went away."
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:So if we're beaten by this material nature, then we'll go away.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Yes. No, material nature's business is beating and kicking. That's his only business. But we are so fool, we are taking, ""Oh, very nice kicking."" That is the disease. We accept the kicking as very nice. That is foolishness. We are suffering always by three kinds of...,ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika,ādhidaivikadisturbances. There is disturbance in the body, in the mind, disturbance by other living entities, so many, disturbed by climate, disturbed by famine. Always disturbance. Still, we are thinking, ""It is very nice place."" This is foolishness. Still, we are trying to improve it. That is foolishness. He does not think that ""What is the meaning of improvement? The disturbing is always continuing."" That does not come to his brain. They are making improvement. [break] ...improvement, they can say, ""This is improvement."" But how long this improvement will go? If there is no rainfall, what this improvement will help? So that is not in your hand. That isādhidaivika.It depends on the demigods. If they want, they can stop completely, no rainfall. Then what this improvement will do?"
Brahmānanda,There'll be no water for their machines.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So they are thinking that ""This is improvement."" What is this nonsense improvement? You are dependent fully on other elements. What improvement will do? AndKṛṣṇasays, ""This is a place for misery."" How you will improve? This is folly, this is illusion.Kṛṣṇasays, ""This place is for suffering,"" and you are making improvement. ""Yes, we are advancing. In future we shall live. Nobody will die."" Therefore they are called rascals. Persons who are trying to do something which is impossible, they are fools.Mūḍha.They do not see, still, they hope, ""Yes, we are trying. We shall do in future."" This is going on. This is the example by the ass. The ass... Driver is sitting on the back of the ass and showing one bunch of grass, and the ass is thinking, ""I will get it."" (laughter) And he is going on, and he is sitting safely, that ""The ass will go on."" So our improvement is like that. ""Just little forward, then I shall get the grass."" He will never get the grass. That he has no brain, that ""I am improving; the grass also improving, going on."" That they do not see. Now we invented so many airship. It was thought, ""Oh, now it will be very nice. Within two hours we shall reach somewhere."" Now there are so many dangers. Now there is problem, how to protect us from these accidents."
Brahmānanda,Now they have too many airplanes.,Prabhupāda,Too many airplanes. So where is the improvement? Improvement means to die altogether two hundred men at a time. This is improvement.
Kuruśreṣṭha,They are trying to create a plastic body with plastic heart transplants and plastic liver. They feel that as soon as they can replace all the breakable parts with replaceble ones...,Prabhupāda,That is a Frankenstein? (laughter)
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:They're very persistent, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,That is the foolishness. Fools are very persistent.
Brahmānanda,"I was reading that in order to go to the moon, it took ten years and the cost was 25 billion dollars.",Prabhupāda,Just see how foolish they are. And again they are trying.Punaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30].Chewing the chewed. This is their business. Horrible civilization.

Ambarīṣa,"They are always trying to look for the bright side, but there is no bright side.",Prabhupāda,"Just like north of Sweden, there is no sunrise?"

He will have to die. So where is your bright side? [break] ...for preparing?"
Brahmānanda,For the moon? 25 billion dollars.,Prabhupāda,So again I am trying to go another planet. Where is the guarantee that it will be successful?
Brahmānanda,"On the contrary, if they failed once, then we should think that they would fail again.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is animalism. A dog is coming, and you show him some stick or beat him. He will go away for the time being. Again he will come. That is dog. He doesn't get lesson by one. Therefore it is calledpunaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30].Repeating the same thing again and again. That is animalism."
Yadubara:,Yadubara:They actually think that they were successful.,Prabhupāda,"Unless they say, how they will adjust so much money spent? What account they will give? They must bluff, ""Yes, it is successful."" I saw in the Allahabad high-court. One man was condemned to death. I told you?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So one barrister, Mr. Allston, he was pacifying, ""Don't worry, I shall appeal and get you released. Don't worry."" (laughter) I heard it.

Viṣṇujana:,"Viṣṇujana:Oh yes. They are used for taking cargo up and down the coast. They don't travel in the ocean, but they travel on the coast. They used them during the Second World War all over the United States.",Prabhupāda,Such boat does not drown?

Mayor:,"Mayor:No. I know about the article on the crime and I have it at home, but I have not read it as yet. But we certainly know that it's a tremendous problem in the United States, perhaps throughout the world and certainly here.",Prabhupāda,"It is not a problem. Just like there is disease, and there is remedy also. And as much as the disease is chronic, the remedy is also costly. So in the western countries—do not mind—they are not trying to educate first-class men, and that is the difficulty. This advancement, technical knowledge, to have nice motor cars or big, big buildings, highways, this is very good, but this is not the aim of life."
Mayor:,"Mayor:No, material things should not be.",Prabhupāda,"They are missing the aim of life. That is the... The aim of life is, an..., not according to Vedic, but anyone, the aim of life is how to realize God. That is aim. In the animal life or in other lives less important than the human being there is no question of God realization. In the human life, the civilized human life, there is religion. It doesn't matter whether one is Christian or aHinduor a Muslim or a Buddhist. These are the principle religions of the world. So any civilized man must be inquisitive to know what is the original source of everything. That philosophy is there. It is calledBrahma-sūtraorVedānta-sūtra.Perhaps you have heard the name,Vedāntaphilosophy.Vedameans knowledge, andantameans end. In the materialistic way of knowledge they did not find any end, and they accept it ""That this is progress."" But one must come to the end of the knowledge, what is the ultimate knowledge. So generally they are missing what is the ultimate knowledge. We are searching after knowledge in so many ways but what is the ultimate knowledge? The ultimate knowledge,Vedānta, means end of knowledge. End of knowledge means to understand the original source of everything.Athātobrahmajijñāsā.The human inquisitiveness should be up to that point, what is the origin of everything. Because human life is not a spot. That... The western people are lacking that understanding. We are thinking that this duration of life, say, for fifty to a hundred years, that is all. No. That is the first instruction in theBhagavad-gītā,that this body is not everything. We have to accept another body after death.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].As we are accepting different bodies in our this span of life from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youthhood, from youthhood to old age... So this is the example. And after this old age, after this body is useless, then I accept another body. And again another chapter of life begins. And on my next life, next body I am creating,kāraṇaṁguṇa-saṅgaḥasya,infection. Just like if I infect some disease, I am creating that disease. If I infect smallpox disease, then I must develop that disease. How it is, subtle way, working, that we cannot see. But if somewhere I have infected some disease, somewhere it will be manifest. It will manifest. You cannot check it. So in this material world there are three qualities: goodness, passion, and ignorance. So as we associate, we develop a type of body. So these crimes means they do not get good association. Naturally they are developing. And now these boys, they are also Americans and Europeans. They are getting good association, and they are becoming free from all bad habits. We generally take bad character on the basis of illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling."
Mayor:,Mayor:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So they were habituated to all... Because that is a system in the European, American life. But now they are free. That is Professor Judah's remark in his letter. Have you got that? Yes. He has written one book,HareKṛṣṇaand Counterculture,about our movement. He has read all our books. Here are, you have shown all these books? So he appreciates, many gentlemen appreciate, even the priestly class, they also appreciate. So this is a movement which is trying to create at least a section to become first-class. The first-class man does not mean that he is nicely dressed or very rich or very opulent. Generally, of course, a first-class man means good parentage, good education, good looking and nicely rich. That is the standard. But... That may be first-class position, but first-class man is different. First-class man means he is self-controlled, in the mind he is undisturbed, he is truthful, he is very clean, inside and outside, he is very simple, tolerant, full of knowledge, practical application of knowledge, and believe in God. This is first-class man. There is no mention that he is rich, he is beautiful, bodily, or he is educated. Educated, this is a result of education. Real education means that he is self controlled. Controlling the mind, controlling the senses, truthful. He will speak truth in any circumstances. Even to his enemy he will speak the truth. And clean, and very simple, tolerant. And any knowledge, he has got some, I mean to say, strength over it. Ultimate knowledge,Brahmān, he believes in that and he has...Brahmajanātītībrāhmaṇaḥ,This is first-class man. So it is not expected that everyone will become first-class. but there must be a section in the society, ideal first-class. And they will be advisor to the rest. Thesebrāhmaṇas,they will not take part in politics, but those who are politicians, administrators, they should take advice from these first-class men, how to rule, how to control, what is the ideal. So the ruling class, they are calledkṣatriyas.So find out this verse,śamaḥdamaḥ..."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:You want about thekṣatriyaor thebrāhmaṇas?,Prabhupāda,"Brāhmaṇa,kṣatriya."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:,Prabhupāda,This is first-class man. And the second-class man?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:,Prabhupāda,That is second-class. And the third-class?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:,Prabhupāda,"They are not cattle raising, that was..."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Cow protection.,Prabhupāda,"Cow protection. It has to be corrected. It isgo-rakṣya, go.They take it cattle-raising. I thinkHayagrīvahas translated like this."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Hayagrīva.,Prabhupāda,"No, it is especially mentionedgo-rakṣya.Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁvaiśya-karmasvabhāva-jam[Bg.18.44].And then...?"
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Paricaryātmakaṁkarmaśūdrasyāpisvabhāva-jam.,Prabhupāda,"And to serve under somebody, that isśūdra.So at the present moment people are being educated to serve under somebody. Technology, one is very expert in some particular line of technology, say, computer machine... You know how to operate. It is a big qualification. But unless he gets a job under some big establishment, he is useless. He cannot live independently. The first-class man will live independently. The second-class man also will live independently. And the third-class men, they will also live independently. And those who cannot live independently, they are fourth-class men. So at the present moment we are simply creating fourth-class men. So fourth-class men, they are prone to be degraded. If you don't raise them to become first-class, they must degrade. So that is the position of the present civilization. They are creating all fourth-class men, and gradually they are degrading. So now you should take up very seriously how you can create some first-class men. First-class, second-class, third-class also. If you simply remain in the fourth grade, technology... Technology means he has to serve under somebody. This industry, that is also the same thing. Hundreds and thousands of men are working. They are fourth-class men. Andśūdra.Just like formerly in Indian village... Still there are. They are self-supported. Suppose there is a blacksmith. If you require some black iron instrument, you go there and he will prepare immediately. Say, an oil crusher, extracting oil. So weaver, self-supported. Now these things have been taken in larger scale. That is called industry. But actually these things are meant for theśūdras,fourth-class men. So the problem is that if we keep men fourth-class or increase only fourth-class men, so these things are automatic, the resultant action. Therefore, in the western countries especially, everywhere, all over the world, the attempt should be how to create first-class, second-class. At least these two classes required: good politicians, administrators, and good advisors. So this program we are placing before the world. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. So I would suggest that in your country you are resourceful. You can take up this movement very seriously. And it is not expected that cent percent of the population will become first-class, but there must be ideal groups of first-class, second-class, third-class and the rest, fourth-class. That is required."
Mayor:,"Mayor:It takes a great deal of discipline to try to achieve these ideals, and that's one thing that seems to be difficult these days, especially in young people, to have any sense of the need for discipline at all.",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Jagadīśa,He says young people today have no sense of discipline. They don't know what it means to be...,Prabhupāda,"How they can be? They are not trained up. They are not trained up from the very beginning. For being trained up, there is another four divisions,brahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,sannyāsa.These are the training divisions. So for the first-class, second-class, third-class, all the students, they are trained up asbrahmacārī,student life.Brahmacārīmeans celibacy, live under the direction of the teacher and accept all kinds of hardship under the teacher's or spiritual master direction. Children, they can easily take it. If a child, a small child, I ask him, ""My dear child, you take my shoes and keep it there,"" he will immediately agree. He has no sense, ""Oh, he is asking me to take his shoes."" He will immediately agree. Even he is very rich man's son. So this life is advised that a student live just like a menial servant of the teacher or the spiritual master. And they agree. We have got good instances. And he is coming from the first-class family,brāhmaṇafamily orkṣatriyafamily orvaiśyafamily, first, second, third. So evenśūdrafamily, he can learn also. Sobrahmacārī.Then he is, if he can remain without wife or without opposite sex, then he continues to remain asbrahmacārī.He is encouraged. This process encourages to remainbrahmacārī,that ""Don't take to sex life, it is entailed with so many difficulties. Practice to remain abrahmacārī.You'll save so much trouble."" But if he is unable—the teacher sees-Then he is allowed to marry, marriage. If he is trained upbrahmacārī,when he marries, he lives with wife under rules and regulation, not like cats and dogs. And then, because he had previous training, at a certain age he gives up family life. That is calledvānaprastha. Pa&#241ca&#347;ordhvam <a href=""/d/vanam"" class=""d"">v&#257;nam</a> <a href=""/d/vrajet"" class=""d"">vrajet</a>.</span> The <span class=""Italic"">v&#257;naprastha</span> life is accepted, generally, after fiftieth year, not earlier. Then the husband and wife travels all over, I mean to say, spiritual sanctified places. In India there are so many places. So in this way, there is no sex in the <span class=""Italic"">v&#257;naprastha.</span> Simply the wife remains as assistant. And she also practices austerities. And then the husband, when he is fully mature, he sends wife back to his elderly children to take care of her and he takes <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</span> So this is spiritual advancement, and in <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> life, one is absolutely dedicated for the service of God. So in this way his life becomes perfect. And according to his perfection, he gets next birth in higher planetary system. In the upper planets, planetary system, there is Svargaloka up to the third-class man. And then, above that, there are Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapaloka, Satyaloka, Brahmaloka. And beyond that, there is spiritual world. So in this way life becomes perfect. If you want, you can go to the spiritual world. Spiritual world means no more accepting this material body. And so long we are in this material world we repeat one body after another. And if we degrade ourself to become criminals, then we degrade to the hellish planets down this universe. So human civilization means by nature's way, by evolutionary process, he has come to this body of human being. He should now decide that whether he should remain in this chain of birth and death or he should get out of it and go to the spiritual world. This training required. So throughout the whole world there is no such institution to study all this fact. They are going just like fourth-class men. They have decided out of their own accord that there is no life after death. Young men say that there is no old age, but nature will not agree. Your next life is old age. That is natural. You cannot say, ""No, no, I don't believe in it."" You believe or not believe, it will come. Similarly, you believe or not believe, your next life is there. That is described in the <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> Find out.</div>

They will read these books... They are practical examples. I am poor Indian, I did not bribe them neither I have money. (laughter) So now they have dedicated their life for this purpose.

And I have no necessity. I require a little clothing and two <span class=""Italic"">capatis.</span> That's all. Anyone can bring. I thought Chicago is one of the important cities of your country. And when I first came, I saw this is vacant. So I thought if this house can be utilized in the beginning and we invite anyone, especially young men, come here, live with us at least for one week and associate with this chanting, dancing, and we give nice <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/prasadam"" class=""d"">pras&#257;dam</a>.</span> There is no difficulty.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Oh, yes. We invite. As soon as they have got a leisure hour, let them come and live with us for one week and see the result. They can remain forever. It doesn't matter. But for experimental sake they can come, live with us and associate with us. It is not difficult. And we invite everyone. We have no such discrimination that black, white, <a href=""/d/hindu"" class=""d"">Hindu</a>, Muslim, Christian, no. Anyone. It is universal. Because we consider every living entity is part and parcel of God. That is a fact. We are teeny gods, part and parcel. The same quality we have got&mdash;in minute quantity. Quality is the same, quantity is less. So God is good, so we are also good. But we have become bad under circumstances. Just like under infection, one becomes diseased. So if we cure that infection, again he becomes good. So it is the curing process. It is not an external artificial thing, imposed upon somebody, no. His goodness is there. Just like generally a man is healthy, but by infecting some disease he becomes diseased. So this material way of life is a kind of infection. So we have to cure that. And this is our process. And it has become successful. So therefore this problem of your country... I was this morning also lecturing that ""You take up this movement very seriously and save your country."" And if you save America, means you save the whole world because others are following America. So you can do it very easily. That is my appeal to the authorities of the American administration. But I do not want anything. For your countrymen, for your misguided youthful generation, you have to do it. That is my request. Otherwise there is no other way.</div>

But as far as religious organizations are concerned, some of them are 70, 80% effective in cases that have been attempted cure.

They have to learn all these quality. Just like the first-class men, they are being trained up in self-controlling, controlling the mind, controlling the senses. And these second-class men, they should be trained up how to fight. Because fight will there be. We do not place this bogus idea that there will be no fight. No. Then fight will be there so long the human society is there. But what for one should fight? That training should be there. Not unnecessarily. In the history of India we find there were two fights: one with <a href=""/d/ravana"" class=""d"">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> and another the <a href=""/d/kuruksetra"" class=""d"">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> fight. [break] Not at the whims of the leaders. He has got some idea and declare war and engage people. He is safe, now the people are dying. Therefore these leaders, this administration, they require to be guided by the first-class men. So everything will be possible, provided our, this heart is cleansed.

Then everything will be automatically done. So my request is that if we get some encouragement from the authorities, we can push this movement little more vigorously. Otherwise we have no source. We simply sell our books, and whatever we get by that, we maintain ourself, we publish again books, or we open new center. There is no encouragement from the authorities.

So if the government authorities give us facilities for this business, that we hold mass <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sankirtana"" class=""d"">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</a>,</span> <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and give them little <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/prasadam"" class=""d"">pras&#257;dam</a>,</span> then we are sure the whole place will change.</div>

Man can be turned to be a religious man, the dog cannot be. That is the difference between dog and man. So if you keep the human society to the status of dogs and cats, how you can expect peaceful society? If you bring one dozen of dogs and if you want to keep them peacefully, is it possible? So if we keep human society as dogs, then how you can expect peacefulness?</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> No, it is not my religious belief. I am just giving you general description of religious life and animal life. The animal cannot be taken to the churches and teach something about God. It is not possible. But a human being can be. So if the human being is refused this facility, then you keep them as cats and dogs. And you cannot expect any peaceful condition of life in the society of cats and dogs. So therefore it is the duty of the authority, of the government, of the elderly person, father, guardian, to teach the subordinate how to become God conscious. Otherwise, there will be trouble because there is no difference between dogs and man in every respect. The dog eats, we eat. The dog sleeps, we sleep. The dog have sex, we have sex. The dog also tries to defend itself, we also try to defend ourself. These are common factors. The only difference is the dog cannot be instructed about his relation with God, but man can be instructed.</div>

At the present moment the human society does not know what is the meaning of religion. The meaning of religion is to abide by the laws of God, just like a good citizen means who abides by the laws of the state, of the government. Because we have no understanding of God, therefore we do not know what is the laws of God, and therefore we do not know what is religion. That is the present status of the human society. They are forgetting religion. They take religion as a kind of faith. Faith may be blind faith. Faith is not the real description of religion. Religion means the laws which is given by God, and anyone who follows the laws, he is religious. It doesn't matter whether he is a Christian or a <a href=""/d/hindu"" class=""d"">Hindu</a> or Muslim.

Otherwise, Indian mass of people, they are fully conscious of God and they try to follow the laws of God, the mass of people. Here even the big, big professor, they do not believe in God, they do not believe in next life. But India, even the poorest man, he knows that ""There is God. There is next life. If I commit sinful life I will suffer. If I live piously, then I shall enjoy."" Even the low-grade society, social man, he believes it. Still if there is some disagreement, the village people go to the temple for settlement, and the opposite parties will hesitate to speak lies before the temple, still. So in that respect India is still 80 percent religious, 80 percent religious. That is the special privilege of taking birth in India. That is a fact.</div>

<A NAME=""413319""></A><div id=""413319""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> The answer is... Then we come to the details. So you say, ""Christian,"" and I find to find out a Christian. I find difficulty to find out one Christian. I must frankly say, because the so-called Christians, they do not abide by the <span class=""Italic"">Bible's</span> order that in the Christian's <span class=""Italic"">Bible</span> it is said, ""Thou shall not kill."" and where is a Christian who does not kill? So this can be effective only persons who are practicing religion. So these persons, they are trained to practice. So their chanting of the holy name of God and others' are different. [break] It is not simply a rubber stamp position. It must be practiced, realized. This chanting of holy name by our men who are trained up and the same chanting by others will be different. Of course, if you... [break] ...your <a href=""/d/hindu"" class=""d"">Hindu</a> principle. That is secular state, not to remain callous: ""Whatever you like you can do. We have no concern to see."" That is not government's duty.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Lt. Mozee:</span> Sir, isn't the difficulty, rather, that the group of, I want to call them, hard-<a href=""/d/core"" class=""d"">core</a> group, the priests, the devotees, the followers, the little circle of people, have always been the ones that have followed the practices, but the fringe... Assume for example that <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> grew to gigantic proportions as Christianity has grown. Would not it be the problem that the fringe areas, the ones who were not, who professed to be the followers... Would not they be the difficulty as the Christian is today? You have said that you...</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes, that possibility is always there. But my proposal is that if you are not true Christian, then your preaching will not be effective. I don't say that now we are strictly following and we will not fall down in future. I don't say that. That fall down propensity, tendency is always there. But my proposal is that unless one is strictly follower of the principles, his preaching will not be effective. That is my charge.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Lt. Mozee:</span> Yes. Well sir, again I thank you for your time. I thank you for this interview. And I thank you for the opportunity to find out more about the group that is <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. And I will deliver this tape recording to my superiors. Hopefully, hopefully it will be effective...</div>
