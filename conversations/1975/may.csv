Amogha,"In verses like this one, when there is the multi-use of one word, like the wordātmāis mentioned here to refer to four potential meanings. Sometimes professors and some scholars argue on the point, how do we know which one of the meanings is used in this verse?",Prabhupāda,"Any one you can take, and it will be explained."
Amogha,So any of the four meanings is also the same true meaning.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Amogha,"Sometimes they claim that we should not claim that our choice is the true choice, but they don't understand that any of those meanings can be true at the same time.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, this body is true. We have got body. We don't say it is false. It is true. Bodily pains and pleasures we feel, so how can I say that the body is false? The body means bodily pains and pleasures, then we are affected, so how you can say it is false? Similarly the mind, and soul is absolute thing. Factually. So any item you take, you can understand by thorough study."
Paramahaṁsa,"In some cases, in a more controversial case, the word chosen, or the meaning chosen for a particular Sanskrit word, may change the whole meaning of the verse, but because...",Prabhupāda,"Therefore you have to take theparamparāmeaning. Because we are foolish, we cannot understand properly.Tadvijñārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet.Therefore, one has to go toguruand understand the meaning byparamparā.You cannot make your own meaning. The meaning is already there. But if you cannot understand, then you should approachguruand understand the meaning byparamparā."
Paramahaṁsa,"Sometimes people ask where Swami Prabhupāda get his meanings for different words, because they would differ, they would disagree and pick some other word. But they don't know that you are simply taking the verse and the meaning of the words word for word, as the previousācāryashave done.",Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇasays. You take that meaning. Where is the difficulty? You do not know, and neither you accept Kṛṣṇa's words. Therefore you remain foolish. You foolishly... First of all you do not know, you are imperfect. And one who knows, you do not take his words. Then you remain foolish. What can we do? What is the answer? You are foolish. So you have to know from others. When we say that you take from others who are perfect, then you will not take. And you are foolish, so remain foolish. What can we do? Hmm?"
Paramahaṁsa,"Sometimes people ask, though, they say, ""Why is it that even among theācāryassometimes we find there is a difference of opinion?""",Prabhupāda,"They are notācāryas.They are notācāryas.There is no difference of understanding betweenācāryas.What Madhvācārya understands, we also understand. Suppose you are present also. So there is no difference. What Rāmānujācārya understands, we also understand. WhatCaitanyaMahāprabhuunderstand, we also understand. So where is the difference? Difference should be that the fact that he is notācārya.As soon as he differs from the previousācāryas,that means he is notācārya.Otherwise there is full agreement between all theācāryas.Just likeKṛṣṇais the Supreme Person, allācāryasagree. Where is the difference? Does Rāmānujācārya differ from Madhvācārya, or Madhvācārya differ from ŚrīCaitanya,Caitanyadiffers from—no. There is no difference. That isVaiṣṇava. All the Vaiṣṇavas understand thatViṣṇuis the Supreme. There may be, sometimes, such asKṛṣṇais understood as incarnation ofViṣṇu, and sometimes they understandViṣṇuas the incarnation ofKṛṣṇa. That issampradāya.That issampradāya.But eitherKṛṣṇaorViṣṇu, He is Supreme, that is accepted by all."
Paramahaṁsa,So that point is not so important whetherKṛṣṇais coming fromViṣṇuorViṣṇuis coming fromKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is not important. Because, actually both of them the same, the Supreme. That example we give that candle, two candles, that so far the power of lighting is concerned, both of them equal. Now, you may say this is first candle, I say if it is first candle. But so far the power is concerned, there is no difference of opinion. If I love somebody, I'll say he is first. And if you love somebody, you'll say he is first. But both of them same. Just like devotees, some devotees are very... Hanumanji, he'll never acceptKṛṣṇa. And thegopīswill never acceptRāmaorViṣṇu. So far theKṛṣṇaandViṣṇu, they are all the same. What do you think?"
Paramahaṁsa,"I think perhaps (indistinct) So actually the differences, whatever little differences may arise, those differences amongst theācāryas,they are due to different feelings of love forKṛṣṇaor His manifestations.",Prabhupāda,"You'll find in some, among some devotees, they will criticize, ""Why you are worshipingRāmacandra? He could not save even His wife."" (laughter) And some will, ""Ah, you are worshipingKṛṣṇa. He was so fond of women."" Like that. InVṛndāvanayou'll find they are different. Somebody will say, ""HareKṛṣṇa,"" another will say, ""SītāRāma."" There will be competition. There is not difference. Both of them know that either I worshipRāmaorKṛṣṇa, They are the same."
Amogha,"Śrīla Prabhupāda? Here it mentionsBrahmān, and as I understoodoṁkāra...My question is whetheroṁkārais a representation...",Prabhupāda,"There is no question aboutoṁkārathere. Discuss on the verse. Butoṁkārais alsoKṛṣṇa.Praṇavaḥsarvavedeṣu. Raso 'hamapsukaunteyapraṇavaḥsarvavedeṣu[Bg.7.8].Kṛṣṇasays, ""I ampraṇavaḥ."" Sooṁkārais not different thanKṛṣṇa. Butoṁkārais pronounced by the impersonalists. That is the difference.Kṛṣṇa, when He says that ""I ampraṇavaḥ,I amoṁkāra,"" then where is the objection? They foolishly say thatoṁkārais better thanKṛṣṇa. There is no need of chanting ""Kṛṣṇa."" That is not good. But so far we are concerned, we say there is no difference betweenoṁkāraandKṛṣṇa. Other systems, Christianism or Buddhism or Mohamedanism, they have got one book,Koran, Bible,or... What is the Buddhist scripture? One book. And we have got so many, dealing with the same subject matter. So which is better? Higher mathematics, or two plus two? They should understand the gravity of this movement, my presentation of books. They haven't got so many books. Two thousand years past, the Christian religion has got only one book,Bible.And their only pastime of Christ is crucifixion. There is the cross. Therefore it has become hackneyed. People are no more interested. Neither they can explain very nicely. Neither they follow strictly whatever little information they have. Then?"
