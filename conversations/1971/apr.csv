Guest:,"Guest:Divine birth is not... There's no known being, super-being, here to... Here you find Vietnam War, you find here Bangladesh, you find all suffering and they'll cry all around to God that ""He will come and protect us,"" and there is no protection anywhere from this.",Prabhupāda,"Well, this kind of protection, crying at the time of danger, this is experienced from past history also. Just like in the last war in Germany. One German friend told me that naturally all the women went to the church for praying, ""My Lord, save my husband. Save my brother."" Because all men were in the front, only women were left. So they were praying that ""My husband may come back. My brother may come back,"" or ""My father may come back,"" but nobody came back, and they thought, ""Oh, there is no God. Our all prayers are useless."" They became atheist."
Guest:,Guest:Then that God should come.,Prabhupāda,So God is not your order-supplier.
Guest:,Guest:They became atheist...,Prabhupāda,"God is not your order-supplier. You create war and pray to the church. Why you create war? Precaution is better than... Unless youKṛṣṇaconscious, then you will...Tenatyaktenabhuñjīthā[Īśomantra1].You will encroach upon other's property. Thatpāpa-bījahas to be killed. Now, after creating war... What is the use? After creating war by your own fault, if you go to the church and pray God, ""Please save me,"" so who wanted you to create this war? They are creating their wars, and they are making God as order-supplier: ""Now I have created war. Please stop it."" Why? Did you do it by the sanction of God? So they must suffer. How can you make God as your order-supplier? You create something by your own fault and you ask God to come and save you. What is your answer? That is... That is, means,sva-karma-phala-bhuk.You have created something: you must suffer for that. You have created some disease: you must suffer it. Why you violated the law of nature and created your disease? Is it not a fact that when you eat, overeat, and you have got so many troubles in the stomach, then you must suffer for some time. You have created that disease."
Guest:,"Guest:But (indistinct) women, children, they are different. (indistinct) After all, they have not done anything.",Prabhupāda,"Well, when there is war, that thing happens everywhere. But the persons who create war, they are responsible for it.Yadāyadāhidharmasya.First of all we have to understand."
Guest:,"Guest:What can I say? Then only whensādhusare attacked, then only...?",Prabhupāda,"No, no. You quoted fromBhagavad-gītā;I am replying fromBhagavad-gītā.You quoted fromBhagavad-gītā,so your answer should be given from theBhagavad-gītā.You told me thatKṛṣṇaor God comes when there is such and suchadharma,so what isadharma,what isdharma,who issādhu—these things should be understood. But generally, this movement is to createsādhus.So you have to give time. You have to cooperate. This incarnation ofKṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇaandnāma,Kṛṣṇa's name, is the same.Abhinnatvaṁnāma-naminoḥ:""There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's name andKṛṣṇa."" So you encourage this movement. You will see that there will be no more fighting.Kṛṣṇahas come. WelcomeKṛṣṇa. But if you noncooperate withKṛṣṇa, then how you'll get happiness?Kṛṣṇahas already come by thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. You receive Him.Yadyadācaratiśreṣṭha[Bg.3.21].You are all respectable gentlemen. You accept it. Then others will follow.Tattadevetarojanaḥ.And if leading personalities of the society, they reject it, then howKṛṣṇais welcome? How can you expect? (Hindi) Everyone should welcome this movement,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. Then actually there will bedharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya,paritrāṇāyasādhūnām.Everything will be done. Just like whenKṛṣṇawas personally present, how many received Him? Only the Pāṇḍavas and thegopīsand theVṛndāvana-līlāis there. Nobody knew Him asKṛṣṇa. In the Battlefield ofKurukṣetra, how many knew Him that He wasKṛṣṇa? But everyone benefited. Everyone benefited. Everyone who died in the battlefield ofKurukṣetra, they got salvation. That is stated in Bhīṣma's teachings. So they got the benefit, but not that everyone understoodKṛṣṇa.Avajānantimāṁmūḍhāmānuṣīṁtanum...[Bg.9.11]. Many... Even nowadays there are so many scholars... They want swamis. They do not acceptKṛṣṇaas the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even nowadays, what to speak of then? Even at the present moment. They are readingBhagavad-gītā,and they are trying to killBhagavān,Kṛṣṇa. That's all. That is their business, killing... Kaṁsa's business.Kaṁsawas trying killingKṛṣṇa, always thinking, ""how to killKṛṣṇa?"" So so manyBhagavad-gītācommentators, scholars, their only business is how to drive awayKṛṣṇafromBhagavad-gītā.That is their... They do not give on the personality ofKṛṣṇaas the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I have several times told you. Even scholars like Dr.Rādhā-Krishnan, he says like that, ""It is not toKṛṣṇa, person."" Why? Why this demonic attitude? How you can get help fromKṛṣṇa? That is... We are discussing now,daivī-sampātandāsuri-sampāt. Āsuri-sampātmeans to killKṛṣṇa. That's all, to wipe outKṛṣṇafromBhagavad-gītāand bring something else. Six hundred and sixty-four editions ofBhagavad-gītā.This is going on.Prasāda.(end)"
