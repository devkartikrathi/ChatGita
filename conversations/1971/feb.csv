Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:When Himāvatī broke her leg they wanted to operate. I said, ""Oh, no, no chance. No operation."" Then they immediately said, ""Then maybe she'll never walk again.""",Prabhupāda,Just see.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:So I said, ""Well, how can we tell?"" They said, ""Well, there's no way to tell."" I said, ""Suppose we operate. Then it's guaranteed that everything will be all right?"" They said, ""No."" But they thought they should do that.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. They canvass, they convince like that and make experiment. That is their business. They have no, I mean to say, assured idea. Simply experiment. All these hospitals, they are meant for making experiment. I think I have told you one story of my servant. Did I?Huh?"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):That's a symptom of the modern civilization, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,Operation. That is... Demons are to be cheated like that. Simply operation. Simply operation.Bas.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Also they're trying to get money.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Injection and operation. That is in their hands.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Should we try to avoid getting injections as much as possible?,Prabhupāda,"That is my opinion. But as soon as you go to a medical man, especially in your country, first of all, you have to give blood, immediately. (laughter) One ounce of blood immediately. First business. And then other injection. Because I underwent so many medical examination, I have got experience. For my immigration. I think, three or four times I was under health examination, and blood-taking, and injection. Of course, it is not very painful. That arrangement is there. But the business is like that, ""First of all give your blood; then talk of other things."" Better to die without a doctor. (laughter) That's the best principle. Don't call any doctor. Simply chantHareKṛṣṇaand die peacefully."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:But what about when you're not going to die... What about when you have some problems that's not fatal. Then who would we call?,Prabhupāda,Then go take injection. What can be done? (laughter) There is no alternative.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):How long will you be feeling bad from the injection?,Prabhupāda,If it remains simply for a while that is sufficient to kill you. There is no question of how long.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):It's just that you don't look very... You don't look like your normal self. There's no...,Prabhupāda,"Sometimes they do business, simply water they inject. Yes. Simply water and take fee. They know there is no necessity of medicine; still, they will inject some water, distilled water, and take the fees. I have seen the doctors and some, I mean to say, ordinary man, illiterate. ""What kind of treatment you want? Injection or medicine?"" So naturally, he will say, ""The best one. I want to..."" ""Then you have to take injection."""
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Or both. You might get both.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. I have seen, they have spoken like that. Because the patient will think, ""Oh, I take injection, I'll be very quickly cured."" He will canvass like that. Because if he gives a bottle of medicine, that will not be very costly. But injection in his hand, he'll (have) at least five rupees, that much. So he'll canvass like that, ""What kind of treatment you want, injection or ordinary medicine."" So he'll say, ""Sir, best medicine I want."" ""Then you take injection."" That's all. It is a fact that the whole human civilization is a society of cheaters and cheated. That's all. Any field.mayaiva vyavaharite.The whole world in thisKali-yuga:mayaiva vyavaharite. Vyavaharitemeans ordinary dealings, there will be cheating. Ordinarily, there will be cheating. Daily affairs. Not to speak of very great things. Ordinary dealings, there will be cheating. That is stated in theBhāgavata, mayaiva vyavahari.The sooner you get out of this scene is better. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So long you live, you simply chantHareKṛṣṇaand preach Kṛṣṇa's glories, and that's all. Otherwise, you should know that this is a dangerous place.Padaṁpadaṁyadvipadāṁ[SB10.14.58].In every step there is danger."
Devotee:,"Devotee:...then why is any one activity ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness better than another one? Why is any one way of servingKṛṣṇabetter than another? For example, with chanting of the sixteen rounds. Suppose that you've gone 23 hours of the day servingKṛṣṇain one way or another, and the last hour there is opportunity to finish your rounds and also opportunity to make a life member. So instead of chanting your sixteen rounds...",Prabhupāda,But you cannot create your concoction! You have to abide by the orders ofKṛṣṇa.
Devotee:,Devotee:Then why...,Prabhupāda,"There is no question of why. It is the order of Kṛṣṇa's representative. You have to abide by that. You cannot say, ""Why?"" Then you are not fully surrendered, as soon as you say, ""Why?"" Surrender means there is no ""Why?"" It is ordered; it has to be done. That's all. As soon as there is ""Why?"", there is no surrender. The basic principle is misguided. We have to follow. Just like we have gottilaka.If you say, ""Why thistilaka?""There is no question of ""Why?""Mahājanoyenagataḥsapanthā.We have been instructed by theācāryas;we have to follow that. That is surrender. You cannot say, ""Why?"" Is that clear? As soon as there is ""Why?"", there is no surrender."
Guest:,"Guest:But suppose one is engaged for his livelihood for eight hours, or ten hours for material purposes...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,Guest:How he will link withKṛṣṇaduring that period?,Prabhupāda,"Well, you have got twenty-four hours. For livelihood... Your livelihood, if also... That also should be forKṛṣṇa. Just likeKṛṣṇasaid,yatkaroṣi.Yatkaroṣi.That means whatever you do, your livelihood is also... Do it. You do it forKṛṣṇa. Livelihood, just like we are also living, we are also eating, you are also eating. So what is the difference? You mold your life in such a way that that working for your livelihood would be also Kṛṣṇa's service."
Guest:,Guest:That should not be for ours.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Kṛṣṇasays,kuruṣvamad-arpaṇam,yatkaroṣi.""Whatever you do, the result should be given to Me."" Do for it. ""Do for for Me.""Yatkaroṣiyajjuhoṣiyadaśnāsiyattapasyasidadāsiyat[Bg.9.27].So this requires training, how everything can be molded forKṛṣṇa. Therefore guidance required, bona fide spiritual master required. Under his guidance, one has to do.Ādau gurvāśrayam.In order to executeKṛṣṇaconsciousness, one has to first of all accept a bona fide spiritual master. Then everything will be done. He is representative ofKṛṣṇa, and to act under his direction means acting underKṛṣṇa. He knows how to utilize your energy for service ofKṛṣṇa.Ādau gurvāśrayamsad-dharma-pṛcchatsādhu-mārgānugāmanam.Just likeRūpaGosvāmī, he was prime minister. He had no information ofKṛṣṇa, but since he saw... Of course,RūpaGosvāmī is eternally Kṛṣṇa's companion, but superficially he was showing that he was a prime minister and he was engaged in Nawab's service. But when he metCaitanyaMahāprabhu, then he decided that ""I shall retire from this service and actCaitanyaMahāprabhu's mission."" So what did he do? Whatever money he collected by his service—it was huge amount-fifty percent he immediately spent forKṛṣṇa. And fifty..., twenty-five percent he gave to the relatives, and twenty-five percent he kept for his emergency expenditure. So this division, fifty percent forKṛṣṇameans the whole life he acted as a minister, that means he acted forKṛṣṇa. Because the result is given toKṛṣṇaandKṛṣṇasays,yatkaroṣikuruṣvatadmad-arpaṇam.Is it clear? But our business is... Suppose I am earning for my livelihood. Everyone is working for... Livelihood requires only six annas per day. But he is earning six thousand per day, and he says, ""It is my livelihood."" Is it not fact? Very, very... Many, many big businessmen, they are earning six thousand per month...per day. But actually, for his livelihood he requires six annas. Why he's earning six thousand? ThenKṛṣṇasays, ""Give it to Me.""Yatkaroṣikuruṣvatadmad-arpaṇam."
Guest:,"Guest:InAdhyāyaTwoofŚrīmad Bhagavad-gītāKṛṣṇa, in one place He has told thatkarmaṇy evādhikārastemāphaleṣukadācana.",Prabhupāda,Huh?Maphaleṣukadācana.But don't take the result.
Guest:,"Guest:He has ordered for duty, ""You must do whatever you are doing.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So that duty should be performed. Nobody... Just likeArjuna.Arjunadid his duty. He was a fighter. But he fought forKṛṣṇa. That is his excellence. Is it not? He was a fighter. His duty as akṣatriya,his duty is to fight. But he fought forKṛṣṇa. Similarly, everyone can perform his duty. That is also enjoined in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Ataḥpumbhirdvija-śreṣṭhāvarṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ.Varṇaandāśrama.There are different kinds of duties.Ataḥpumbhirdvija-śreṣṭhavarṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ,svanuṣṭhitasyadharmasya.Everyone has got his particular type of duty, but how he is becoming perfect by performing his duty, that is to be seen whetherKṛṣṇais satisfied.Svanuṣṭhitasyadharmasyasaṁsiddhirhari-toṣaṇam[SB1.2.13]."
Guest:,Guest:How it can be judged that...?,Prabhupāda,"That by, through Kṛṣṇa's representative. He should certify, ""Yes. Your duty is nicely peformed."""
Guest:,Guest:How he may perfectly judge it? How the person will judge himself that I am doing...?,Prabhupāda,"No. He'll not judge. His spiritual master will judge. Kṛṣṇa's representative. He'll not judge. He will make mistake. Therefore, if one has accepted a bona fide spiritual master, that means he is in direct touch withKṛṣṇa. Transparent media. He has to seeKṛṣṇathrough the transparent medium of spiritual master. Therefore it is imperative, one has to accept a...Tasmādguruṁprapadyetajijñāsuḥśreyaḥuttamam[SB11.3.21].And what kind ofguru?Śabdeparecaniṣṇataṁbrahmaṇy upāśamāśrayam.So this is a big science. One has to study. One has to understand. The things are there. There is no difficulty."
Guest:,"Guest:Just you have told about liberation, and inAdhyāyaTwoKṛṣṇahas told thatjīrṇānivaśtrānivihāya...",Prabhupāda,"Aparāṇi.Navāṇīvaśtrāniaparāṇi, gṛhṇātyaparāṇi."
Guest:,"Guest:Yes. According to that version, one, if the soul was there, soul was there before birth, and after death, soul is there, and again the soul is coming in a new shape. So the soul is going on always, changing one body to another body, then how the soul is liberated? How it will be...",Prabhupāda,"Liberated means at the present moment under this material, in this material world, he is accepting material body, and when he is bona fide servant ofKṛṣṇa, he'll be offered a spiritual body. Just like a soldier. A person, so long he's not a soldier, he does not, he is not awarded the uniform. But as soon as he accepts the service as a soldier, immediately he is given the uniform. So you are accepting different bodies in the material world, and that isbhūtvābhūtvāpralīyate[Bg.8.19].You are accepting one type of body, it is becoming vāṇīshed, again you have to accept another. But as soon as you become perfectlyKṛṣṇaconscious,tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaiti[Bg.4.9],then, after leaving this body, he does not come to this material world. He is immediately...Mameti,he transfers. Similarly, he accepts spiritual body. Is it clear or not? You are accepting material body now, birth after birth. Is it not? That is transmigration. Sometimes you are accepting human body, sometimes you are accepting dog's body, sometimes you are accepting king's body, sometimes you are accepting somebody else. Is it not? Is it clear?"
Guest:,Guest:ButKṛṣṇahas toldArjunathat...,Prabhupāda,"First of all, try to clear this. Now, you are accepting different types of body. Is it not a fact?"
Guest:,Guest:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now when you areKṛṣṇaconscious, you haven't got to accept a material body. You go directly toKṛṣṇaand accept spiritual body. Then your life is eternal."
Guest:,Guest:Then again he will not get material...?,Prabhupāda,"No.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaiti[Bg.4.9].When you areKṛṣṇaconscious, there is no more accepting material body.Māmeti.Andmāmetimeans whoever goes toKṛṣṇa, he has as good a body asKṛṣṇa. That is oneness."
Guest:,"Guest:Then what does it mean whenKṛṣṇahas toldArjuna, in the battlefield that ""Do you think either you or I were not there in the past? And you and I will not be...?""",Prabhupāda,"SoKṛṣṇaandArjunaexisted. You are existing. You are eternal. You are simply changing body. SoKṛṣṇais existing; you are also existing. What is the difficulty to understand this fact?Kṛṣṇais existing and you are also existing. You are simply changing body, butKṛṣṇais not changing body. That is the difference."
Guest:,"Guest:Soul will not merge into that light, Kṛṣṇa's light?",Prabhupāda,"What is that merging? You have got that brain, merging."
Guest:,Guest:I told that... You have told...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Soul is changing body. Why you are talking of merging? You are changing body, you are individual. I am changing body. I may change to a dog's body, you may change to a demigod's body. That is going on. According to one'skarma,he is changing body. Now, when you areKṛṣṇaconscious fully, this change of body will take place also, but that body will be spiritual. So long you get material body, you have to change, one after another, one after another, one after another. Just like if you have a cheap thing, it goes wrong, you have to purchase another new thing. But if you purchase a real, nice thing it will go, continue for good. Similarly, so long you are getting this cheap body, material body, you have to change. And as soon as you get the most valuable body, spiritual body, there will be no more change. Why don't you understand like that? So that you have to get. That is very simple.Kṛṣṇasays,janmakarmamedivyamyojānātitattvataḥ.One who does not know what isKṛṣṇa, he thinks that somebody is greater thanKṛṣṇa. But anyone who knowsKṛṣṇaas he is, immediately he gets that permanent body. Simply by knowingKṛṣṇa.Janmakarmamedivyamyojānātitattvataḥ,tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimameti[Bg.4.9].Is it clear? Yes. So you have to do that. You have simply to understandKṛṣṇa. The whole problem is solved. (Prabhupāda is pounding on the table, stressing points.)"
Guest:,Guest:(Hindi),Prabhupāda,"(Hindi) You cannot concoct. (Hindi) Try to understandKṛṣṇa, andKṛṣṇacan be understood simply by devotional service.Kṛṣṇasays,bhaktyamāmabhijānāti[Bg.18.55].(Hindi) If you want to understandKṛṣṇa, you have to accept this devotional service. You cannot propose any other alternative. It is useless. Don't spoil time.Kṛṣṇasays,bhaktyamāmabhijānāti[Bg.18.55].And that begins: first of all, surrender toKṛṣṇa.Sarva-dharmānparityajya[Bg.18.66].Whatever nonsense you have known, thrown away. Simply surrender toKṛṣṇa. That is the beginning ofBhagavad-gītā."
Guest:,Guest:(Hindi),Prabhupāda,"(Hindi)Imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavān.Forty millions of years ago what He did, He remembers. Therefore Hismaraṇa.Hisjanmais different. (Hindi) He remembers. You do not remember. Yousambhava(?), but you do not remember. Why don't you understand the difference between your activities and Kṛṣṇa's activities? That is wanted. Why do you think that ""Kṛṣṇa is as good as I am""? Then you'll be able to understand Him.Avajānantimāṁmūḍhā.As soon as you think that ""Kṛṣṇa is as good as I am,"" then you aremūḍha.""Because He has appeared as a human being, therfore He is as good a human being like me."" That is the conclusion of themūḍha,rascals.Avajānantimāṁmūḍhamānuṣīṁtanumāśritam,paraṁbhāvamajānanto[Bg.9.11].He does not know what isKṛṣṇa. (Hindi)...bhaktyāmāmabhijānātiyāvānyaś cāsmitattvataḥ[Bg.18.55].[break] ...understandsKṛṣṇaas He is, then he's allowed to, ""Come on. Enter."" Not before that."
Guest:,"Guest:What about the argument, not (indistinct), but India we see that every great saint personality has surrendered toKṛṣṇa, evenMahatmaGandhi?",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no, no."
Guest:,Guest:He was also taking his...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. Don't say like that. Surrender ofKṛṣṇais different. Then you have to understand what is surrender.Mahatmanever surrendered toKṛṣṇa. He surrendered to yourself; therefore you killed him. (Indian laughs) He surrendered to his countrymen, and his countrymen killed him. He was working for his countrymen. That's all. He never worked forKṛṣṇa."
Guest:,Guest:But theGītāwas always with him.,Prabhupāda,"But, but, no but. You see from the action."
Devotee:,Devotee:What ischarka?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, spinning. Because he was spinning daily. Just like you are chanting sixteen rounds, he was spinning sixteen rounds. (laughter) And he said frankly, ""Are you spinningcharka?""They said, ""No sir."" ""Oh, then I am not going there. My god ischarka.""That is practical. We have got experience. And actually he was refusing. Just like we are insisting, ""You must chantHareKṛṣṇamantrasixteen rounds,"" he was... There were so manycharkasdaily selling. People took it very seriously. We also tookcharkaand that, what is called?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Handloom.,Prabhupāda,"Handloom. And there was very good business. So manycharkasand that handloom was sold in the shops because everyone was purchasing and purchasing. And they were stacked and thrown away some time after. So... BecauseMahatmaGandhiasked, everyone did. You see? So he also asked ourmaṭhapeople that ""Are you spinning acharka?""They said, ""No, sir."" ""Then I am not going."" He refused the invitation. Does it mean he surrendered toKṛṣṇa? He surrendered tocharka.That's all. (laughter) And if you say,""Charkais alsoKṛṣṇa,"" oh, there will be no more argument. (laughter)"
Guest:,Guest:(Hindi),Prabhupāda,Avatārameansavatāran.(Hindi) What is the meaning of descent? What is the meaning of descent? Coming down. Coming down. Yes.
Guest:,Guest:In the sense of quality or in the sense of form.,Prabhupāda,"The sense of form. Because your brain is congested with impersonalism, you cannot understand what is spiritual form. That is your defect."
Guest:,Guest:That is the trouble.,Prabhupāda,Yes. (Hindi) All hodgepodge things should be...
Guest:,Guest:(Hindi),Prabhupāda,"Yes. Therefore... (Hindi) What is this intellect? It is ignorance. This is not intellect. It is ignorance. You are accepting something wrong. That is ignorance. Ignorance isjñānavān.Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁprapadyate[Bg.7.19].That is knowledge. This is ignorance. He does not knowKṛṣṇa. And one who does not knowKṛṣṇa, he has no value of his knowledge.Bhāgavatasays,nateviduḥsvārtha-gatiṁhiviṣṇuṁ[SB7.5.31].Knowledge, what is the target of knowledge? To go up toViṣṇu, to understand.Tadviṣṇuṁparamaṁpadaṁsadāpaśyantisurayaḥ.Those who are actually intelligent, they are simply observing theViṣṇuform. This is Vedicmantra.So unless you reach to that point, your knowledge has no value. It is ignorance.Nāhaṁprakāśaḥsarvasyayogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ[Bg.7.25].So long you do not understandKṛṣṇa, that means your knowledge is covered still."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Śrīla Prabhupāda? Suppose for one who's not completely surrendered, how will he make choices? For example, suppose that there seem to be two different ways of servingKṛṣṇa...",Prabhupāda,He should consult his spiritual master.
Devotee:,"Devotee:Suppose for example questions are arising in my mind and I think to myself, ""Oh, this question is a foolish question, so I shouldn't waste the spiritual master's time."" But on the other hand...",Prabhupāda,No. Don't speculate. You should immediately refer the matter to your spiritual master.
Devotee:,Devotee:Then I would be asking you questions all day long and you'd have no time to do anything else. (laughter),Prabhupāda,No. You are welcome. You are welcome.
Devotee:,"Devotee:Then how do you... Suppose, for example, last night. I was chanting, and then I thought to myself, ""Oh, I'm not concentrating on the chanting any more. Now I should go to sleep."" Then how...",Prabhupāda,"Therefore you are, we have prescribed rules for chanting. You must finish sixteen rounds, then go to sleep, whole day sleeping. You finish that sixteen rounds and sleep whole day. I have no objection. (laughter)"
Devotee:,Devotee:But then...,Prabhupāda,"There is no then. Don't talk nonsense. If you are so much addicted to sleeping, you simply chant sixteen rounds and whole day sleep. But don't take food also. (laughter) Don't get up takingprasādam.""Now I have to honorprasādam.Let me eat sumptuous, then again sleep more."""
Devotee:,"Devotee:Is there some order of priority in service then? I mean, sixteen rounds is more important than anything else. And then following that, there's something else.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. If you cannot do anything else, you simply chant sixteen rounds, takeprasādam,and sleep. (laughter) It is special prerogative for you. There is no then. This is, this is order for you."
Devotee:,Devotee:In a situation where there's a choice between say chanting and reading. Is chanting a better activity than reading?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, chanting and reading is the same thing."
Devotee:,Devotee:But is one better than the other?,Prabhupāda,"No better. That I explained. It is absolute. Either you chant or read, the same thing. But you have to fulfill the sixteen rounds. That's it. All right. Let us... (end)"
