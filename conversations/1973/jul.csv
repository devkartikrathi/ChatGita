Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Śuṣka-vairāgya.,Prabhupāda,"Śuṣka,śuṣkameans dry. Oh, it is material, I shall not touch. I shall not touch. Just like that rascal, Ramakrishna, if anyone wanted to give him some money (gesture). (laughter) How, he does not touch money. These rascals, why shall I not touch? Come on, you have got money, George Harrison, spend. Yes, come on, I shall take it, forKṛṣṇa. We haven't come to this house for living very comfortably and enjoying. No, we have come here for Kṛṣṇa's service."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:This point is revolutionary in spiritual circles.,Prabhupāda,"Because it is Kṛṣṇa's property. It is not my property, neither George's property. This is mistake. Everything belongs toKṛṣṇa. So it must be utilized forKṛṣṇa."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Simply they don't knowBhagavad-gītā.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:They don't knowBhagavad-gītā, therefore they don't understand us.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Therefore I say, all... Immediately, how you are all rascals. We have got a test. Test tube. As soon as one is notKṛṣṇaconscious, he is rascal, he is miscreant, he is lowest of the mankind, he has no knowledge. These, these are groups, they belong to.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥprapadyantenarādhamāḥ.He maintains that he is very big man, Nixon, but we know that he is a rascal number one. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. You can understand immediately what is what. By this test:"
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:...you said if he's coming from God, then what difference does it make?",Prabhupāda,"You can see that you are a fool (but) God is not fool. That is the difference. But God is (indistinct), He'll not speak foolish. Because he is above all this foolishness but you are within the foolishness. That is the difference. Try to answer them like that. You are within the status of foolishness,māyā,and God is abovemāyā.If God is also within themāyā,as the rascal Māyāvādīs say, then what is the use of God? We are everything."
Yogeśvara,They just accumulate knowledge just for knowledge sake.,Prabhupāda,Not just for knowledge because they do not get any knowledge. They have no knowledge. What is the knowledge? They talk all nonsense. What is the knowledge?
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:His argument was ""Well there's no point in talking about this matter. All of us accept this."" He's saying: all big authorities, they accept this point of view, that this was recently written literature.",Prabhupāda,"No, they don't know who are authorities."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:That's right.,Prabhupāda,You manufacture your own authorities. You do not know. That is your misfortune. You do not know who is authority.
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:I met another old authority on Sanskrit and he is sitting behind his desk and his whole body is shaking: ""No, I'm not interested in the spiritual side of theseVedas.I'm just interested in the Sanskrit."" He's dying you know, and still he's like that. That's their authority. You can't save them but...",Prabhupāda,"Adhyaki, adhyaki(?),thereforeadhyaki(?)."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:What's that?,Prabhupāda,"External.Adhyaki(?).(indistinct) ...one is interested in the body not in the soul. So he is a fool. This, this sculptor, he is simply interested in the outward body, he has no knowledge of the soul. And he wants to become a very famous man, remaining in the category of asses. Because one who is in the bodily concept of life, he is an ass.Go-khara,kharameans ass.Saevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13]. Yasyātma-buddhiḥkuṇapetri-dhātuke[SB10.84.13].Anyone who is in the bodily concept of life he is no better than animal. The cats and dogs, they are also in the bodily concept of life.Saevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13].So he has not advanced beyond these cats and dogs because he is in the same conception, that I am this body. A dog cannot understand that you are not this body. So similarly, if the human being cannot understand that he is not this body, what is the difference between him and the dog? Sośāstrasayssaevago-kharaḥ:[SB10.84.13] he's no better than the cows and the asses. That's all. And actually it is a fact. The first instruction ofBhagavad-gītā, they cannot take it, and they're scholars. That is the most regrettable situation that these fools and rascals under the bodily concept of life, they are become authorities. Actually they are asses. Yes."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:I used to observe when I was going to the university that all my professors, their intellectual business was just a profession like digging ditches.",Prabhupāda,That's all. For earning money.
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:For their pleasure they're going home to drink beer and eat steak. That's all they're really interested in. They're just working to make money. I could see it and I didn't want to follow their footsteps.,Prabhupāda,"Just like aśūdra,he cleans in the road for money. They are going as professor but the category is the same. You don't make any distinction between that sweeper and this professor. Or a hog and cat and dog. The hog is also working hard, whole day and night for stool, eating. So this man is also working like that. Beyond that he has no other knowledge."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:The scientists, they have a term. Psychologists, they call it theidiot savant.Theidiot savantmeans he's an idiot but he has one particular talent and because of that talent he can get along. Just like sometimes you find an idiot, he can look at a column of figures and he can compute the sum in his head very easily but he can't even understand how to tie his shoes. And I think these scholars are like that, they're actually idiots but they have one talent for Sanskrit or for history and because of that they can get along. They can support their body but otherwise they have no qualifications.",Prabhupāda,"Śūdra.Unless he gets that post, he'll starve. He has got some talent in some particular subject but he must get some service. By serving others, he'll be able to utilize his talent and get some money, then he'll eat. This isśūdra'sbusiness. Dog's business. Just like a dog unless he has got a nice master, his position is very precarious. A street dog. Nobody will care neither it is (indistinct)."
Yogeśvara,"You point out inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamthat they go to school and learn to become Ph.D., then they have to knock on the door for a job and no one will open the door.",Prabhupāda,"No vacancy, sir. So just like dog."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:But they have a way to force them to work. The politicians force the scholars.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:If they don't print books, if they don't write a book every now and then and print it, get it published, they lose their tenure, their position as a professor. They must produce one book, then another book, then another book. If they don't, finished. In this way they are working all the time.",Prabhupāda,"The Marwaris in India, they don't educate their son. Just like Birla. They say, ""We can purchase these rascals, why we should waste our time. (laughter) So-called technicians, so-called expert computer, these are... We can purchase, why we shall waste our time."""
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:It's the same thing I learned in Germany. First I wanted to get my own press and I studied the situation very carefully and I saw it was ridiculous for us to do that, it's so much hard work. It's much easier to collect the money in the street by giving the magazine and then paying someone. They work very hard and do it. Everything is like that. They have so many people that can do everything. The one thing that people can't do is distributeKṛṣṇaconsciousness and for that Kṛṣṇa's giving so much money.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, thereforetasyaivahetoḥprayatetakovidaḥ.That verse. Only for this purpose one should endeavor."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Yes.Kṛṣṇa(indistinct) paying for that.,Prabhupāda,You cannot purchaseKṛṣṇaconsciousness—you can have money—that you have to cultivate.
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:Yeah, when Mr. Birla is getting old then he has to come to us, if he has any sense.",Prabhupāda,"No they say, they simply give primary education (indistinct) they can read, that's all. And (indistinct). They don't send because everyone knows that sending boys to the school means spoil them. That's all. I have seen intelligent boys, they go to school and he is spoiled. Yes, spoiled. He learns how to smoke, how to have sex, how to talk nonsense, how to use knife, how to fight, these things. At least at the present moment. Yes. Simply slaughterhouse, this so-called school is called slaughterhouse. Yes, slaughterhouse."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:It was when I went to school—I was a nice little boy—in school I failed out, only (indistinct).",Prabhupāda,"Yes, you must take as intelligent. That so..., time was wasted. Our, thisgurukulashould be taken care of very nicely. So nice preachers may come out.Brāhmaṇa,nicebrāhmaṇa."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:I'm still thinking about the other morning, we were talking about how everything is actually spirit. Everything is composed of spiritual atoms actually, souls. We were talking about the...",Prabhupāda,"That is Vedic version,sarvaṁkhalvidaṁbrahma,everything isBrahman."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:When we speak about the transmigration of the soul, we speak about 8,400,000 species. Does that include the inanimate objects as well, within those 8,400,000?",Prabhupāda,"Sthāvara,sthāvara,they are calledsthāvara,immovable. He means hills, mountains, stones. They are calledsthāvara.Sthāvara,which cannot move."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:So actually we don't really...,Prabhupāda,Sthāvarālakṣa-viṁśati.Two million types ofsthāvara.
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:So we don't actually discriminate between the tree, and say, the atom, as a living entity.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:Haribol.Little by little it's becoming clear.,Prabhupāda,"Sthāvara,sthāvarameans one cannot move, standing.Sthāvara-jaṅgama.There are two kinds of living entities. One moving, one not moving."
Yogeśvara,But the atom is always in motion. The atoms and molecules are always constantly moving.,Prabhupāda,That movement is different. That is not independent movement.
Yogeśvara,Is that to say that a stone has a living entity in it?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:Actually what we discussed is that every, even the elements, the atoms, everything is made of nothing but spirit souls in fallen conditions. Because everything comes frombrahmajyoti,which is nothing but spirit souls, andbrahmajyoti...Therefore soul never changes. So this manifestation is frombrahmajyoti.Therefore, it is made of souls. It is nothing else but spirit souls. Yesterday, a few days ago we discussed that.",Prabhupāda,"It is simply covered by another energy which is called material energy. And that ismāyā.Māyāmeans that is not actual, not factual. The example is given, just like the sun is covered by the cloud. The cloud is nothing but another creation of sun. But when the cloud comes, sun is invisible. Similarly this condition, forgetfulness, is my creation and when I am covered by this forgetfulness I become stones and atoms, like that."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:InBhagavad-gītā,it says that the soul is immovable. In the Second Chapter there is a verse that says the soul is immovable.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:What does that mean exactly? Are we not moving? In that verse it says immovable and...,Prabhupāda,"Sthāṇu,means fixed up."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:You mean its nature is...?,Prabhupāda,Unchangeable.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Unchangeable. Not that we are not moving. We are moving.,Prabhupāda,"Might be that word was not properly used.Sthāṇu,the word issthāṇu.If you have got Sanskrit, you know what is the meaning ofsthāṇu.Andacalo 'yam, acalo 'yam,yes."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:The point of all those...,Prabhupāda,"That meansacalo 'yamalso, soacalo 'yam. Acalo 'yammeans that does not move.Sthāṇur acalo 'yam,in theBhagavad-gītāit is given. You can see. Now there is no time."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:It's time for class. (end),Prabhupāda,"...recently I've heard that the people in the airport protested against IndiraGandhi, that ""Give us rain."" Yes. That is Vedic civilization ideal. Why there is rain then no rain? The king should be responsible. Onebrāhmaṇalost his son. He immediately went to the king and asked him that ""The son has died before the death of the father; why this irregularity? You are responsible."" You see? The ideal is that the king is representative of God, because we are all sons of God. We have come here in this material world for our proper guidance. The king is responsible, the spiritual master is responsible, the father is responsible, the elderly persons are responsible. Because you told me that we have to work for other. That other isKṛṣṇa. If we utilize our intelligence for servingKṛṣṇaunder the guidance of the king or the spiritual master or the father, then the society is perfect. That is ideal civilization. What is your opinion about this? How do you think this ideal..."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:I think it's... I... I... I wonder when it will come. Will it come on this level or what...?,Prabhupāda,"Immediately, provided you take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Immediately. It is not a question of when. Just like here is light. It doesn't depend there is darkness. You can remain in the darkness and immediately come to the light, and from the light immediately go to the darkness. So, this darkness and light, they are existing, co-existing. It is my choice whether to remain in the darkness or in the light. It is my choice. As soon as you are in the darkness, there is no light. As soon as you are in light, there is no darkness. It is your choice. And thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness is light. And anything else, that ismāyā.So we can accept eithermāyāorKṛṣṇa. If you take tomāyā,then you've spoiled your energy and time. If you take toKṛṣṇa, you utilize your energy and time. Everything is there, ready. You haven't got to create. Everything is there. Just like night is there and day is there. You can keep yourself always in day. Do you know how to do it?"
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Keep going round, I suppose. (devotees laugh)",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Nowadays it is not difficult, because..."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Airplane.,Prabhupāda,"Just like I started from India at eleven o'clock, and I came here at half past eight, the sunlight was still there. So if you proceed still further, further towards Western side, the night will not be able to come. So you can travel always in daylight. (laughs) Don't allow. It is an example."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Why do we choose the dark?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Why do we all choose the dark? Why are we all in the dark, most of us?",Prabhupāda,Dark means withoutKṛṣṇaconsciousness—darkness.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:And most people.,Prabhupāda,Due to bad association.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:To...?,Prabhupāda,Bad association.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Ah.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore, our Society is association. If we keep good association, then we don't touch the darkness. What is that association? There is a song,sat-saṅgacarigoinuasatevilāsateka namelagilomakarmabandhaphāṅsa.(?)Sat-saṅga.Sat-saṅgameans association with the devotees. That is calledsat-saṅga.So the, one poet,Vaiṣṇavapoet, is regretting that ""I did not keep association with the devotees, and I wanted to enjoy life with the nondevotees. Therefore I'm being entangled in the fruitive activities.""Karmabandhaphāṅsa.Entanglement. Here in this material world we act, and the result is there. Again we enjoy the result and act, again another result. We act, another result, another result. Because as soon as you act, there will be some result, good or bad. So, good or bad, by good result we get good birth, good money, good bodily features, good education—these are the effects of good work. And the effects of bad work, low-grade family, abominable, ugly bodily features, no education, no money, poor—these are the two effects of material good and bad work. But those who are trying to be transcendental both to the good and bad work, devotees, they are perfect. Because in this material world either you do good work or bad work, you have to suffer the material condition. Just like you are, suppose you are Englishman, you are well situated. But you can not avoid the influence of the weather. (laughs)"
David Wynne:,David Wynne:No.,Prabhupāda,"That is our problem. Either you become rich man or poor man, but you have to undergo. (aside:) Make the light. There is switch. (pause) So our position is that we are in this material world. George has sung that ""I am in the material world."" Yes, very sensible song. (laughs) He's good boy, realizing, he also... So this material life is not good. Material life is not good in this sense, because you have to change your body. Sometimes good birth, sometimes not good birth. Sometimes Englishman, sometimes cats, dogs. Because after death you'll get a body that will be chosen not by you but by the material nature. You'll create your body by your present activities, and nature will simply award you that body. So, so long we have got this material body, the four kinds of miserable conditions, repetition of birth, death, old age and disease, you have to suffer. Therefore, this human life should be utilized in such a way that we do not become subject to these four tribulations, birth, death, old age and disease. That is perfection. But people are not given that chance, the modern education, modern civilization. They've no knowledge; they do not know that there is life after death, although it is a simple fact. Just like in our present existence we have got past, present and future. Just like you are young man, you have your past. You are a child, or a boy, now that is past. Present, you are young man, and in future you are expecting to become old man. So as you have got past, present and future, similarly, I'm old man, I've got my past life, why not future? What is the reason to deny it? Past, present, future, that is the time calculation. I had my past, I've now present, and why is my future? They do not care for the future. They're so blind. There must be future. So what I'm doing for the future? Just like in this life we collect some money, keep in the bank balance so that in future, old age, I may not be in difficulty. Similarly, what a human being should do for his future life? That he does not know, although past, present, future is there. So this is foolishness. He doesn't care for the future. So one who is foolish, without any knowledge of the future, whatever he's doing is defeated—in ignorance, because it is ignorance. Just like a boy does not take education, does not think of future. That is not very good. We must be prepared for the future, his next life. Yes, where is that civilization? Where is that education, that people are thinking for future life? Is there any educational system at the present moment? So everything is being defeated.Parābhavas tāvadabodha-jātoyāvannajijñāsataātma-tattvam.Abodha-jāta,these rascal fools, born foolish. He does not inquire about the self-realization, so whatever he is doing, it is all defeat, he is spoiling his time, because he does not know.Ātma-tattvam,the science of self-realization. So in ignorance, whatever you do there is defeat. And they're being defeated and they're thinking ""I'm victorious."" This is calledmāyā.This is calledmāyā.So thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is very scientific. We are trying to save the living entity from disastrous condition. This is the aim and mission ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. It is not a religious sentiment, no. It is a very scientific. And we have got so many books already printed, and many books coming. Each and every one. You have seen our books?"
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Bhagavad-gītāhe has seen.,Prabhupāda,"If you read carefully, each and all carries volumes of meaning.David Wynne:Yes. Yes."
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):He's got theBhagavad-gītāthat the Queen was reading.,Prabhupāda,Ah.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):She was looking at...,Prabhupāda,"Bhagavad-gītā,ourBhagavad-gītā?"
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):Yes. Queen Elizabeth was looking, and she gave...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, as far as possible you should help everyone how to be, how to become enlightened about his future. That is real humanitarian work—to save a human being from the future disastrous condition of life. Just like a father thinks of his son, that he may not be unhappy in his future life. So it is the duty of the king, it is the duty of the father, it is the duty of the spiritual master to see that his subordinate is not falling a victim of future disastrous life."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Yes, she said, ""How marvelous it would be to completely trustKṛṣṇa.""",Prabhupāda,That's very nice.
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:She said, ah, ""What a relief to be able to pass all responsibility toKṛṣṇa.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. But that one has to learn, how to surrender toKṛṣṇa. The sentiment is very nice. It is just fitting from the royal... Because she's after all favored, she has taken birth in the royal family, so she is not ordinary woman. And her intelligence must be extraordinary. So she has remarked like that, what is that exact word?"
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:I think the exact word... She said ""How marvelous to be able to give all responsibility toKṛṣṇa.""",Prabhupāda,Yes.Kṛṣṇais ready.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yes. And she said...,Prabhupāda,But the thing is from our sideKṛṣṇaexpects something.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:(laughs),Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇais not a dead stone. Reciprocal. If you fully surrender toKṛṣṇa, thenKṛṣṇatakes full responsibility. If you keep some reservation,Kṛṣṇaalso keep reservation."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"This is it. WhenKṛṣṇaunderstands that you have fully surrendered, He takes full responsibility. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā:"
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):Sometimes people ask, ""If I surrender to God, give everything to God, then how will the state go on, how will the work, the factories, how would all that go on?",Prabhupāda,"That,Kṛṣṇais taking responsibility.Kṛṣṇasays,ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi.He takes responsibility. Otherwise what is the use of surrender untoKṛṣṇa? He takes responsibility."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):(laughs) Just can't go wrong, then.",Prabhupāda,"No.Kṛṣṇasaysahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi.ActuallyKṛṣṇais doing everything. We are thinking, ""I'm doing it."" We are doing nothing. Just like he has become a famous sculptor. Why you could not? Why, what is the reason?Sarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭaḥ[Bg.15.15].""I am seated in everyone's heart."" When He works,Kṛṣṇasays, ""Do like this; it will be perfect like this."" SoKṛṣṇais guiding. And everyone is being guided byKṛṣṇa, even in this condition of life. And when he fully surrenders, how much guidance he will come his way? Even without surrender he's guided. Without His guidance he can not do it."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:That's true.,Prabhupāda,"You cannot do it. Cannot do anything.Sarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭomattaḥsmṛtirjñānamapohanaṁca[Bg.15.15].Kṛṣṇais guiding everyone, even an ant.Kṛṣṇais giving information, ""Mr. Ant, there is a grain of sugar, you can go there."" Immediately goes. Otherwise, how he gets the information? For him, one hundred miles away, a grain of sugar, and he goes there. He did not inform. Who informs him? Who informed him?"
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:You feel this very much when one's trying to make sculpture, because it is impossible for a man; one can't do it...",Prabhupāda,No.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:...one has to wait and be passive...,Prabhupāda,"IfKṛṣṇawithdraws the intelligence, you cannot work. SoKṛṣṇais guiding already, but He's guiding at the present moment according to your whims. ""You wanted to do this? All right.""Kṛṣṇais giving intelligence: ""Do it."" But when he'll agree to act according to the whims ofKṛṣṇa, that is perfection."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:How do you agree to this?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
David Wynne:,David Wynne:How does one agree to this?,Prabhupāda,There is process.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You have to learn it. In the conditioned state we act according to ""my whims."" In the liberated state we act according to Kṛṣṇa's whims. That's all. That is the difference. That is the difference. Just see,Bhagavad-gītā.Arjunawanted to act according to his whims, ""Oh, He is going now fight with my grandfather, with my teacher."" These are the problems.Kṛṣṇa... ""No, I cannot fight."" And then at last he agreed to act according to the whims ofKṛṣṇa: ""Yes,kariṣyevacanaṁtava. Naṣṭomohaḥsmṛtirlabdhā[Bg.18.73]."" Find out this verse.Naṣṭomohaḥ.Whatever we are speaking, there is reference in theBhagavad-gītā.We don't speak anything according to our whims. No. Śrutikīrti: There it is. ""I am prepared now to act according to Your whims."" That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. When he was trying to act according to his whim, the necessity of instruction ofBhagavad-gītāwas there. And when he heardBhagavad-gītā,he's changed. ""Now this is..., all doubts are gone. At last I will act according to your..."" This is... Very important verse. Changing. Changing the whole picture. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. SameArjuna, same fighting, same battlefield, everything same, but still everything changed. The consciousness is changed. Externally nothing changed; internally changed. This change is equal for perfection."
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):So one doesn't have to give up his...,Prabhupāda,"No.Arjunawas a soldier, he was a fighter. The battlefield was there, the war was there, everything was there. He did not... He took toKṛṣṇaconsciousness does not mean he gave up the field and went away. He remained there, but simply the consciousness was changed. He was not willing to fight on his own account. He changed his opinion, ""Yes, now I shall fight. By Your grace, my all doubts are now gone."" This is required, this is perfection. And there's the picture howKṛṣṇais guidingArjuna. When the ranks are formed."
Devotees and David Wynne:,Devotees and David Wynne:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"""Just here. Just here."""
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Because it went on so long, we didn't stop. [break]",Prabhupāda,"Utilize His mercy. Then your life is perfect. He is ready to help you, from within and from without.Kṛṣṇais so kind. The kindness, the mercifulness ofKṛṣṇa, nobody can repay. In every birth, He is with me, canvassing: ""Why you are acting whimsically? Just turn towards Me."" Therefore He's going along with the living entity in every kind of body, either as demigod's body or hog's body, still,Kṛṣṇais there.Sarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭhaḥ[Bg.15.15].(pause) Give him someprasāda."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:They said it would be coming any moment.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:They're bringing someprasāda.,Prabhupāda,"Is there any other paper? No, it is a very impressive picture."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:It's wonderful.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And they have given, ""A Rival for Nelson."" So this movement is a rival... Days were there in British Empire that Nelson was a hero. NowKṛṣṇais going to be hero in this country. (laughter) It is a good admission, ""A Rival for Nelson."" Actually, He should be."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:I never heard of him.,Prabhupāda,"Lord Nelson, he fought the Spanish battle, I think."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:I don't know.,Prabhupāda,"He died, but became victorious. Yes. I think during Queen, last Elizabeth's time, or something...?"
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Yes. The last words: ""England expects that every man this day will do his duty."" And all that. He was a hero because he died young, I think.",Prabhupāda,"Maybe. I do not know. But Nelson, Lord Nelson, was famous man, soldier."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:I have just come from Morocco. I've been with the King of Morocco, who is... It's very strange because he is an absolute ruler, and when an ordinary man is an absolute ruler, it's rather dangerous.",Prabhupāda,"No. If the man is really Kṛṣṇa's representative, then it is all right."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Yes, he prays five times a day. He's a Moslem.",Prabhupāda,"That king should be a representative of God. That is ideal king. But if he thinks that ""This kingdom is my property, and let me enjoy for my sense enjoyment,"" then it is all gone. If he thinks himself as representative of God... Just like we think. Therefore we are after our disciples: ""Do this, do that, do that, do that."" We want to see that my disciples also becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. Similarly, it is the king's duty to see that every citizen becomes God conscious. Then he is representative of God. That is the first duty. The division must be there, and the, it is the duty of the king to see that everyone is discharging according to his responsibility. That is king's duty. Abrāhmaṇais acting exactly likebrāhmaṇa.Thekṣatriyais acting exactly likekṣatriya.Avaiśyais... Like that. It is the duty of a king to see that nobody's unemployed, everyone is engaged in his own occupational duty. That is the... And they must feel security of life, property, anxiety. That is perfect king. Here, at the present moment, nobody is confident whether he'll live after an hour or... You see. Anyone can take your property and life, at any moment. There is no protection. There is no protection. And so far anxiety, there is no length and breadth. People are always full of anxieties. Unemployment. These things should not be there. No unemployment, no anxiety, no feelings of insecurity. And that is good government. Nowadays there are police force. But what is the use of this police force? You go on the street, somebody stabs you, what police can do? If somebody takes away your money from your personal pocket, what the police can do? They'll take some note."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:That's right. If ...one boy who stole from us, I told the police. We told them exactly where he was, at the airport, Manchester. ""He's going on flight such and such to America tomorrow."" Plenty of time to apprehend him. They didn't do anything.",Prabhupāda,Just see.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:They came... Oh, they sent one inspector to take notes.",Prabhupāda,That's all.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Many notes.,Prabhupāda,"Useless, all... And taxation. No security and ninety-nine per cent taxation. Just see the fun. They are very much accurate to take taxation. And there is no guarantee of security. This is the position."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Has it ever been perfect?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Has it ever been on earth in the material world perfect with...?,Prabhupāda,Oh yes.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:It has.,Prabhupāda,"Five thousand years ago, it was all perfect. The whole world, this planet, was being ruled by one king. And they were all happy. That is in the history. Five thousand years ago. Maybe less, in three thousand years ago the history was different. The difficulty is that as soon as one is lost of his culture, he becomes an animal.Dharmeṇahīnāḥpaśubhiḥsamānāḥ.That is the difference between human being and animal. Human being must be with culture. Animal cannot be cultured. So a human being without culture, he's no better than animal. That culture is lost. They have missed the aim of life."
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:They think they have culture.,Prabhupāda,"What is this culture? A human being is killing so many animals, innocent animals, is that culture? They are less than animals. Who kills? The tiger kills, ferocious. A human being killing innocent animals... In Christian religion, therefore: ""Thou shall not kill."" But they are killing only. Where is the culture? Killing culture. That is not culture. What do you think?"
David Wynne:,David Wynne:It must be so. Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. How a human being can kill another human being or another animal unnecessarily? And if you kill, there is law, life for life. But they have made laws for human beings. When an animal is killed, he's not criminal. But in the God laws you cannot avoid that. If you have killed an ant, you must be shot. That is God's law. You can avoid man-made law, but you cannot avoid God-made law. That you cannot do. You must be responsible. If you kill an ant even without knowledge, you are responsible. Such subtle laws are there. So we must know our responsibility. Without knowledge, if we kill, we are responsible. And with knowledge, there is no question. Where is that culture? They advertise, ""Live and let live."" What is that? Do they do that? Actually? They want to live at the expense of others. Why not let live others? Where is that culture?"
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Now there is a famous cinema being shown called ""Live and Let Die.""",Prabhupāda,That is good culture. Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Favorite. Everyone likes it.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Let others die; you live.
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:And yet,Arjunahad to fight in the war, didn't he?",Prabhupāda,Hm?
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:In theBhagavad-gītā,he still had to... But it didn't matter him killing if it was Kṛṣṇa's responsibility?",Prabhupāda,"No. Fighting or killing, when it is done for, under the guidance ofKṛṣṇa, that is a different thing."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Yeah, I see.",Prabhupāda,"Just like a soldier fights on behalf of the king, and the more he kills, he gets medal. The same soldier, as soon as kills one man, he's hanged. He cannot say, the soldier, that ""In the battlefield I killed hundreds and hundreds men and I was rewarded. Now I have killed only one man, I am being hanged? What is this?"" Why? He's hanged. Because he killed on his own account."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:There's the thing.,Prabhupāda,And in the battlefield he killed on the state's account. He was rewarded. So there is difference between killing.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"When there is real, righteous fight, for good cause, that fighting is all right. Just like the state gives punishment one person, ""This man should be hanged. Kill him."" So who is blaming the state, ""Oh, the state is killing this man?"" That is right. It is good for him. InManu-saṁhitāthere is good background. So similarly, everything is good when it is done for the good. And God is good. That isKṛṣṇaconscious move... And everything is bad when it is done formāyā.That's all. So these wars are declared not for Kṛṣṇa's sake; by the politicians' whims. So they must be responsible for this war."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Like the Vietnam, you mean?",Prabhupāda,"Any, any war. They create whimsical... Anything you do whimsically, you are responsible. Anything you do. Why fighting? Anything."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yeah. It's funny that that John F. Kennedy, he started that Vietnam war, and he was shot down later.",Prabhupāda,He started that war?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,What is the position now? Nixon? He's going to be impeached? Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Practically, he is, without...",Prabhupāda,He's cornered now.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yeah. He's lost all respect.,Prabhupāda,"Prestige. Still if he sticks to his position, that is his foolishness. He should have resigned. If, if... Upright man: ""All right, you do not like me. I resign."" Then whole thing would have been quashed off. But he's a foolish man. He's sticking to his position."
Bhagavān,"Prasādamwill be here in a few minutes. Our position, I guess, is just to make it an easy choice for people.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,To come toKṛṣṇaconsciousness.,Prabhupāda,"But choice means, a child cannot be given for choice. He must be forced. Right child is a rascal. So you cannot give him choice. He must do it. That's all."
Revatīnandana:,"Revatīnandana:Or like, like our festivals.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Revatīnandana:,Revatīnandana:To make it easier.,Prabhupāda,"It is very nice. It is, what is called, nonviolent. We ask everyone, ""Come and join."" You saw our procession yesterday?"
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:No, I didn't. I wasn't there.",Prabhupāda,"I see. Many thousand people joined us. From two o'clock up to eight o'clock. Six hours. At last, the police had to ask them to go away. Is it not? Who told me that? Eh?"
Mukunda,I didn't know. I know they were...,Prabhupāda,"They were not leaving Trafalgar Square. So it is a very nice movement, very serious movement. You are known to so many big, big men. Try to induce them to understand this serious movement. If leading takes something seriously, others follow."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. At the present moment, the world situation is not very good. And it will deteriorate more and more if they do not take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness or God consciousness. When I speak ""Kṛṣṇa,"" that means God."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,What is your idea of God?
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Everything.,Prabhupāda,Hm?
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:It seems... I, I mean I, I don't know. I've thought of it, of course, many times as every intelligent person has, but it's, my idea of God is on the consciousness of the whole world, of all that we could possibly envisage, its consciousness is, that's God, and we're the little bits of it. But would you tell me...?",Prabhupāda,"Complete in everything. That is the conception of God. Complete in power, complete in knowledge, complete in beauty, complete in opulence... Everything complete. That is the conception of God. Everything complete. There is no scarcity. Everything complete, unlimited. So what is your idea of this material creation? Material means so much land, so much water, so much air, so much fire. So who created these things?"
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Well, God created it, and it seems to be the aspect of God that we are attached to.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:(laughs) But I'd rather you told me, sir.",Prabhupāda,What is that?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:This material world is like an aspect of God that we are attached to, but the God behind we don't know.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is our foolishness, that we do not know that behind this material cosmic manifestation, there is God. That information we get fromBhagavad-gītā. Mayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsūyatesa-carācaram[Bg.9.10].That means this cosmic manifestation is creation of God. The vast water is created by God. The vast land is created by God. Everything is created by God. Do you believe that?"
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"That's nice. So if everything is created by God, then, when you create something, is it your property or God's property?"
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Oh, God's.",Prabhupāda,That's it.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yes. But it feels like it when one creates it. One's surprised and didn't know what it was going to be like and cannot claim it.,Prabhupāda,No. God supplies the ingredients. That just like you are working on stone. So who has supplied the stone?
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Yes, this I can understand because it's...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Then you are working on the stone with your intelligence, but who has supplied you the intelligence? You are working with your hand, but who has supplied you the hand? In this way, if we consider that everything belongs to God; therefore the result must be given to God. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Sometimes one gets in the way. Sometimes one, when one's own wishes intrude, one can spoil what's being made by trying to put one's own ideas at the wrong time. But at other times, even with somebody who's as bad at it as me, the, something else does come through, doesn't it? The, the, what should be there if one senses and stands back and lets it come.",Prabhupāda,What is that? Sometimes it is not successful?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:When we try artificially to impose our idea on something, say, a sculpture, sometimes we make a mistake and it comes out not good.",Prabhupāda,That mistake you are responsible.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yeah. Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"Because at the present moment, as I told you, we are acting according to our whims. So if there is mistake, I am responsible."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:In, in,... Sometimes they call inspiration... They say, ""Oh, I've been inspired,"" and they create something beautiful by, automatically almost. What is that inspiration?",Prabhupāda,"That inspiration means you created an idea, that ""I want to do like that,"" and because you are persistent to act, so God helps you, ""All right, you act."" That is inspiration. But you are responsible. God gives you... You are persistent, that ""I must have it."" ""All right, do it."" That is inspiration. We should not do that. Unless it is desired by God, we should not act anything. That isbhakti. Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁjñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam,ānukūlyenakṛṣṇānuśīlanam... Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam[Brs.1.1.11].You should not have any (indistinct) for your satisfaction. Then it is all God's responsibility.Jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam[Cc.Madhya19.167]."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:What if there's some desire to make something beautiful to give toKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:If one wants to be ...,Prabhupāda,"Well,Kṛṣṇawill accept not from any ordinary man, unless you are devotee. If you think that ""I shall do something forKṛṣṇawithout having any relationship withKṛṣṇa,"" howKṛṣṇawill accept it?Kṛṣṇaaccepts only from the devotee. He does not accept anything from anyone else. He's not in want."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Yes, exactly. (laughs mildly)",Prabhupāda,"He's not in want. He's complete in Himself. But when a devotee gives Him love and faith, He accepts: ""All right. Thank you."" That is another thing. Otherwise, He doesn't require anything from him. What beautiful thing you can give toKṛṣṇa? He can create thousand times beautiful thing than you... What power you have got? Why should you desire like that? But if you are devotee, either it is beautiful or ugly, it doesn't matter. If you give toKṛṣṇain good faith, He'll accept it. It doesn't matter. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyaṁyo mebhaktyāprayacchati[Bg.9.26].He doesn't require anything. Butbhaktyā,in devotion and love, if anyone offers even a little leaf, a little flower,tadahamaśnāmi,""I accept."" He says. A little flower and little leaf, what benefit you'll do toKṛṣṇa, unlimited? But He says, ""Still, I accept because it is offered in faith and devotion."" So that is a different thing."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:It's funny, too. When David went to see the Queen one day, he took fifteen of our small rubies. They're not worth much compared to her crown jewels...",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. Certainly."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:But he told her that they were like... She said, ""Well, what shall I do with them?"" And he said, ""Well, they are... Consider them, Your Majesty, like flowers offered to you by one of your subjects."" And she became very pleased to see it like that.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. What, what is the value of those jewels to her? But if some citizen offers in good faith and love, she accepts. That's all."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Is it right thinking to think that one, although one can't give anything...Kṛṣṇa, of course, has everything. Should one not praise Him? Because...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. You should praise Him, certainly. That isbhakti.That isbhakti.Yes."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Because what I...,Prabhupāda,"Bhaktyāmāmabhijānātiyāvānyaś cāsmitattvataḥ[Bg.18.55].(People enter room, pause, moving tables, etc.) Takeprasādam.Prasādaṁprāpti-mātreṇabhoktavyam.(""Prasādamshould be eaten as soon as one obtains it."") Take."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:You must be hungry after all that hard work. (Eating, etc.)",Prabhupāda,This ishalavā?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yeah, it's bananas and cream. Everything.",Prabhupāda,Hmmm.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:The cream in England is excellent. (pause) [break],Prabhupāda,"So if the monarch becomes ideal, it will be very nice."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:There is still a feeling... In all other countries, everyone thinks, ""I can become the leader. I can become president."" ""I can become prime minister."" But in this country, everyone still must think, ""I cannot become the king. I cannot become the queen."" The king is something higher.",Prabhupāda,Oh yes.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:That's all right.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Because one sometimes feels that one isn't, doesn't know enough about it to do this, you know.",Prabhupāda,Or better than that is to praise the Creator.
Devotee:,Devotee:This sculpting is such a nice art. You're very fortunate to have such a skill.,Prabhupāda,"You can... (Prabhupāda is eating) Horrible. ...carve so many pastimes of God, Kṛṣṇa's. In India, the sculptor used to do like that."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:There's no great art that isn't religious in the world, that isn't to do about God. Because art about man is already debased, isn't it. Yes, must be. But I feel that if one even me, even people like me, the ordinary people making ordinary things, if they're, if it is praising nature... Because nature's an aspect of God, isn't it.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:And a pure one. Not, not spoiled. Anyway, that's what I tell myself. (laughs) What I mean is, if one makes a bird, if it has the feeling that becauseKṛṣṇabreathed life into it and made it, and if one can reproduce this and get the spirit of it, that's praising...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is also indirect praising. But you can praise Him directly."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:I think part of the trouble with our modern age is that no one has any information about God.,Prabhupāda,They do not know what is God.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:They can't praise Him directly because they don't know what He looks like or what He does. (Prabhupāda is still eating.),Prabhupāda,"What is this, behind thehalavā?"
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Behind it?,Prabhupāda,"Hm? Something is coming out, white?"
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:Oh, they probably put cream in it.",Prabhupāda,Oh.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Very good. Thank you. Lovely.,Prabhupāda,So how do you like our philosophy?
David Wynne:,David Wynne:How do I like...?,Prabhupāda,Our philosophy.
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:I, I like it, I admire it very much. I don't know...",Prabhupāda,Thank you.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:I don't know very much.,Prabhupāda,"I know, you, you, in one day or one minute, how can you know? But our basic principles of philosophy."
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yeah. I've been... I was more or less brought up... My mother told me when I was very small that theBhagavad-gītāwas the most important book in the world.,Prabhupāda,Oh!
David Wynne:,David Wynne:And theUpaniṣadsand theVedasand the...,Prabhupāda,"Oh, you are fortunate."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:So I've always known that it was true, but one, one's knowledge is very shallow. It's always felt true, is what I mean. Because anarti..., you know, a sculptor goes more by feeling than by thinking, you know.",Prabhupāda,"Sometimes in your, by your convenience you can come to our temple and see how they are executing devotional..."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Hm. Also one can tell a little bit about your teaching by the people one knows who were taught. I knowSamand I know George, and they've changed. George has grown much more, much more than the others. But I knew them when they were very young, you know.",Prabhupāda,Aiye.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:And George now has gained enormously in spiritual steps.,Prabhupāda,He's a very intelligent boy.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Oh yes. But he now is wise as well as just clever.,Prabhupāda,He's fortunate.
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:And so, from this I think...",Prabhupāda,No. Śyāmasundara has tried his utmost to convince him aboutKṛṣṇa.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:He said, ""Other religions... [break] ...come for a short time."" (Breaks in tape)",Prabhupāda,"Give him little, some morepurīs."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:...and something to wash hands in. (door closes),Prabhupāda,"No, he's bringing. You can take."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:David has said that he would like to spend some time, a day or something, making also your form into stone. Is that...? Or into some metal. Is that all right?",Prabhupāda,"Well, what I am? I am insignificant. I have no objection. Our, some of our artists may paint this picture. I liked it very much. (Probably speaking of picture ofRathacart in the Guardian newspaper)"
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Very clever person who has thought up this idea.,Prabhupāda,No other publication?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:I didn't see the newspapers today. I saw two or three, but on Sunday the reporters do not work. So if they were reporters coming, they came outside of their work hours. Some... I heard on television last night, though, there was a half hour program.",Prabhupāda,Oh.
Mukunda,Yeah. On the news they had a long sequence.,Prabhupāda,You have seen?
Mukunda,"No, Ranchor said it was very first-class.",Prabhupāda,Oh.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:They glorified the whole parade on television. They didn't make fun of it or like that.,Prabhupāda,Nobody should make fun.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:It wasn't just an objective report, but they said it was good, it was nice, and had good appeal.",Prabhupāda,"Yeah, everyone appreciated."
Mukunda,"The last thing they said on the program was, ""Perhaps this will give us something to think about for a long time.""",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes, certainly."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:No one could deny. They had never seen such a colorful parade, so full of festivity. (Someone walks up to Prabhupāda.)",Prabhupāda,"Oh, I could have gone there. All right. (Sound of washing hands in bowl.) Yes. So I am very glad that you have come and you have takenprasādam.Very nice."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Thank you, sir.",Prabhupāda,And we had very good talks also. I'm very glad.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:I'm hoping George will come tomorrow. He has indicated he would come Tuesday.,Prabhupāda,There is basin. You can wash your hands. Wash the dishes.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Even at night the sun is shining still. Or rather, the day is night.",Prabhupāda,Here. There is basin. You can wash.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:Yes.,Prabhupāda,I think I am eating more here. (laughter) Is it not?
Trivikrama,. Yes.,Prabhupāda,"I could not eat, in India."
Trivikrama,"Apparently, it's not causing any trouble either.",Prabhupāda,"At least, not yet."
Trivikrama,Not yet.,Prabhupāda,"That means I must have improved. Otherwise, how I am eating? I could not eat."
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:No hunger.,Prabhupāda,No hunger.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:India is so hot. It's so hot there you don't want to eat.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Dhanañjaya,It was a nice talk.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Dhanañjaya,Sublime.,Prabhupāda,The subject matter is sublime.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:This boy that you were talking to this afternoon is...,Prabhupāda,Now everything is finished. (laughter)
Devotee:,Devotee:He's going around to everyone.,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Devotee:,"Devotee:Would you like to wash your hands, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,I have got. Now you can distribute amongst yourselves. They have been...
Devotee:,"Devotee:This is a nice book,Upadeśāmṛta.",Prabhupāda,You have seen it.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:If one tries to praise the Creator by, directly, with his ability, what, how does he know what to...?",Prabhupāda,There are so many standard prayers.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:By his work, I mean.",Prabhupāda,Yes. To glorify God means the glorify the nature also. Just like here is a poem inBrahma-saṁ...
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:So we see in the creation of God, it also traces back to the Creator.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Creation means the Creator. Just like when I see the picture of so many sculptor. So who has done it? I come to David. To appreciate the creation means you have to come to the point, appreciating the Creator. Otherwise, it is not finished. Or your knowledge is imperfect still. So these scientists, they are simply trying to study the creation. They have no knowledge about the Creator. That is the defect. Neither do they try, neither they can understand. They are so foolish and poor fund of knowledge. They should try to understand the Creator also. Then the knowledge is perfect. Just like the scientists, they are theorizing that life began from matter, chemicals. But wherefrom the chemicals came? That is insufficient knowledge. They say, ""Chemicals existed."" Now, we have no such experience... Just like we ate somepurīs. Purīshad to be created. Not that existed. It is existing, but when I require, I have to create it. The crude example. The chemicals, wherefrom the chemicals came? That is answered in theBhagavad-gītā.In this way you have to study. Simply to study the creation, that is imperfect knowledge. When you come to the Creator, then it is perfect. Just like if you see simply his sculptures, so many things, that is not perfect knowledge. Why this book is ""David Wynne""? Now, you go to the creator. And ...the all appreciation is there, credit is given there. That is perfect. Otherwise, you see, so many stones are there, figures are there. But when you study that ""This is the creation of such and such artist, sculptor, and he's such and such,"" then that is perfect. Study him."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Just like by my knowing David, it's very easy to understand his sculpture.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:But someone who's just seeing his sculpture, they don't know what...",Prabhupāda,That is not perfect knowledge.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:They don't know what he's like.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That is not perfect knowledge. Perfect knowledge is when you understand the creator. What do you think?
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:I think yes. I'm not sure that the analogy..., I think that the greatest... Well, it is true because with the greatest sculpture, one does get to the full understanding, but if one really understands the universe, well, one would see God, I suppose.",Prabhupāda,No.
David Wynne:,David Wynne:No.,Prabhupāda,You have to penetrate. You have to understand who has created this universe.
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Yes. Yes. But if a great artist was no longer alive, people would still appreciate...",Prabhupāda,"No, but the God is not like that, no longer alive."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:No, but that's what I mean. The analogy falls down there, doesn't it.",Prabhupāda,God is not like that.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:But you're saying that it's better to first penetrate and understand God.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Then understand the universe.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That is perfect knowledge.
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:And science almost denies the existence of God in order to exist, doesn't it?",Prabhupāda,"That is a rascal. These rascals say like that. Anyone who denies the existence of God, he is rascal number one. Immediately. And anyone, he may be a great scientist or philosopher, let him come. If he says that ""I don't believe in God,"" then I shall prove that ""You are rascal number one."" That I shall prove."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:We'll bring you some scientists.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So many scientists, psychologists, philosophers came to me."
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:But the greatest scientists have..., are the humblest.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is real knowledge, when one becomes humbler: ""Oh, God is so great."" That is real scientist. I think Professor Einstein, he admitted."
Mukunda,"Yes, he said that ""I want to know how God created the universe. Everything else is details.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So that means he's still thinking, ""My knowledge is imperfect because I do not know about God."" That is real scientist."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Just studying one small part of God's creation...,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:...is, is...",Prabhupāda,"You see how nicely God has created this flower. How nice artist he is, how he has put the color exactly to the same point. So there is no hand? This is foolishness. It is going on. There is hand of God, but how His hand is working we do not know. That is explained in theVedas:parāsyaśaktir vividhaivaśrūyate[Cc.Madhya13.65,purport].He has got so subtle power that it is working, but we are seeing that it is automatically being done. But He's working. He's working. Just like we work. To paint one flower, we require a brush, color and so many things. Similarly He also requires. But His requirement are supplied so quickly that we see, ""It is being automatically done."" That is the... Because He's so perfect and unlimited that His working capacity we cannot follow. These are explained in theUpaniṣads,that God has no leg, but He can go so fast that nobody can compete with Him. These are the statements theUpaniṣads,that He goes so fast that nobody can compete with Him, nobody can go with Him. That is God's energy. So when it is said, ""God has no leg,"" that means He has no this imperfect leg. He has go..., He has got so perfect leg that nobody can walk with Him. This is the idea. Not that God has no leg. He has got leg, but not this rascal leg. After walking three miles, that's all, finished. (laughter) Not like that. Not like that.Paśyatyacakṣuḥ.He sees, but he has no eyes. These are the statements in theVedas.He has no eyes... Just like we have got eyes, but we cannot see beyond this wall. But He can see everyone's heart, what he is thinking, what he is doing, everything. You cannot hide anything from His seeing.Paśyati.That is, that is His seeing.Paśyatyacakṣuḥ.As soon as we hear something ""seeing,"" immediately understand the relative term that one must have eyes to see. Then when theVedassaysacakṣuḥ,immediately warns that ""Don't think God has got eyes like you."" Because as soon as we think of eyes, we think of our eyes. We cannot think that there can be eyes which can penetrate everywhere. We cannot think of that. And therefore they become impersonalists. Because we rascals, when we think of God's personality, we think of our personality. ""So we are imperfect. Therefore, how God can be person? He must be just opposite."" Imperfect knowledge. They cannot think, these impersonalists, that God is person but all His bodily construction is perfect,sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. Īśvaraḥparamaḥkṛṣṇaḥsac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ[Bs.5.1].That Him they cannot think. That means poor fund of knowledge. The impersonalist cannot think that having eyes, how one can see everything all at a time, past, present and future. But that is impossible by us because we have got imperfect eyes. Therefore they conclude, ""No eyes. He must be without eyes."" Imperfect knowledge."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:So if God is a person with eyes, legs, He stays in one place?",Prabhupāda,"Again, the same... You are comparing with yourself. Because your person can stay in one place only. That means you are simply comparing the Personality of Godhead with your personality. That you have to forget. He, He stays everywhere.Golokaevanivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ[Bs.5.37].Therefore we have to consult the authoritative Vedic literature. This answer is there, thatgolokaevanivasaty,""He is living inGolokaVṛndāvana; still, He is everywhere."" You cannot think of. You are in this apartment. You are not in your office. ButKṛṣṇa, although He's inGolokaVṛndāvana, He's everywhere, in everyone's heart. He's seeing everything. That you cannot imagine, how it is possible. That means you want to compare with your, this foolish, imperfect personality with God's personality. That is our defect. He's distinct from our personality, but He's a person. Yes.Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānāmekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13).He's also a person like us, He's also living entity like us. But what is the difference? He's the maintainer; we are maintained. How many persons you can maintain? A family of two children and one wife, you are embarrassed. And He's maintaining everyone.Ekobahūnāṁyovidadhāti...Innumerable living entities, He's supplying food everyone. He's supplying food the ants within the hole of your room there are thousands of ants. You are not supplying food. How they are getting food? Similarly, you go to the African jungle. There are thousands and millions of elephants. They eat one at a, oh, huge quantity. He's giving food.Ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān.In the air, within the water, there are so many living entities. In the air there are so many living entities. On the land there are so many living entities. Everywhere. How He's feeding? That is the distinction between God's personality and our personality. We are embarrassed to maintain a family of four, five members, and He is maintaining the whole family of living entities. Not only one planet, there are innumerable planets. And not only innumerable planets, the one universe, then innumerable universes. And these, all these taken together, this is one-fourth creation of God. So three-fourth creation is of the spiritual world. Just imagine how big it is. All of them being maintained by that one. This is the difference. (Someone comes in). Come on.Ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān.This is the distinction.HareKṛṣṇa."
Devotee:,Devotee:Haribol.,Prabhupāda,"So you can, at any time, visit our temple. You can understand, try to understand the conception of God. We shall try to explain. But we can, at least, so far our knowledge is concerned, we have got a clear conception of God, what is meant by God. Therefore we do not accept the so-called dogs as God. No. So many people come: ""I am God. I am God."" We kick on their face. We don't accept. We don't accept such cheap gods. God is one, and He's all-powerful. That is our conception. We all servants of God. If anyone says that ""I am servant of God,"" he's welcome. He's my master. The servant of God is my master. And if anyone claims to become God, I kick on his face. This is our principle. Because he's pretender, cheater. He should be punished immediately. So you, there are other papers also, published? You have seen? No."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:You saw inside the pictures?,Prabhupāda,Yes. But this picture is very nice.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yes. The other pictures were quite revealing too, because they showed Englishmen and Indian people, foreigners everyone.",Prabhupāda,"Everyone, yes. And they have declared that we have distributed ""freeprasādam."""
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:""To all and sundry.""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Oh. That's a good idea. We'll try to get the photograph of that, original photograph from the paper.",Prabhupāda,Hm. That will be very nice.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:We can use it in our magazine. Coverphoto.,Prabhupāda,Hm? Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Make it a coverphotofor a magazine.,Prabhupāda,"""Rival of Nelson."""
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yeah, ""A Rival of Nelson."" Just before, maybe two months ago, the boy who was in charge ofRatha-yātrā,Mahā-viṣṇu, we were, he was in so much torment because where was the money going to come from to create such an extravaganza. He wanted to have the best festival ever made. And suddenly he got a letter in the mail: ""Your aunt has died, has left you eight thousand pounds."" (Prabhupāda laughs)",Prabhupāda,Just see.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:So with that money, he has spent everything forKṛṣṇa, just to glorify Him in that way. He even printed the magazine, everything.",Prabhupāda,His aunt's money has been properly utilized.
Devotee:,Devotee:Do you translate now?,Prabhupāda,What is that?
Devotee:,Devotee:You will translate now?,Prabhupāda,Translation? Yes. Everything is ready. Who has taken thatCaitanya-caritāmṛta?
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Must have beenPradyumna.,Prabhupāda,He has not come back? Why he hasn't?
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yeah. Make out the form. I'll go right now.,Prabhupāda,First of all phone if they're open.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Twenty-four hours.,Prabhupāda,Oh. Then that's all right. Then do it. I think you have to pay some money.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:That's all right. We tried to sell your coin today, but it's only worth three or four pounds.",Prabhupāda,"Well, that's not bad. (laughter) One rupee."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Yeah. That's not bad for one rupee.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Just like...
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Prabhupāda has this mint 1935, 1835 rupee piece. Show it to him.",Prabhupāda,Indian rupee.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Indian rupee. And we thought it might be pretty valuable. So old, more than one hundred years. We went to three places, they all said three, four pounds.",Prabhupāda,"So highest bid, what was?"
David Wynne:,"David Wynne:Yes, I think, (indistinct)",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Mukunda,"He said if it was in perfect condition, mint condition, then he would give me two pounds. But in this condition, only one pound. He brought out many samples of old rupees with different people on them.",Prabhupāda,You said three pounds?
Mukunda,One man said three pounds.,Prabhupāda,So why don't you sell to them? (laughter)
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:If we tell them... If we go around the city, we could probably get four pounds for it somewhere.",Prabhupāda,So get the best price and sell it.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:All right.,Prabhupāda,I don't want any antique. (laughter)
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Oh, King William. The British...",Prabhupāda,I think Queen Victoria's father. King William. Is it not?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:East India Company, it says on here.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:So the coins were given out by the East India Company.,Prabhupāda,Yes. First of all the Britishers went there as East India Company to have trade connection.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Disguise. So we should sell it for any price?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Formerly, people could purchase any amount of coins from the currency."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:From who?,Prabhupāda,"From the currency, government currency."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Government.,Prabhupāda,"Any amount of coins. In our childhood... Why our childhood? Even when we were young men, the Indians, generally, they like Guinea gold, British Guinea, what is called, pound?"
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:One pound, one shilling.",Prabhupāda,"So in India it was available, any amount. You pay price and take. And they would melt it and make ornament, that Guinea gold. There was no restriction. You can purchase any amount."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Why all of a sudden it changed?,Prabhupāda,"But, they have lost all gold. There is no gold, simply paper. That's all. Simply blessing, ""Yes, you'll get money."" (laughter) But you'll never get. In the bank also, any amount of gold you can purchase. Bank was canvassing that ""You take gold from us."" I do not know where those gold gone. Nowhere, all over the world, you cannot purchase gold. Even in America."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:You can purchase some places, but the price is so high for a small amount.",Prabhupāda,"Zurich, you can get."
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Yes, Switzerland.",Prabhupāda,But you cannot get out with the gold.
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:No, officially not.",Prabhupāda,"Well? Then? Suppose you purchase gold there. If you want to take out, they will not allow."
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:Not if they find it.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Śyāmasundara:,"Śyāmasundara:Officially, no, they will not allow.",Prabhupāda,"And these currency notes, the price, commodity, has gone so high due to this rascal currency. Because your enemy country, they print counterfeit and they overflood in the market. So how you can check it? You cannot check. I know, during wartime, a Chinese man was coming in Calcutta, and he had a purchasing agent who was my friend. So he would come, and he would give a list of goods, especially rare medicines, and he'll deposit with him bunch of notes, ""You spend, purchase, and whatever..."" That means all those notes were counterfeit. (end) ...Greek dictionary, Kristo"
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:Kristo...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well yes,",Prabhupāda,Kristo
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:""The anointed.""",Prabhupāda,"""Anointed,"" yes."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:I understand.,Prabhupāda,"So in India, ordinary men, they callKṛṣṇa""Kristo."" My younger brother, his name wasKṛṣṇa. But we are calling him ""Kristo."" That is ordinary use. So this Kristo word came from India. What is your opinion?"
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:I'm sorry. Can you...? Are you asking me?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, Kristo. This is calledapabhraṁśa.Apameans perverted, perverted spelling ofKṛṣṇa."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I do not know the true answer to that question, I'm afraid.",Prabhupāda,"And the meaning, anointed. What is the explanation of anointed?"
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I am not sure whether this was a title applied to him by his disciples or whether it was a title which he himself explained to them, and it makes a difference whether he regarded himself as being anointed... If so he would have said this was by the..., his father.",Prabhupāda,But Kristo is person.
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:It is a name applied to...,Prabhupāda,"It is a name, then it must be a person."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, that is true. But the name is not always the same as the thing it describes or the person it describes. My name, I have said, is spelled in English in a certain way. It could be pronounced Waddle, Wawdle or, you know what I mean.",Prabhupāda,"No, I am just suggesting there is similarity and the meaning ""anointed."" And from Kristo, the word Christ has come."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, in English, that is quite true.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Now the Christ, what is the meaning of Christ?"
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I, well, it is this that he is the anointed.",Prabhupāda,"No, Christ means love, something like that."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:It is connected, I suppose, with the word meaning grace, which is... There is another Greek word which is ""havis.""(?) But I am not a theologian. You know, I am not a brilliant man who understands all the meanings of the words in the Christian faith. But I think the word Christ means anointed, and that it may well be connected with another word which means grace or favor. But I don't think it is the same word.",Prabhupāda,"My idea is that if we can connect this Kristo and Christ, that ""love of Godhead,"" there is some meaning. Because we, ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement means we are teaching people how to love God. That is our..."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:To love is very difficult, is it not? It is very difficult.",Prabhupāda,"No, it is not difficult."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, it is both difficult and not difficult.",Prabhupāda,"No. Everything, there is a Bengali word,yanrakaryataresaje,anyalokelatibaje.(?) Anything, if one is practiced to do, he can do it very easily. And for others, it is just like striking with a rod.Anyalokelatibaje.Suppose if there is some difficulty in electricity, I do not know anything. It will be very, very difficult task for me. But anyone who knows, immediately he connects two wires, there is light. It is simply to know the art."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, I would say with respect, it is easy to feel love for people. It is not always easy to put this love into practice. Sometimes to love, you may have to be hard, apparently hard, to a person if you wish to help them.",Prabhupāda,"The thing is that we want to love people, we want to help them, but if we do not know the process... The same thing, love orhate. That's it. You should know the process how to love. So our process is according to Vedic injunction, thatyathātarormūla-niṣecanenatṛpyantitat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ[SB4.31.14].Just like if you pour water on the root of the tree, automatically the branches, the trees, everything, watered.Prāṇopahārāccayatendriyāṇām.If you supply food to the stomach, the energy is distributed to the hands, legs, eyes, and everywhere. This is the process. But if you take the food and separately push on in the eyes and the ears and the hands and the fingers it is useless."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh yes, I agree, but...",Prabhupāda,"Similarly, if you try to pour water to each leaf of the tree, it will be simply waste of time. Similarly, God is the root of everything. OurVedānta-sūtrasays,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1],Absolute Truth, wherefrom everything has come. So if we love the root, God, then we can love others. Otherwise not possible. Otherwise it is simply waste of time. They have tried. The so-called humanitarian work they have tried. Unity and fraternity and so on, big, big words. But it has not come to... Because there is no love of Godhead, it has failed. Even the United Nations. Central point is missing. So our Vedic injunction is thatsavaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo yato bhaktiradhokṣaje:[SB1.2.6] ""That system of religion is perfect which teaches how to love God."" It doesn't matter, Christian religion,Hindureligion, Mohammedan religion, it doesn't matter. But God minus, this is the present position. Everyone wants to make minus God everything. This is going on. They have no clear idea. If I want to love you, I must have a clear idea of you. On vague idea, I cannot love. But they have no clear idea what is God. So how they can love God? And because they have failed to love God, all the so-called love, humanitarian, philanthropic works and, you know, they have become useless."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes. The problem is a very big one. We are, perhaps, sent into this earth to know or to learn how to love.",Prabhupāda,"No. I have got some objection. You cannot begin any scientific statement with the word ""perhaps."" (W. laughs) We don't accept. You must be assured, you must be assured."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I am merely saying... I do not wish to be presumptuous, if you understand me.",Prabhupāda,"Well as soon as you say, ""perhaps,"" ""maybe,"" that is not... This has no meaning. Because it is not certain. You have no clear idea."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But are there not things about which in the mortal life one can have no clear idea?,Prabhupāda,"But if there is clear idea, why they should not take it? Why they should speculate ""perhaps,"" ""maybe""?"
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But there are many things about which I cannot have any clear idea. I cannot...,Prabhupāda,"No, you cannot have but if you get clear idea, why you do not take it."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:No, I mean even in the physical realm. I cannot at this moment conceive what it is like, say, to be in Sydney, in many cities in the world. There are many things, many bits of knowledge which I cannot have. I cannot be everywhere at once. I am here now. I do not even know what is happening in the place from which I have come.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:And I must accept that. I cannot be certain about that. Would you not agree?,Prabhupāda,"But if there is a process... Suppose you are not in Sydney, but if there is a radio message from Sydney, how do you accept it?"
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, well, I'd believe it.",Prabhupāda,Then that is a question of belief.
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But that is not... Belief is not quite the same thing as...,Prabhupāda,"No that is not belief; that is fact. Suppose a radio message is coming from Sydney, we accept it-fact. Although I am not in Sydney. So it is a question of process, how to receive the message. If the process is perfect, then the message is perfect."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But one has to believe the...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, if the process is perfect, one has to believe, one has to believe. Just like I will give you one example: Nobody knows who is his father; neither it is possible to know one's father by speculation. But there is a process. If you ask your mother, and if she: ""This gentleman is your father,"" you accept the process and you get the perfect knowledge."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:One could look like one's brother. (laughs),Prabhupāda,What. I do not follow. What is...?
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I have a brother, who is very like me, and, well, this helps me to believe that I know who my father was.",Prabhupāda,No.
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:In one sense.,Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. Because one gentleman resembles your features, you think that he is your brother. That is another thing. But here the process that if you want to know who is your father, the process is it should be known through the mother. There is no other process. It is not that suggestion: because somebody resembles my face, he is my father. Not like that. It is the perfect process."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, yes, I agree with what you say. I am just adding another explanation.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. And you cannot understand your father by any other process. This is the only process. That means things which are unknown, beyond our conception, you have to know it through the authority. Just like you know your father through the authority of your mother."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, yes, I agree. But...",Prabhupāda,"But you cannot say that things which are beyond our imagination cannot be known. You cannot say that. Can be known, provided you have got the real process."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I'm afraid I must make, so far as I am concerned, a clear division between what I know and what I believe. There are certain things... It is maybe, partly a use of words, but whereas I know that I am here and that I have people in..., I am in the same room with other men...",Prabhupāda,"Do you think that this process, as I have suggested, to know one's father through the authority of the mother is not perfect?"
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, well, I think it's as near perfect as you can get.",Prabhupāda,"Why you say, ""as near""? Why still doubt?"
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Because it is not quite the same thing as my knowing that I am here. There's a famous French philosopher who began all his philosophy from the phrase ""I am conscious; therefore I know that I exist."" And he deduced everything, you know, starting from here.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That's a fact. You are conscious, I am conscious, that's a fact. It is not the question of belief. It is not question of belief. Belief may be wrong, but fact is fact."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, agreed.",Prabhupāda,"So when one's... I say that I am conscious, you say you are conscious. We are conscious. That's a fact. And that consciousness is the symptom of the presence of the soul. Because from the dead body... Dead body means when the soul departs from the body, there is no more consciousness."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:This is something on which I think I am probably too young or too..., I have not thought enough about it to be able to tell you very clearly or to define very clearly what I think. This is very difficult I know. But I am conscious that I do not know about this. I can make certain... I mean I am inclined to accept what you say, but I cannot say that I know it.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore when we are in doubts, therefore we have to refer to the authority. Just like when you are diseased, so you go to the physician, ""What is the cause of my this trouble?"" Similarly, when you are in doubts, you have to approach an authority to clear the doubts. Otherwise you will remain in doubts, ignorance."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore our Vedic injunction istad-vijñānārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet[MU1.2.12].Tad-vijñānārtham,in order to clear the doubt, to be in perfect knowledge, one must approach the authorizedbona fidespiritual master."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:Can we go back to the physician. It is possible for a physician to be wrong.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, we are always in wrong because we are born ignorant. Everything is wrong because ignorant, foolish. Madman's conception. This is all wrong, childish. Therefore we send our boys, children, to school, to correct the wrong ideas."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But some of the teachers may not be correct.,Prabhupāda,"No. The process is you have to go to the teacher. But if the teacher is a cheater, then the whole thing is spoiled. A teacher must be teacher, perfect teacher. But if he happens to be a cheater then the whole thing is spoiled."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But the human situation is often a sort of mixture of the two. Sometimes...,Prabhupāda,"No, mixture of two, that may be, but the process is that we have to approach the real teacher. Just like I approach the mother. Mother is supposed to be not cheater. But if the mother happens to be a cheater, then I am cheated. I am cheated. I don't get the information of my real father. But it is expected the mother should not cheat."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, oh I know that it is expected of the teachers.",Prabhupāda,"So it is my misfortune; if I get a cheater mother, then my whole life is spoiled."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But the teacher may be wrong without wishing to be wrong.,Prabhupāda,"No, he is not teacher. If a teacher is wrong, he is cheater. That is our proposition."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, I'm sorry, this is a point which we must surely...",Prabhupāda,"This is the real point. If you have to go to a teacher, you must go to a real teacher. You don't go to a cheater."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But suppose I teach you something, a subject in which knowledge is not complete.",Prabhupāda,Then you should not be teacher. Then you should not be teacher. Then you are cheater.
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But... No, because knowledge is...",Prabhupāda,"That is, that is, that is our... Teacher means... When I approach a teacher, he must be abona fideteacher. He should not be cheater. If he has no sufficient knowledge, he should notposehimself as a teacher."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, I am afraid I would be right out of court cause you see I have often to confess to my pupils that I do not know.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is going on, but that is not the system. If you do not know, you should not become a teacher. That is our proposition. (laughs)"
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I see, well I am not at all sure that I could accept what you say. (laughs)",Prabhupāda,"You must be sure that whatever knowledge you are giving, that is perfect. Then you are teacher."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, you see, what you are... In that case, I should have to pretend, you see. I would have to pretend to know something which I did not know at all. Then I should be a cheater, wouldn't I. And that would be wrong. And there must be many things which I do not know.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. It is better to become honest. If I do not know anything perfectly I should not be teacher. That is right thing. And if I have got doubtful knowledge, perhaps, maybe, why shall I be teacher. I should, ""No, no I cannot teach. The subject is unknown."" That is our process."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes. I must say that I, there are many things of which I haven't got knowledge.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is going on. That is going on. Therefore people are misled."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:No. I would mislead them more if I said that I knew.,Prabhupāda,"No. No, no. If you do not know, why should you say you knew? That is another cheating."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:How do you mean?,Prabhupāda,If... When you know...
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, yes, I don't pretend. If I know something, I say I know, but...",Prabhupāda,"Then you say that..., you say, ""I know."""
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But when I do not know something then I admit that I do not know it.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That admission, that's all right. But in that case, one should not take the post of the teacher. That is our Vedic injunction. One must know perfectly."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:You may well be right. (laughter) But actually, I think there are many things which, about which knowledge is changing. There are things...",Prabhupāda,That means cheating.
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I see you have here, certain bits of equipment which didn't exist...",Prabhupāda,"That is described in the Vedic literature:andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ:[SB7.5.31] ""A blind man is trying to lead other blind men."""
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:I suspect that that is as probably very near to the truth of human situation...,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ.What is the benefit? If I am blind and if there are hundreds of blind men, ""All right, come on, I shall..."""
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:I think we are all partially blind.,Prabhupāda,"No, then there is no question of knowledge. Somebody must be with eyes. He can give knowledge. That is our proposition. As soon as you say blind, there must be somebody with eyes. It is a relative term. It is a relative term. You cannot say, ""all are blind."" Then there is no question of blind and with men eyes. As soon as you accept blind man, you must accept the other side, man with eyes."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, I see. You mean just as you distinguish from white, black because it is different...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, this is relative world."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I agree, but I am using this in, as an example, not as an absolute description. I think my view—may I explain this—of the whole of which I am, as I say, I think, an imperfect part, a part which is trying to learn something which I am not even quite sure what it is that I am trying to learn...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, this is... You are perfect gentleman, means that you say that ""I am imperfect."" That is nice. But our point is that from imperfect man, imperfect knowledge is received. We cannot expect perfect knowledge from imperfect man."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:No. But where does your perfect knowledge come from and how do you recognize it?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is very important point, where to get the perfect knowledge. That is wanted. That is intelligence. Therefore theVedassays,gurumevaabhigacchet:""You go to aguru."" ""Guru"" means heavy, who knows better than you, or who knows perfect. That is injunction."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But, you see, this is...",Prabhupāda,"We have to find out, we have to find out who can give the perfect knowledge."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:How do you know that you know? May I ask this? (laughter),Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:This is the point which, I would find, you know, without disrespect, this is something which is very difficult, whatever kind of faith you have.",Prabhupāda,"It is not the question of faith. Faith may be wrong, belief may be wrong. That perfect knowledge can be received from the perfect source. So God is perfect. God is perfect. And one who follows the path of God, he is also perfect."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But he is different from God, is he not?",Prabhupāda,Maybe. Just like...
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But this is important to me. Can, can...?",Prabhupāda,"The same process. The mother gives the perfect knowledge, and the son receives the knowledge. So the knowledge received from the mother by the son is perfect. The son may not be perfect, but because he has received the knowledge from the mother, which is perfect, therefore he is perfect."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:In what respect do you consider yourself different from God?,Prabhupāda,Do you think I am also equal with God?
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:If you, what I want to know is what you feel your relationship to God is.",Prabhupāda,"My relationship is just like father and the son. The son is not different from the father; at the same time, he is different from the father."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:Yes...,Prabhupāda,"The same relationship. We are all sons of God. Therefore, simultaneously, we are one and different. As son, the ingredient, the same. But he is father, we are son, we are different. This is called the philosophy ofacintya-bhedābheda.Bhedameans different, andabhedameans one. So simultaneously one and different."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:May I ask you another question, which is, I have a mortal father, a man, who you know my parents, father and mother. Do you think that my father is in any way different in his parentage of me from God in His parentage of me.",Prabhupāda,"No, everyone. Not only your father, your grandfather, your, or grandson, the same relationship: simultaneously one and different... Because we are spirit soul and God is the supreme soul. All the souls have come, emanated from Him. He is the supreme soul andParamātmā. The exact word used in the Vedic language,Paramātmā, Parabrahma,Parameśvara. This wordparam.Parammeans supreme."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:I accept that without any trouble. There's no...,Prabhupāda,"The difference is God... In theVedasit is stated that God is just like a person like you and me. Just like we are persons, we are talking face to face, similarly, God is also a person. But... We are also persons. But what is the difference between these two classes of persons."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:Exactly.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, the difference isekoyobahūnāṁvidadhātikāmān.God is the maintainer, the supplier of all necessities of the so many persons. That is God."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, I accept that.",Prabhupāda,"This is the difference. We are maintained, and He is maintainer. That is difference. Otherwise, God is also person, I am also person. One is maintainer and others, the plural number, they are maintained. In the Christian religion also, the same idea is: ""God give us our daily bread,"" maintenance. So that is the difference. He is the bread supplier, and we are bread eater. That's all."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:He doesn't supply his bread to everybody unless...,Prabhupāda,"Everybody, yes, everybody. Beginning..."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:People die, do they not?",Prabhupāda,"Die, that is another thing. People die even if he has got many things to eat, still he dies. Can you check it? That does not depend on eating. There are many men. They are dying. Although they are..."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:I am taking you too literally. Let us forget about that point. It's not worthwhile.,Prabhupāda,"No, no, because you say, ""They are dying, God is not supplying,"" that is a mistaken idea. God is supplying. God is supplying. He is dying natural death. It is not that because there is want of supply, therefore he is dying. That is a mistaken idea. Death is not dependent on supply of food. There are so many other causes."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, yes, I agree about that, but you cannot...",Prabhupāda,"And death is inevitable. Even if you have sufficient to eat, you cannot avoid death. So death is inevitable. That is the problem of material life. Birth, death, old age and disease. So you cannot avoid it. So long you are materially existing. This can be avoided when you are spiritually elevated. That is our movement."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, you cannot live without... You do not, as we say, live by bread alone. And in that sense—it may be the sense in which you wish me to take—the sense, what you are saying, that God supplies bread, because bread could be both bread for the spirit or soul...",Prabhupāda,"No, bread is material. Bread is material. To maintain your material body, you require material bread. But spiritual body does not depend on material bread."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Could we go back to the relationship between you or all of us and God? What my own experience has suggested to me is that the language which I use and the language which has been used by others to describe what we think Him to be is not really capable of accomplishing this very difficult task. It is an impossible task in fact because we are describing something which is so immeasurably greater, more difficult to understand fully. We can have a relationship, but I find it, the language which we use, is of...",Prabhupāda,Insufficient.
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:...of mortal things which are in our experience, and we apply those to something beyond the purely mortal realm, and sometimes the descriptions we use are to be taken only to a certain extent. They are useful as illustrations but they are not to be taken as necessarily a fact. I think this has misled many people when they think about God, that we use a description and it's rather like what we talked about to begin with, the question of names.",Prabhupāda,Question of?
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Names. Yes, I wrote my name for my friend here, and we joked as we came in about how this name should be pronounced. And, of course, it depends how people, how well people know me, which name would apply to me. But I want to go one further than that and I want to say that to know a name or a large number of facts and to be able to make a large number of statements about people is not the same as really knowing this person. And this is our difficulty as I see it in relating ourselves to God, that although we make many statements about Him which are often picturesque ones. We say that He is almighty, that He can, in our religion, move mountains or all sorts of separate statements like that. If you take all those statements together, they wouldn't really describe him at all sufficiently.",Prabhupāda,"Now, suppose one man is engineer. So if I address him ""Mr. engineer,"" what is the wrong?"
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, there is nothing wrong so long as you...",Prabhupāda,"No, this particular name, when I give to him, what is the wrong?"
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:The only thing is that it is not complete.,Prabhupāda,"Why not? That ""engineer"" word completes his situation. He is engineer."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, you might say to me, ""Teacher,"" but that would not be complete. That would not be a complete description",Prabhupāda,"No, it is complete."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:It is true, but it is not complete.",Prabhupāda,"But when it is true, it is complete."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:I don't think so. You see, I could... If I say, ""This wall is white,"" that is a true statement, but it is not a complete statement. Because this wall is not like all white walls. There are many white walls which have not got curves in the corners or decoration at that particular point. Do you understand what I am trying to say?",Prabhupāda,"But when... Just like when we say God,Kṛṣṇa, this word conveys the meaning ""all-attractive."" So what is the wrong? ThisKṛṣṇameans all-attractive. So unless God is all-attractive, how He can become God? It is not that God is for me God. God is for you also. God is for him also. Therefore He must be all-attractive. This is perfect..."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But not necessarily in the same way. Because....,Prabhupāda,"No. Just to understand what is God, if you try to understand in this way that ""God is good,"" ""God is all-attractive,"" is it not perfect?"
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:It is a partial statement.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But it doesn't tell me...,Prabhupāda,"But then, when you go deep into the matter, you understand more and more. In the beginning..."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But you will never, I suspect, here on earth understand...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, that suspicion I have already answered..."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Not for me, you haven't.",Prabhupāda,"...that you have to go through a process, right process. Then there will be no suspicion. The same example. But if you do not go through the process you will be always suspicious."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:When I say, ""suspect,"" what I mean is not anything bad.",Prabhupāda,"No, no, I know that."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:You understand that all I mean is that I am not sure about this. I think it may be true. I'm not sure.,Prabhupāda,That suspicion will continue unless you take the right process.
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But there are, I do not think that this God gave me my mind with my eyes and my sight, hearing, all these factors of the senses, and the intellect and the soul, if we are correctly speaking when we speak of it as something independently existing...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:He did not expect me, I'm sure, not... to reject questions. In my religion, my, must be just as much a part of me as all that my intellect tells me. There must be no question which my religion cannot stand up to.",Prabhupāda,First of all you say that God has given you the intellect. He can withdraw it also.
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, we say not, because...",Prabhupāda,"Why not? If He has given, He can withdraw also."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, I don't... Well, we have a rather strange view of God...",Prabhupāda,"No, you may have strange view. We are arguing. As soon as you say God has given you intellect, He can withdraw also your intellect."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But you see, what we have also to explain—why all men are not good. Now, if God chose, He could force all men to be good, but that is not the way.",Prabhupāda,"No, God has given you intellect to become good, but because you disobey God, you have become bad."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:But if God is all-powerful and He cared to use His power...,Prabhupāda,"No, He does not interfere with your little independence."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:This is the point which you were trying to...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Just like in theBhagavad-gītāGod says that ""You surrender unto Me."" That means, ""If you like, you surrender."" God is not forcing, ""you must."" He is not forcing."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, that's exactly what I meant. We are agreed. And...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So that He does not do. Otherwise, otherwise, there is no meaning of being part and parcel of God. God is fully independent, and we are minute part of God. Therefore we have got independence. That independence is minute, but there is. So if God interferes with your independence, then you are no longer part and parcel of God. Therefore God says that ""You do this."" Now, I misuse my independence. I do not do it. Therefore I am bad."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:Our positions do not differ on this point. We think exactly the same.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. We do not do it. Just like your father says, ""My dear son, do like this,"" but you disobey. Therefore you are bad son. So my badness is creation of my misuse of independence."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:Yes. But it may not be entirely willful.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Because God has given you the intelligence, and as I said, He can withdraw. Just like the same thing: The father said, ""My dear son, do like this."" But he is persisting in doing otherwise."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, and for the same reason that He would not force, would therefore, for the same reason, not withdraw my intellect, having given it to me.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is stated, that is stated, that is stated. Just like I... Withdraw my intellect means I have given you the intellect that ""You do like this."" but you are persistent, doing otherwise, ""All right, as you like, you do."" This is withdrawal."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, yes, but one may be...",Prabhupāda,There is no force. There is no force.
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:No, no. But what I want to go back to is the reason for disobedience. There are various possible ones. One may first not know what one is supposed to do. Secondly... Is that all right? Do you agree about that?",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes. We do not know anything. We are to be considered all fools and rascals. That is our position. As soon as we come to this material world, accept a material body, we are all fools and rascals."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:Do you accept the whole of the material world? Do you think there are some things in it which are wrong?,Prabhupāda,"Just like as soon as you come to the prison house, you are all criminals. You may be very intelligent, but because you are in the prison house, you are criminal. Because you are in the prison house, that is the proof that you are a criminal. You may be very intelligent man."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh yes, I'm not claiming... I haven't any claim to goodness. You must understand that.",Prabhupāda,"Similarly, any living entity, any living entity who is originally part and parcel of God, God is all-good, therefore the part and parcel of God is also all-good. But as soon as comes to the material world, he [break] As exactly like the same, that as soon as one is put into the prison wall, within, he is a criminal. Now he has to undergo the criminal laws. Similarly, because we have come to this material world, we have to undergo the material tribulations. We cannot avoid."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well this is a very long... We are now on a topic on which I should have to require or ask, if I put it more politely, much more time than I have. Now, I am a person with responsibility to my boys. I must go now and say our prayers in the Christian way, which...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, that's nice."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:...Well, we profess up there, which not all believe, but some do, and they must be given their chance. (laughs)",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes, that is nice."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:Will you please excuse me at this moment. I would very much like to come back and pursue this.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you come often. Yes, you are welcome. Yes."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:If you feel it is of any interest or value to you.,Prabhupāda,"Oh yes, yes, After 4 o'clock you can come. You are welcome."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Yes, well, we have a very busy week, because, as I say, we are correcting papers, we are ending our term.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes, you must be busy."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:But what we are talking about is something which doesn't change from today or tomorrow or yesterday. So when these things have been done, perhaps next week, I will come down.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes, you are welcome. I want that responsible persons like you should try to understand the scientific value of this movement. It is not a sentimental movement. It is based on philosophy, science, authority."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, it's on this question of authority, in a sense, that we would have the greatest difficulty. But another time, please.",Prabhupāda,"Well, every religion is authority. That's a fact."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:It is, yes. That's true. But every individual is free and must find for themselves.",Prabhupāda,"No, we, we... Our proposition is, our proposition is thatsavaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo yato bhaktiradhokṣaje[SB1.2.6].""That is first-class religion which teaches the followers how to love God."" This is our proposal."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Well, we shall see. We have a lot to... (laughs) It is quite possible that I too have been sent.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Give him someprasāda.Just wait little. Takeprasādam.Our only fighting is against atheism, godlessness. This is our main fight."
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:I agree.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. People say, ""There is no God, God is dead. This is all humbug."" And so many there are, atheistic proposals. We are giving fight against this atheism."
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, no, no, I must. I have my boys. They wait for me and I must be with them. (laughter)",Prabhupāda,There is someprasādam.
Śyāmasundara:,Śyāmasundara:He is teacher just down the road in the school.,Prabhupāda,You take little this. Yes. Just take little.
Mr. Wadell:,Mr. Wadell:May I take just.,Prabhupāda,Just little. I am not giving you much. (lots of laughter)
Mr. Wadell:,"Mr. Wadell:Oh, it's very good. Just a little.",Prabhupāda,"It is very good, tasteful."

So similarly, if a person understands that he's going to change this body... Just like I'm an old man. I'll have to change in, say, immediately, or say five years, ten years. But the notice is already there because I am old man. So it is my duty to think: ""Then what body I'm going to take next?"" That is intelligence. And we have to prepare for that.
