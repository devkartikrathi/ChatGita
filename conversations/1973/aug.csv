Yogeśvara,Excuse me?,Prabhupāda,That the animal-eater is going to become a tiger to get more facility.
Yogeśvara,He liked the example.,Prabhupāda,"Well, that is fact.Yaṁyaṁvāpismaranbhāvaṁtyajatyantekalevaram...[Bg.8.6]. Animal-eaters, they'll become tiger, fox, cats, dogs. This is, they'll become. What are these different species of life?"
Yogeśvara,"They do not, they do not accept that the soul exists below the human level.",Prabhupāda,"And that is their foolishness. That is their foolishness. Why does not exist? What is the proof of existence of the soul in the body? What is the proof? First of all, you have to understand that. Suppose I am a human being, so..."
Yogeśvara,(to driver) You know where to go?,Prabhupāda,"I am a human being. You accept that I have got soul. By what symptoms you accept that I have got soul? First of all you have to ascertain that. What is the symptom that we agree that I am human being. I have got, I am a soul. By what characteristic, analytical study, you accept that I have got soul, and the dog has not got soul? What are the different characteristics? First of all, we have to enumerate that thing. If we find in the characteristics, then we can say there is no soul. But if we see that both the animal and the human being have the same characteristics of living condition, then how you can say the animal has not soul?"
Yogeśvara,His point was that the animals don't show the same symptoms. They don't think as...,Prabhupāda,"Why not, why not? The general symptom is animal eats, you eat, animal sleeps, you sleep, animal has sex, you have got sex, animal also defends, you also defend. Where is the difference?"
Yogeśvara,"His point was that human beings, they think on higher platforms than animals do.",Prabhupāda,"What that higher platform? Eating, you require to maintain the body. I eat something, you eat another. That does not mean higher or lower. You eat, I also eat. That's all. You eat according to your taste. I eat according to my taste. So the eating is the real symptom, not the varieties of eating. By varieties of eating, suppose I... A animal, the cow is eating grass, and you are eating the same animal by keeping a huge slaughterhouse with machines and... Does it mean that you have improved your eating process? Simply by having big, big machine and ghastly scenes. And the animal eats simple grass. Does it mean that you are advanced than the animals? There is no logic. Eating is eating. One man's food, another man's poison. That is another thing. But eating is there. Somebody eats poison. Somebody eats ordinary thing. But eating is there. So nobody can avoid eating. That is the main symptom. Even in human society, there are different varieties of food. We Indians, we like a different type of dish. European, Americans, they like a di... But eating is there. Either American, Indian or cats, dogs, eating must be there. That is real symptom. After eating, you must sleep. That is essential. So where is the difference of real character, characteristic between the animals and the human beings?"
Yogeśvara,"Then his point was that we find God's creatures, many of them, not just human beings, but it's a symptom of life everywhere that meat-eating is allowed. There are many creations, he said, many species...",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. Eating, that is another thing. First of all, if the, point is that you say that the animals have no soul. So what is the special point that you are speaking of the animals having no soul? You eat meat, or I eat rice, that doesn't matter, but eating is there. That is the common thing. You cannot say the animal does not eat or man does not eat. Only animal eats. No. Everyone eats. First of all, you enunciate: how do you say that the human being has got soul and the animal has not soul? What are the special symptoms?"
Yogeśvara,"His, his point was that only in humans do we find a metaphysical search for the meaning of life.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yogeśvara,And that's the only difference.,Prabhupāda,"The metaphysical search... Now metaphysically search out why do you deny soul in the human being, uh, in the animals? That is metaphysical. It is metaphysical question. What is your metaphysical study about the living, uh, animals that you say there is no soul? Come to the metaphysical then. You are thinking metaphysically. That's all right. But if you are still thinking like animal, then what is the use of your metaphysical studies? If you are thinking like the animals: ""Where shall I get my food? Where shall I take shelter? Where shall I have sexual facility? How shall I defend?"" If you are thinking like that, this is animal thinking. Metaphysical thinking means beyond this, beyond this thinking of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. That is metaphysical thinking. So what you are thinking beyond that? That is God consciousness. When a human being thinks about God, that is metaphysical. When he thinks like animals about eating, sleeping, mating and defending, that is not metaphysical. Metaphysical. What do you mean by metaphysical? How to define? What is the meaning of ""meta""? Above physical. That means spiritual. So if you think spiritually, then you'll see. Just likeBhagavad-gītā,Kṛṣṇaclaims:sarva-yoniṣukaunteya[Bg.14.4].""In all forms of life, the living entities are there, and they are My sons."" So this is metaphysical, or if some third-class man says that there is no soul in the animal, that is metaphysical? Which one is metaphysical?Kṛṣṇaspeaking will be metaphysical, or a third-class fool's statement will be taken as metaphysical? Which one is metaphysical? First of all say me."
Yogeśvara,"Then he made the point that in a place like India it's foolish where so many people are dying of starvation, not to kill the cow on some religious principle.",Prabhupāda,"That is another story. No Indians are dying, not by eating cow's flesh. That, that is the theory at the present moment given. But there are so many vegetarians in India. They do not touch even fish, or eggs, or animal flesh. They're quite healthy. It does not mean..."
Yogeśvara,"I think his answer would be that vegetarianism is reserved to the rich people who can afford it. That if you're poor, you have to eat whatever you can get.",Prabhupāda,"Well. Now in India, meat is selling at high price than vegetable. Yes."
Yogeśvara,He said now in India meat is selling at a higher price than vegetables.,Prabhupāda,That is no logic.
Yogeśvara,Not logic.,Prabhupāda,"Price of meat is higher than milk and vegetables. So in that consideration, why not take vegetable and milk. Why you go to meat? So she is driving taxi, girls also drive taxi?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:In New York City, they also drive taxi.",Prabhupāda,Girls?
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Yes. They get more business. (end),Prabhupāda,...this is the third time.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,I have come here today. (heavy static) [break] Vṛndāvana.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes sir.,Prabhupāda,You knowVṛndāvana?
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:In the north, north India.",Prabhupāda,North India.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:North India, North India. You have here the center of your...?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, I have got my center here."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"Yes. What is the address, our center?"
Yogeśvara,Yes.,Prabhupāda,We shall install Deity tomorrow morning. So...
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, you...",Prabhupāda,Have you got time to attend?
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Nine o'clock, nine o' clock. Nine o'clock is perhaps difficult.",Prabhupāda,Nine...
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Nine, it is...",Prabhupāda,"Nine to twelve, the ceremony..."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Ah, nine to twelve. Perhaps. In the end of the morning, perhaps it is... It is an inauguration, inauguration?",Prabhupāda,Yes. Deity installation.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Especially on Indian music, Indian music. He live many years in Benares.",Prabhupāda,Benares.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Benares. Fifteen years. Fifteen years in Benares.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, he was in fifteen years?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oh, yes, a very long time. Oh yes. Very long time. Yes. And after he, he worked in Pondicherry and each year he comes in India. Yes. Yes. He's very well known in India for his works, especially about Indian music, but also Indian spirituality, the yogas, Indian gods and all question concerning India. Yes.",Prabhupāda,Where he is now?
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:He's now inRome, inRome, inRome. He, he had especially in Greece language not in French. He lived inRome, in Berlin. You visited Italy, Italy yourself?",Prabhupāda,Not yet.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:No. Not yet, not yet. France. France...",Prabhupāda,I've got invitation from the secretary...
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, very acquainted with Indian philosophy and religion. He read very well Sanskrit and...",Prabhupāda,"Oh, he knows Sanskrit?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oh, yes, oh yes. He knows very, very well, oh, very well. He speaks Indian modern language, Hindi, Bengali, and Tamil.",Prabhupāda,Bengali?
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Tamil.,Prabhupāda,I am Bengali.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:It is...,Prabhupāda,He's a linguist scholar.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, very scholar. It is first time you visit France?",Prabhupāda,This is the third time.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,So our Vedic conception of politics. The king is the representative of God.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes.,Prabhupāda,King.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:King, yes.",Prabhupāda,In theBhagavad-gītā...(Aside) Bring glass of water.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, I understand, very well I understand some...",Prabhupāda,"The king, this creation, God created this material world. What is the purpose? What is the purpose of creation? There must be some plan. When you manufacture something, do something, there must be plan. So what is the plan behind this cosmic manifestation?"
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes. What is this plant like? Yes. Yes sir. Yes.,Prabhupāda,What Christianity says about this plan?
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui.You understand, you understand what I say? Or not very well? (French)",Prabhupāda,"So the creation... We are, we all living entities, we are also part and parcel of God."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Oui.,Prabhupāda,Just like this finger...
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, is a...",Prabhupāda,Part and parcel of this body. Similarly everything...
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Is a part.,Prabhupāda,Part and parcel of God.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So the part and parcel of the God, the living entity, it's business is to render service to God."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, yes. I agree, I agree.",Prabhupāda,"Just like this finger is part and parcel of my body, but its business is to serve the body. I ask the finger: ""Come here."" It is doing like that. I ask the finger to: ""Come here."" It is doing like that. So it is the business of the finger is to serve the whole. It is part. And the body is the whole. Therefore the business of the part and parcel is to serve, render service to the whole. This is natural condition."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:I agree with this...,Prabhupāda,Let me finish.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes. And I think that the vocation of each creature is the service of God, yes.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:The service of God.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So when the living entity forgets this business, that is material life."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:(agrees in French),Prabhupāda,Therefore in this material world we find almost everyone has forgotten God.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:(agrees in French),Prabhupāda,The conclusion is that this material world is created...
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Created...,Prabhupāda,Created for the forgotten souls.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes.,Prabhupāda,And here the business is to again revive them to God consciousness.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So the process of enlightening the living entities, especially the human being, because in the animal form of life, one cannot be enlightened. Neither the animal can understand what is God."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"It is only the human being who can understand. If he's trained, then he can come to God consciousness."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, yes, yes, It is so.",Prabhupāda,So this creation is meant for the forgotten souls to give them a chance for reviving their God consciousness.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, it is clear. It is very, very clear. Very clear.",Prabhupāda,"And for this business, sometimes God personally comes. Sometimes He sends His representative, His son, or His devotee, His servant. This is going on. God wants that these forgotten souls should come back to home, back to Godhead."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore from His side, that is constant endeavor to revive their God consciousness."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, God consciousness.",Prabhupāda,"Now this God consciousness can be awakened in the human form of life, not in other form of life."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Not in the...,Prabhupāda,"Maybe very rarely, but the human being... (aside:) Where is the water?"
Yogeśvara,She said she was coming with it...,Prabhupāda,Ācchā.The human being has got the prerogative to awaken his dormant God consciousness.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes.,Prabhupāda,So the best service to humanity is to awaken their God consciousness.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, it is true, it is true.",Prabhupāda,Best service.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:It is the necessity of internal conversion, yes, for human, human souls to return to God. But do you think that this, the personality of human soul is a personality permanent? That is, we remain always distinct, not separate from God, but distinct of God?",Prabhupāda,Distinct.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Distinct of God. Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Just like you are distinct from me, I am distinct from you."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,Like that.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:We are distinct from God in a certain sense.,Prabhupāda,"But as I am the individual being, similarly God is also individual being."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Individual being, yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Being. That is the Vedic statement,nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām,ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13).God is also a living entity."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Living, God is living.",Prabhupāda,Living entity.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Living, living.",Prabhupāda,"And we are also living entities. But He's singular number, we are plural number."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:But do you think that really God love human beings and...?,Prabhupāda,God loves...
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Love...,Prabhupāda,...every living entity.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:God love, love, love...",Prabhupāda,"Not only human beings, but also..."
Yogeśvara,Is this creation...?,Prabhupāda,"When, when the living entity forgets love of God, he's given this material world."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes. Is true. The man must imitate God, imitating His bounty, His...",Prabhupāda,Power.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes. His mind and His knowledge of the spiritual sense. But it is possible to man without the helping of God to realize his perfection?,Prabhupāda,"No, no, no."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:It is necessary that the grace of God help the...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. By the help of God, he can revive. That is stated inCaitanya-caritāmṛta..."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Because man is, himself, is not capable to attain...",Prabhupāda,No.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:...the divinity.,Prabhupāda,By the help ofKṛṣṇa...
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:(aside in French),Prabhupāda,"By the help of God, and by the help of master, spiritual master..."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes. Spiritual master.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Spiritual master is very important. Theguru, you say, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Guru, yes. That is the very word used.Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāyapāyabhakti-latā-bīja[Cc.Madhya19.151].One revives his God consciousness by the mercy of God andguru."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, in Christianity, we speak of spiritual fathers.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Spiritual father, spiritual father. We... He is a man who has a good experience of spiritual things and communicate his experience to others.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, oh, yes. (etc.)"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:You know. We are in Christianity monks, monks. We live in monastery.",Prabhupāda,"Ah, monks."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Monastery, yes. With contemplative life and austerity of life. And we have many, many monastery in France. Some Benedict, some Benedict and...",Prabhupāda,"Where he has gone to take the water from, Arabian Sea?"
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:...leader of theKṛṣṇacommunity?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes. But there are in India other community ofViṣṇu...?",Prabhupāda,"The same, the same."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:The same.,Prabhupāda,"KṛṣṇaandViṣṇu, the same."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,So material world is meant for persons...
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Thanks.,Prabhupāda,You can give me little more. Yes.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:You are in India today a religious life, or...?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, I'msannyāsī."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:But there is no, no atheism, literate, some atheism, atheism, atheism, religious indifference, materialists exist in the towns, in the towns...?",Prabhupāda,Now there are many atheists.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Many atheists, yes. In France, we have this problem. In France, the greatest parts of the, of, of children are baptized and trained...",Prabhupāda,Give me little more.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:In France, the greatest part of children are baptized and receive a religious education, the religious training, the great part. The atheism is chiefly, amongst intellectuals. Not...",Prabhupāda,Ah! Not in the mass.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Not in the... No, not in the mass.",Prabhupāda,The same thing....
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes. Yes. But it is not the majority of the young men and this revolutionary spirit is amongst many youths, some research, research of the Absolute. Some young men are communist and Marxist, surely. But many youths, today have a spirit of research factually. In, insatisfied with actual religious forms, but receives any religious experience, a spiritual experience...",Prabhupāda,That is the latest thing. They are now disgusted with these religious rituals without philosophy.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui, oui,it is so, it is so. They have accepted some formalism, ritualism. They do not like this. But receives a personal and internal experience.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yogeśvara,He says the ideal of Christianity is to imitate these various qualities of Lord Jesus Christ.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes. And Jesus, Jesus is this. So I am very, very glad to meet you...",Prabhupāda,"May, may I ask you one question? Jesus says: ""Thou shalt not kill."" So why Christian people are killing?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:It is forbidden in Christianity to kill. Surely. But chiefly we think that there is a difference between the life of man and the life the beasts.N'est ce pas?And that the life of man is sacred because man is the image of God. But we have not the same respect relating to the beasts, to the animals, and we think that the animals are at the service of man, and that it islegitimeto man. For us, each life is not the same. What is really important is the life of man, and the human person is really sacred and it is forbidden to kill a human person...",Prabhupāda,"No, but Jesus does not says ""human being"". He just said generally: ""Thou shalt not kill."""
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:(French) In the Bible we have many example of, by example, we have many sacrifice in the sacrifice of animals. You know. Many sacrifice of animals in the Bible.Alors.This is not forbidden. It is sure that it is a great sin to kill a man,alors.There is surely the great question of the war, the war, the national war. And is, it is...",Prabhupāda,"You, you, you think that to kill an animal is no sin?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:No, no, no. No sin. No sin. No sin. Because we think that the simple biologic life is not sacred. That is, what is sacred is the human life, the human life. But not the life, ass.",Prabhupāda,"But I think that it is interpretation. Jesus Christ says generally: ""Thou shalt not kill."""
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes. Jesus said, but this phrase is not, the text is not a text of Jesus. It is a text of theOld Testament,and it is a text...",Prabhupāda,"No, it isNew Testamentalso."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Old Testament! Old Testament.,Prabhupāda,"No, is it not in theNew Testament?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:It is in theLevitic,in theLevitic,in the book of theLevitic.",Prabhupāda,Ahhh.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:It is not a word of Jesus. It is a word of theLevitic,and it is a part of the decalogue of the Ten Commandments what God gave to Moses.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. But Ten Commandments, one of the Commandments is that: ""Thou shalt no kill."""
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui.For the food of man to eat, to eat, and...",Prabhupāda,"Man can eat grains, food grains, fruits, milk, sugar, wheat..."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:No flesh?,Prabhupāda,"No. Why? Just like the fruits. The fruits are meant for human being. The tiger does not come to eat your fruits. So tiger's food is another animal. Man's food is fruit, food grains, milk products. Just like fruit..."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes. I understand. It is why because grain and plants are also living beings.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right, that's all right."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Living beings.,Prabhupāda,"That, that we also understand. But if, if you cannot live... Just like, generally, if I can live on fruits and grains and milk, why should I kill another animal?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes...",Prabhupāda,Another thing is that how can you support that animal killing is not sin?
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, because we, we thought that there is a difference of nature between life of man, life of spirit, and biological, biological life. And we say... [break] ...not really exists, and we think so. We think that animals, plant are not real beings, are world of appearance and that you human person only is real being. And that in this sense, the material world is without importance.",Prabhupāda,"Now..., I follow. Suppose you are living in this house. So you are not this house, that's a fact."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes. Yes.,Prabhupāda,"But if I come and break your house, is it not inconvenience for you?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, surely. Surely it is inconvenient.",Prabhupāda,"So if I cause inconvenience unto you, is it not criminal?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:It is inconvenient to me, but is...",Prabhupāda,"No. If I cause some inconvenience to you, is it not criminal? Is it not sinful?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui,the cows.",Prabhupāda,One thing is...
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:...a cow to give him to children who are hungry and the...,Prabhupāda,"No, no, from any other consideration, cows' milk we drink. Therefore she's mother. Is it not?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui,yes, surely, surely, but the...",Prabhupāda,"According to Vedic conversion, we have got seven mothers.Ātma-mātā,the original mother,guroḥpatnī,wife of the master, spiritual master..."
Yogeśvara,(translates),Prabhupāda,"Ātma-mātāguroḥpatnībrāhmaṇī,the wife of the priest."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:,Prabhupāda,"Rāja-patnikā,the wife of king, the queen."
Yogeśvara,(translates),Prabhupāda,"Four.Ātma-mātāguroḥpatnībrāhmaṇīrāja-patnikā, dhenur.Dhenumeans cow.Dhenurdhātrī.Dhātrīmeans nurse.Tathāpṛthvī.Pṛthvīmeans earth. These are seven mothers. So cow is mother because we drink milk, cow's milk."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes.,Prabhupāda,How can I deny that she's not mother? So how we can support killing of mother?
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, it is a motive. But we think that...",Prabhupāda,"Therefore, in India, those who are meat-eaters, they are advised... That is also under restriction. Advised to kill some lower animals like goats, even up to buffaloes. But cow killing is the greatest sin."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, we... I know this. I know this. And this is for us a difficulty, a difficulty...",Prabhupāda,"Yes, because the cow is mother."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, yes...",Prabhupāda,"You, you take the milk from the mother..."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"And when she's old, she cannot give you milk, therefore she should be killed?"
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Is that very good proposal?
Yogeśvara,"He says yes, it is.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:If, if the men are hungry, it is the life of men is more important than the life of cow.",Prabhupāda,"Therefore, because we are propagating thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness, we ask people to, not to eat meat, any kind."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"But if, under certain circumstances, you are obliged to eat meat, eat the flesh of some lower animals. Don't kill cows. It is the greatest sin. And so long one will be sinful, he'll not be able to understand what is God. But human being, main business is to understand God and to love Him. But if he remains sinful, neither he can understand God, and what to, what is the question of loving Him. Therefore at least from the human society, this cruel maintenance of slaughterhouses must be stopped."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui, oui.I think that this is perhaps not an essential point. I think that in this realm the uses of various religions can be good. The importance is to love God.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:But the commandment practical can be various.,Prabhupāda,"No. Just like God, if God says that: ""You can do this,"" that is not sin. But if God says that: ""You cannot do it"", then it is sin."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:When God says that it is not good to Indian, and says to the Jews that it is...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Now take... Therefore I say that Jesus Christ, either you call him God, or confidential representative of God, both of them are one, when he says: ""Thou shalt not kill,"" why should we interpret in an another way, to our convenience?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui,the sheeps...",Prabhupāda,"That's all right, but Jesus Christ never maintained slaughterhouse."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Non, mais...He eated, he eated, he eated...",Prabhupāda,"In certain circumstances, when there is no other food, that a life must be saved. That is another thing. But why regularly slaughterhouse should be maintained for the satisfaction of the tongue?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui.But I think there is, at first, a great duty to help men and women and children to live and actually it is the first duty. It is more important to help men and women to life. The life of beast is of minor importance than the life of men.",Prabhupāda,"From that point of view, you can kill lower animals. Why should you kill mother?"
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Oui, oui.Mother. Man, as human being is not the same that...",Prabhupāda,"And it is not moral. Even if you kill animals for maintaining your..., allowing that, there are many other, hundreds and thousands of animals. So if you at all require, people eat also hogs, sometimes, in wartime, they ate dogs also. And there are persons, they regularly eat dogs in Korea. They eat dogs regularly. So even animal killing is necessary for..."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, yes, it is...",Prabhupāda,"...for eating, then at least the mother animal should not be killed. That is from moral point of view."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, from moral point of view...",Prabhupāda,"So our point of view is that we don't allow killing any animal. OurKṛṣṇasays:patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyaṁyo mebhaktyāprayacchati[Bg.9.26].Kṛṣṇasays vegetable, fruits, milk, grains, all these things should be offered to Me with devotion. And you should take the remnants of the foodstuff. So we takeprasādam.AndKṛṣṇasays: ""Give Me foodstuff prepared from this group."" That we do. Accepting that the fruits, they have got life. But fruits are by nature... There are many fruits. It is offered by the tree for eating. The tree's not killed. So we accept this philosophy also that a, one animal, one living entity is meant for being food for another living entity.Jīvojīvasyajīvanam.That we also accept, but that does not mean one living entity is the food for another living entity, that does not mean I can kill my mother, my child... That is not, sir. So at least this must be taken into consideration that cows, innocent, they give us milk, we take its milk, and we kill in regular slaughterhouse, this is not very good thing. It is sinful."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:Yes. I understand that.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Thank you very much.
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:The soul, the soul, the soul is, is human soul. In the animal you have some psychologic existence, but not life of spirit with freedom, with mind and with the reality of spirit. But you have the same idea because you said that there is a difference of nature between spiritual creation and the material world. You know, the material world is not of the same essence than the spiritual world. And the man, the man is a part of spiritual world.",Prabhupāda,"No. OurBhagavad-gītāsays:sarva-yoniṣu.""In all species of life, as many forms are there, so the spirit soul is there."" This outward body is just like a dress. You may have a very costly dress, and I may have a very shabby, poor dress, but both of us are human being, or living entities. Similarly these different forms of living entities, they are just like different types of dress.Vāsāṁsijīrṇāniyathāvihāya[Bg.2.22].Just like you are in black dress. I am in saffron dress..."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yellow, yes.",Prabhupāda,"So this is external. But within the dress you are a human being, I am also human being. Similarly, there are eight million four hundred thousands of dresses. There are nine hundred thousand dresses within the water, aquatics."
Yogeśvara,(translates),Prabhupāda,"Similarly, two million kinds of dresses of the trees, plants, like that. In this way the Vedic literatures have calculated, there are eight million, four hundred thousand forms of living entity. But they're all living entities, part and parcel of God. Just like one man has got ten sons. Not all of them equally meritorious. Not all. One may be high-court judge. And one may be ordinary clerk in the office. But father, both the high-court judge and the clerk in the office, father claims both of them as son."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:Yes, yes, I agree.",Prabhupāda,"For father, there is no such distinction that: ""This high-court judge is very important and the clerk in the office, my son, he's not important."" So if the enlightened son, high-court judge, says to the father: ""My dear father, your, this son, is useless. Let me cut him and eat."" Will the father allow?"
Yogeśvara,(translates),Prabhupāda,"Apart from this consideration, at least this morality should be observed that cows, they're our mother. We should not kill at least mothers for eating the flesh."
Cardinal Danielou:,Cardinal Danielou:The difficulty for us is not the idea that it is good for us to respect the life of a cow. The difficulty is the metaphysic reason. You know.,Prabhupāda,"No, metaphysics, not..."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:No. Without, without, impermanent. Life of man is permanent.",Prabhupāda,"That, that, that difference is due to development of consciousness. The human body, human body, you get developed consciousness. Just like this tree. It is also a living entity, but it's consciousness is not yet fructified. If you cut the tree, it does not resist. But it resists in a very small degree. That is proved by the scientists. The Sir JagadishaCandraBose, in Calcutta, he's also a very great scientist. He has made machine: when you cut the tree, it feels and it is recorded in the machine."
Yogeśvara,(translates),Prabhupāda,"And for the animals we can see, when one kills the animals, it resists, it cries, it makes great sound, horrible. So it is the question of development of consciousness. But the, a soul is there."
Cardinal Danielou:,"Cardinal Danielou:But, why, why, why God make some animals who eat other animals? There is a fault in the creation because... It is a fault in the creation?",Prabhupāda,"No. The God is very kind. If you want to eat animals, then He'll give facility, good facility. Just like tiger. You become tiger, and eat animals. Those who are animal eaters, unrestrictedly, God will give him the body of a tiger next life so that he can very freely eat. ""Why you maintain slaughterhouse? I give you nails and jaws. Just eat."" So they are waiting that life."
Guest:,"Guest:That is the... Yeah, the source of the Absolute. That is the best. But I read it twenty times, always with, in every day I find new things.",Prabhupāda,That is...
Guest:,"Guest:When I read other book, I read it one times, even not one time. But these books, I must read twenty times, and more even. It is, sometimes, it is, if I never read this book, it is so astonishing...",Prabhupāda,Get new light.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:He wants to know if Christian, Christian teachings also bring the same consciousness,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness?",Prabhupāda,Yes. One has to become...
Guest:,Guest:(German),Prabhupāda,...purified.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:No, no, no. He says that in the Bible it says one should not make an image of God.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Guest:,"Guest:Neither a picture of Him nor a likeness, likeness",Prabhupāda,So why they have got image of Christ?
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:(German conversation),Prabhupāda,"Why, why they keep Lord Jesus Christ's picture?"
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:(German conversation),Prabhupāda,"No, what is the philosophy. I am asking. What is the philosophy of keeping...?"
Guest:,Guest:(laughs),Prabhupāda,Then why do you object of Kṛṣṇa's form.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:Oh, the Deities. He cannot understand the Deities, that we are worshiping the Deity.",Prabhupāda,"Deity, that is image ofKṛṣṇa."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:That is (German conversation),Prabhupāda,It is the same principle. Why they should object having Kṛṣṇa's form.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:He says, it looks to him, it appears to him like a doll.",Prabhupāda,Doll?
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:He says the Deities always have such big eyes. The Deities, have, They are always looking with such big eyes. He cannot understand.",Prabhupāda,Big eyes? Big eyes is very fearful to him?
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:(German conversation),Prabhupāda,These are different mentalities. It is not very scientific.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Shall I explain to him about Deity worship?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,Guest:Maharishi MaheshYogiandMaharsi...,Prabhupāda,(To Śrutakīrti) Don't make this coming and going always. There is no other way for going down?
Śrutakīrti:,"Śrutakīrti:No, we just had to find something. We... There was something in your bathroom we needed. This thing here... But we, we won't be using this at all.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest:,Guest:(German),Prabhupāda,The spiritual master is the representative of God.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:(translates),Prabhupāda,"So if he speaks what God speaks, then he's spiritual master, otherwise, he's a bogus."
Guest:,Guest:(German),Prabhupāda,So MaheshYogidoes not speak of God. Therefore he's bogus.
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:He wants to know if you, if you think that you will be able to complete all the volumes ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamwhich you have projected.",Prabhupāda,Why not?
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:He says, if you have anything, you can instruct him. Otherwise...",Prabhupāda,I will instruct you to chantHareKṛṣṇamantra.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:How often? He wants...?,Prabhupāda,Twenty-four hours.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:(German conversation),Prabhupāda,"HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare,HareRāmaHare... Then everything will be revealed to you."
Guest:,Guest:Yaḥ. Good.,Prabhupāda,Thank you very much.
Guest:,Guest:Thank you.,Prabhupāda,HareRāma...HareKṛṣṇa. (end) ...there are many groups like that in America.
Devotee:,Devotee:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Like imitating Beatle groups.
Devotee:,Devotee:Allen Ginsberg.,Prabhupāda,Allen Ginsberg. Allen Ginsberg has no more popularity.
Devotee:,"Devotee:No, not much.",Prabhupāda,"He's roaming like vagabond. He came, London, to see me. That... He came, also. What is that? Bob...?"
Yogeśvara,Bob Dylan?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yogeśvara,"You mean in London, in London.",Prabhupāda,No. He came to Los Angeles.
Devotee:,Devotee:And He came to see Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda,"No, he came to our temple in Los Angeles and paid three hundred dollars to the Deity."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Oh, that's nice.",Prabhupāda,Some jewels.
Yogeśvara,"That's nice. He's the most popular young poet in the United States, Bob Dylan. All the young people have his records.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bhagavān,"Tonight there's a meeting scheduled at six-thirty here. There's a big professor of philosophy, it's called the Sorbonne. Have you ever heard of this school? The Sorbonne? It's the big French University. So he called, he requested if you would see him tonight. So we set appointment for six-thirty.",Prabhupāda,"So ŚivānandaPrabhu, you are doing well? Your wife came to see me. [break]"
Yogeśvara,"Mr. Rougemont is a journalist from Combat magazine, newspaper. Combat is the newspaper of the socialists of France. Political newspaper, and Mr. Rougemont had some questions about the political and government programs of the Society.",Prabhupāda,Very nice.
Reporter:,Reporter:You accept to answer my questions?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Reporter:,"Reporter:Oui.I've heard that... It's a mistake. And your movement, your consciousness ofKṛṣṇa, engloves, takes all the direction of economics and political possibility.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Reporter:,"Reporter:Can you speak, explain me about that?",Prabhupāda,Yes. Our aim is realization of God.
Yogeśvara,(from this pointYogeśvaratranslates some of the dialogue),Prabhupāda,"And to get help for this realization we are concerned with everything. Naturally, politics, economics, science, art, philosophy, everything is included. And that is the perfection of all other subject matter. Everything has got an objective. So any of these departmental knowledge, namely politics, economics, art, science, philosophy, religion, art, science, philosophy, religion, everything should be aimed to achieve this end, God realization."
Reporter:,"Reporter:But, thank you. But, uh, so, in this way, you have to, in all of the science, you mean, economic, politic, etc., you have to take position, sometimes perhaps. For instance, for going to the knowing ofKṛṣṇain politics perhaps you will choose one system or the other. And in science, in philosophy, etc. Do you... But this, those choose have never been explained to the people, you know.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, it should be."
Reporter:,Reporter:It should be. Have you...?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, we, we, we have explained it in our book,ŚrīmadBhāgavatam,wherever possibility. Find out that verse:kāmam,kāmaṁvavarṣaparjanyaḥ[SB1.10.4].Find out this verse."
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:It's in First Canto?,Prabhupāda,Yes.Kāmaṁvavarṣaparjanyaḥ[SB1.10.4].You can...
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:Kāmaṁvavarṣaparjanyaḥ?,Prabhupāda,Oh.
Śrutakīrti:,Śrutakīrti:,Prabhupāda,"Now here is economics, politics and everything. So byKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement we want to see that everyone is getting nicely the necessities of life. That is economic. Is it not?"
Reporter:,"Reporter:It is economic in a very, in a very...",Prabhupāda,"Brotherhood. Actually, we develop economics for getting the necessities of life. Is it not? That is economics."
Reporter:,"Reporter:Yeah. But the point is that these necessities of life is a frontier, you know, (indistinct) which is always farther, and farther and farther, always more pushed, pushed away, pushed away by new things. So...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. That is artificial. That is artificial. We are not concerned with artificial things. Just like you require to eat. Now artificially you can increase so many things for eating purposes. But you must eat. That is the economic question. It is not that you should starve. It is not our proposal that you becomeKṛṣṇaconscious by starving. No. You must have sufficient necessities of life."
Reporter:,"Reporter:All right. So... The purpose for economic plan of all the planet, for the world would be everybody can eat, and I suppose just, just eating and some clothes and some roof to be, if you are in a cold country...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Eating, sleeping... Sleeping requires roof, apartment. So it includes your housing, your eating, your sex urge, and your defence. Everything should be nicely... So arrangement should be made that people are not harassed for these necessities of life."
Reporter:,Reporter:And all the rest is superfluous. Is too much.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Reporter:,"Reporter:All the rest is superficial, is superficial.",Prabhupāda,What is superficial?
Yogeśvara,Anything beyond these four basics is...,Prabhupāda,"That is necessities of life. Because you have got this body, so you must supply the necessities of the body. That we supply. Not only that. We want to keep men in so peaceful condition that he's not disturbed by mental anxieties, bodily disease, natural disturbances and fighting or quarreling with other living entities. So when he's perfectly in peaceful condition of life, he can save time for advancement in spiritual consciousness."
Reporter:,"Reporter:Sure, so...",Prabhupāda,"But aim is that his life, everyone's life is meant for spiritual realization. So to, in order to achieve this end of life he must be kept in peaceful condition of life."
Yogeśvara,"He asks: ""In order to achieve these goals is it our intention to do like the Christians and make everyone convert toKṛṣṇaconsciousness?""",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Yogeśvara,"In order to achieve our goals, do we intend doing like the Christians tried to do, making everyone convert to their side. Is that what we want to do, make everyone convert toKṛṣṇa?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Why not? IfKṛṣṇaconsciousness is good, why everyone should not take to it?"
Yogeśvara,"Ah. This is an important question. He says seeing the world as it is today, what is the most preferable social organization from theKṛṣṇaconscious point of view?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Yogeśvara,How should society be organized in order to achieve these goals?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You organize that there should be division of different classes of men. The first class men, the second class men, the third class men, fourth class men. The first-class men means the most intelligent class of men. Second-class men means those who are dealing in politics. Third-class men means those who are dealing in economics, industry, trade. And fourth-class men means they have no intelligence to take up all these things, but they work only. But all of them should cooperate. For the general benefit of the whole human society. We have got engagement for the first-class men, second-class men, third-class men, fourth-class men. Just like we have got in our body the brain, the arms, the belly, and the legs. But all of them are cooperating for keeping the body fit. Similarly, the first-class, second-class, third-class, fourth-class men should cooperate for achieving the end,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Bhagavān,It's not that one class is feeling exploited by another class.,Prabhupāda,"No. No. Helping. Just like when there is some pain in my leg. My brain is working how to cure it. It is helping. It is not exploiting. Similarly, my brain wants to go somewhere to see something. My leg is helping to carry me there. Just like you wanted to see me. Your brain said that: ""I must see this man."" Your leg carried you. This is cooperation. You have got some capacity. You do it for the benefit of the society so that he may becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. This, this plan is perfect socialism. Socialism, socialism means everyone is working for elevation of everyone toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Because that is the highest perfection of life."
Reporter:,"Reporter:No, I think it's all right. You have a speech tomorrow? You will have a speech tomorrow?",Prabhupāda,Where?
Bhagavān,Here. In the afternoon you are scheduled to...,Prabhupāda,Yes. What is the subject matter? Any (indistinct).
Bhagavān,As you like.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So it is the most refined socialism.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness movement... Our socialism means centering aroundKṛṣṇa. Just like Russian socialism is around the ideas of Marx or Lenin. So we have got also similar leader. As the communist has got the leader, Marx or Lenin, similarly we have also got the leader,Kṛṣṇa."
Bhagavān,"There is, there is kind of socialist or communist philosophy that says that everyone must be able to do the same work in order to be equal.",Prabhupāda,"That is not possible. That is rascaldom. We have divided already four classes of men. Even in Russia... Even in Russia, I have seen, they have created two classes, the worker class, the manager class. I have seen it. Yes. So you cannot say that everyone will do the same work. That is not possible. I have given already the example, the brain, the arms, the abdomen and the leg. The leg cannot do the work of brain. Leg can cooperate with the brain, but cannot do the work of brain. This is natural position."
Yogeśvara,He asks: In our society do these four divisions also exist?,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Yogeśvara,"In ISKCON, are there these four divisions?",Prabhupāda,"No, we are transcendental to all these material divisions. This is material division."
Yogeśvara,"In that case, in which of these four divisions are we?",Prabhupāda,"First-class. That is the beginning. But we go above the first-class. [break] Similarly, socially also, you must have four divisions. The reason is the material nature is working under three divisions, goodness, passion and ignorance. In our body also, the brain is working under goodness quality. The arm is working under the influence of passion. The belly is working in between passion and ignorance. And the leg is working under ignorance. Leg cannot work unless there is direction by the brain. At the present moment, the society's working under the influence of passion and ignorance. The brain is lacking now. Therefore we are creatingKṛṣṇaconscious men who has got real brain. Intelligent class of men. So other classes of men who are acting under influence of passion and ignorance, they should take direction from us. And for our directing business, we don't charge anything. And if they follow our direction, they have no loss."
Bhagavān,It can be tested.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Therefore this movement is the most important movement. For giving direction, we don't charge, and by following our direction, they don't lose anything. So why not make an experiment and see the result? The result is already there. Any intelligent man can see. It is not bluff."
Bhagavān,"We are living, sixty, seventy people in this house, cooperatively, like this. That is a very great thing.",Prabhupāda,"And they are living very happily. You can see from their face. Yes. They are known as bright-faced. Yes. Many, I mean, Christian priests, they came to congratulate me: ""Swamiji, how you have made your disciples so jolly and bright-faced?"" The government in America, they are surprised, that even after spending millions of dollars, they could not drive away LSD intoxication. And as soon as a intoxicated person comes to our camp, he not only gives up LSD and liquor, he gives up even smoking, drinking tea and coffee. So why not experiment this movement. The greatest socialist movement. If you want to get the socialistic idea, we can give you. Would you like to take?"
Reporter:,"Reporter:Oh, I don't trust. I could trust. Yeah. But...",Prabhupāda,"Our socialistic idea, you can note down..."
Reporter:,"Reporter:I have nothing to lose but do you think you could manage all society very complex, as our...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Reporter:,Reporter:It's more than...,Prabhupāda,"We can, we can make the society perfect if they take our advice. Because we are working as the brain."
Reporter:,"Reporter:Just a last question. Just... You were saying, minute before that the socialism, your socialism is thatKṛṣṇais your Marx, sort of.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Reporter:,"Reporter:Yeah. But... It will be my last question. What about you in that? Would you be, you are a spiritual chief. Would you be...?",Prabhupāda,I am not spiritual chief.Kṛṣṇais spiritual chief.
Reporter:,Reporter:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. I am simply explaining whatKṛṣṇasays in theBhagavad-gītā.I am acting on His behalf. I am acting on His behalf. Just likeKṛṣṇasays that there is no more higher authority than Him. I am speaking to my students: ""There is no more higher authority thanKṛṣṇa."" So, in other words, there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's statement and my statement."
Yogeśvara,You need the strength to change society.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Yogeśvara,You have to have sufficient strength to change society.,Prabhupāda,"I may not have sufficient strength. I can... If I can convert a dozen of people, that is my success."
Reporter:,"Reporter:I think, I think...",Prabhupāda,"And if you want to know our socialistic idea, I can give you."
Yogeśvara,He never thought that our program was quite so detailed.,Prabhupāda,It is most scientific program.
Bhagavān,We have also economic position.,Prabhupāda,"Everything, I have explained. Now our socialist idea is: God is the father of all living beings. And whatever there is on the surface of the globe, on the sea, on the sky, everything belongs to God. And all the sons of God has equal right to enjoy it. But nobody... (aside:) He is finished? But nobody is allowed to take more than he requires. If one takes more than he requires, he's to be punished. This is our socialist idea. As we think all living entities sons of God, therefore even a lizard in my room should not starve."
Bhagavān,He should not starve is the point.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bhagavān,He should not be allowed to go hungry.,Prabhupāda,"Even a snake is there, he should not also starve. He must have food. We do not support such rascal philosophy that you give food to the man, and send the animals to the slaughterhouse. We do not support this rascaldom, our philosophy is: as human being has got the right to take share of God's property and live, similarly all other living entities, they have got right."
Yogeśvara,Do we have a viewpoint on contraception?,Prabhupāda,"That is most sinful activity. Because a child is coming to live at the expense of God's property, and the rascal father is thinking of overpopulation."
Yogeśvara,"But he says but this is a fact, this overpopulation.",Prabhupāda,"That is another wrong impression. Foolish impression. The whole world has got sufficient place to produce food for ten times the population as it is now. The Americans, they throw grains in the water. So if they send the excess grain to the place where grain is not sufficient, then it is God conscious-ness. If the so-called overpopulation is spread all over the world, there is sufficient place in Africa, Australia, America. The overpopulation can grow their food in these vast uncultivated land."
Yogeśvara,He says that only resolves the problem for a few years.,Prabhupāda,That is nonsense. We don't believe it. That is not...
Yogeśvara,Why. Why is it that this program...?,Prabhupāda,Why do they think that it is for few years?
Yogeśvara,He's thinking that the Earth is not capable of providing enough...,Prabhupāda,"What does he know about Earth? His knowledge is not sufficient. He, he's speaking like a woman who saw in the marketplace in the morning thousands of people have gathered, and she began to cry: ""Where I shall give place to these men?"" So her son came: ""My dear mother, don't cry. You come in the evening. We shall find some solution."" So when she came in the evening, there was nobody."
Yogeśvara,You can translate that story? (French) (to Prabhupāda:) She went there to buy her foodstuffs?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Yogeśvara,(French),Prabhupāda,"So you are thinking in that way. ""How I shall provide this population?"" That is the old woman's crying. Without sufficient knowledge. We do not believe in this, all rascaldom. We believe in God. If God can create... just like animals. They do not cry. They're increasing. The hogs and dogs, even lower animals... This is demonic economy. A man is holding thousands of acres of land and he's thinking of overpopulation. Why not he distributes the thousands of acres of land to the people? They would produce their own food. That is the, that is the defect of so-called socialism. But here we give a right type of socialism."
Yogeśvara,He thinks he has a fairly clear idea of what our program is now.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Reporter:,Reporter:Thank you very much for this (indistinct).,Prabhupāda,Thank you.
Bhagavān,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is Dr. Inger.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Come. Come on.
Yogeśvara,Give him someprasādambefore he leaves.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Take littleprasādam.
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:I was hoping, many years since I went to London to theHareKrishna center there...,",Prabhupāda,"Oh, you have been in our temple?"
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Many times, yes. And I had followed the booklets that came,Back to Godhead,also read. I didn't get, I didn't have a copy of theBhāgavatam,but I read your translations...",Prabhupāda,You are Indian?

Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:Oh yes. Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So one Bengali gentleman, he was Mr.Mitha, they were physician. So I became his guest. They were very well-to-do men. They were living therefore two, three generations. Mithi family."

Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:Perhaps...,Prabhupāda,I forget the name.
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Yes, there were quite a number of Bengalis there.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes, yes."
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:Long time ago.,Prabhupāda,"Long time ago. I went there in 1925. I was going to Kashmir. On my way I stopped in Lahore, Amritsar, and some other places."
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Yes, and yes, and then, you came first to Europe about six years ago?",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Yes, yes. Of course. And...",Prabhupāda,You have seen all our books?
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:No, no. I have only seen a few in London.",Prabhupāda,Why don't you show our books. Show him?
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:I haven't seen the new ones. I have seen the...,Prabhupāda,Bring all the books.
Devotee:,Devotee:ŚrīmadBhāgavatam?[break],Prabhupāda,These books have been produced within six years.
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:Really!,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Fantastic. I do not know how. So much work, incredible!",Prabhupāda,"I work at night, writing books. My work is going on. At night, I write. [break] In the UNESCO, to understand God or spiritual life, they do not think it a necessary?"
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Well, that's a very, very important question. I think that the real trouble is that all of them are bureaucrats, sitting in offices, creating more jobs for other officers. I was one of the earliest members. I came when Dr. Radhakrishnan was the, was our president. And... At the very early stage. In those days, there was that feeling, that some importance should be given, but because it became a governmental organization, because every religion thinks that they should have a part to play in it, what they did was, they brought out, in ten volumes, a scientific and cultural history of mankind. But it has, it's only incidentally philosophy, only incidentally religion. The only religious books that have come out are those that have been translated. Old books like the second book to the East, for instance. Max Muller's books. And they have been reprinted. And occasionally a few translations have been done from Tulasidāsa or some other philosophers, rewritten, like Śaṅkara later on. But, but all of those have been done because somebody else has commissioned them. But otherwise, there isn't... Except they have had some meetings in various placed. But at none of these meetings do they really discuss the problem that of the, well occasional people, occasional philosophers, they never really discuss that. I think because the word, religion, I think probably is the stumbling block...",Prabhupāda,"No, apart from religion. Religion may be sentiment or some emotion. That is another thing."
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"But we can ask what is this cosmic manifestation, what is the purpose of this, who created, how it is created. Are they not scientific?"
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Yes. Now this is another problem. Everything of a philosophical kind, they call it science, human sciences, natural sciences, moral sciences. They think that is a fault(?) to satisfy scientific spirit. I think from that point of view, they allow big conferences to be held where a particular theme is taken, different people come. So the organization encourages, stimulates activities proposed, submitted and finally passed in resolutions by different commissions and different countries. And then it's held. And at that particular time, some people come and speak. So they have had... But they haven't... Mostly these meetings have been held and... Very few have been held here, except when they celebrated the tintinary(?) of Aurobindo, last year. Or when they celebrated the centenary of, another centenary of Ramakrishna. Like that. But not always.",Prabhupāda,NotKṛṣṇa.
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:They haven't. Not so far. Because from their point of view they have to prove the dates, historical dates, how many centuries, and so forth.",Prabhupāda,It is there in theśāstras.
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:I know. But so... If one can put it that way, then somebody has to submit that we are going to celebrate the three thousand anniversary, or four thousand anniversary, and... But no such step has been taken. But such an idea can be proposed.",Prabhupāda,"No, suppose the United Nations is the organization of the whole human society, so if I ask the United Nations, as an organization that: ""What is the purpose of this cosmic manifestation?"" That is a fact. There is a cosmic manifestation. The scientists, they are also trying to understand. So there are so many scientists, philosophers, what is their answer? Suppose I am inquisitive to know something. So where shall I inquire? A sectarian question."
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:No, no, no. It won't be.",Prabhupāda,"It is... Why it should be presented toPārtha-sārathi.Even American representative or English representative or French representative, any representative can do..."
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Because being a governmental organization, the only kind of reply one would get from such a question would be a very polite and courteous one, but it wouldn't have... No action would be taken. Action can only be taken, if it is governmentally presented. That is the only problem. There are many ideas which come forward, boundless ones, but the people need to present them officially. And... [break]",Prabhupāda,...your position there?
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Well, now I am a consultant. I used to be a regular member of the staff for a long time. Now I do certain projects for them, and I'm a visiting professor, and I'm a writer, visiting professor at different universities. So I'm connected with, with UNESCO in a way that I can not be now a permanent member of the staff which I was... [break]",Prabhupāda,"...purpose is not to propose only. Because I wish that there are so many scient..., scientific men, philosophers and thoughtful men... Suppose even if I ask you, what is your answer, that what is the purpose...? The cosmic manifestation is there, the universe is there, and there are innumerable planets within this universe, and they are very organizely kept. Everything is nicely going on. The sun is rising in due time. The moon is rising in due time. The seasons, seasons are changing. There is nice organization. So is it not a bona fide inquiry to, ""What is the purpose of this organization?"""
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Well, the purpose is to understand oneself in relation to the cosmos.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:And therefore everything else is valueless if it has no relation to the total.,Prabhupāda,"No, relation is already there because, as the sun is part of this cosmos, I'm also one of the parts. So why the sun is made and why I am also made? What is this purpose? That is my question."
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:There's a discovery of...,Prabhupāda,Yes. The relation is already there.
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:The discoveries...,Prabhupāda,"Because I am part of this creation. Now why I am created a man, another is created an elephant, another is createdBrahmā, another is created ant, another is created...? So many. Why this is?"
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:The purpose of life?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. I, I, I, I don't think anyone has thought over this matter."
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:It certainly needs to be...,Prabhupāda,"But there is. There are so many philosophers, scientists... Why do they not try to think of it? What is this purpose?"
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Well, some have tried to talk about the purpose of existence that we are little entities of no significance. Some... Because...",Prabhupāda,"No. My question is why you have become a little entity, another has become big entity?"
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:karma.,Prabhupāda,"So. Yes,karma..."
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:Exactly. What we have gone through. We are the, we are the result of our past actions.",Prabhupāda,Yes. That is a fact. That is a fact. Because we get all this information from Vedic literature.Karmaṇādaivanetreṇa[SB3.31.1].You understand Sanskrit?
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:Little bit.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Karmaṇādaivanetreṇajantordehaupapattaye.A living entity is getting body by, as a result of hiskarma.And supervised by higher authority. Now when we speak ofkarma,or result ofkarma,there must be somebody who will judge. Just like one has stolen something, and the magistrate is judging thekarma,the criminal activity, and he's putting him either in the prison house or getting him released. ""No, he's not culprit."" So as soon as we speak ofkarma,there must be somebody else to judge. And that judgement is said:daivanetreṇa.Daivameans divine supervision. So what is that divine supervision? Next question immediately comes. As soon as you acceptkarma, and the resultant action, and it is supervised by the divine authority, then next question will be: what is that divine authority? In this way, we have to go forward. So that sort of education is nowhere in the world."
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:No. Not here, in any case.",Prabhupāda,"No, here, or India, or everywhere."
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:Yes. Nobody is...,Prabhupāda,So that means people have become so dull in spite of so-called education.
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:That is true.,Prabhupāda,"That's, that's my point."
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:Oh yes. Education is merely book knowledge.,Prabhupāda,Mūḍhā.
Dr. Inger:,"Dr. Inger:...of substance given, read, prepared.",Prabhupāda,That's all.
Dr. Inger:,Dr. Inger:They don't go to the basic.,Prabhupāda,Śramaevahikevalam.That is described in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamas simply wasting time. That's all.
