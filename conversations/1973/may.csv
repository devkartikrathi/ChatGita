Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:When I drove, so the stars were very shining in the sky very clear. [break]",Prabhupāda,Man-made rubbish. Although they have got machine. [break] What other things they can produce there?
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:From sand?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:There is a compound that is called silicon carbide. That is, I think, it is very hard, as hard as diamond They make silicon carbide. I'm not sure but silicon carbide or tungsten carbide. They are used for cutting diamond. They are harder than diamond. Very strong, very hard. They combine this with carbon. It requires tremendous amounts of force to do this, high temperature, high pressure. (pause)",Prabhupāda,Anything eatables?
Brahmānanda,Future.,Prabhupāda,"""In future."" But God creates so many eatables from sand. Do you know?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:The smaller birds, they are eating something from sand?",Prabhupāda,"No, even for man. The cantaloupe, watermelon, they are produced in sand in large quantity.Kharmuja.(Bengali)"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:Lemons also.,Prabhupāda,"Not lemon. Watermelon. These are the products of the desert, as well as dates. Just like these date trees can grow in sand. (pause)"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday'sBhāgavatalecture, the example that the hundred dollar bill, one hundred dollar bill. So if somebody picks up and takes it, he's a thief, and if somebody who just does not care...",Prabhupāda,Does not take it.
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, he's also not good. And the one who takes up and says, ""Whose coin is this?"" Then he's good.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, his service is better."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, but how about the one who picks up and he doesn't find the owner of the coins but he offers toKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda,"No, he must find out. Because there are so many men, some of them must have lost that. So so far Kṛṣṇa's property is concerned, everyone knows, ""This is Kṛṣṇa's property."" There is no need of finding out.Īśāvāsyamidaṁsarvam[Īśomantra1].Just like everyone knows, ""This is American state."" Where is the difficulty to find out? That was an example, but so far things are concerned, we know that, as we know that this land belongs to the American state, similarly this is false. Actually, everything belongs to God. There is no difficulty to understand. You have not created this ocean. You have not created this land. You have created nothing. You are simply stealing. That is your business. So how you do not know that it belongs to God? Everyone should know. This is knowledge. If I create something, I must enjoy it. Rather, the Vedic injunction is that you do not enjoy anything which you cannot create. You do not enjoy anything which you cannot create."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:So we cannot create anything so...,Prabhupāda,"Therefore you cannot enjoy anything. You have to accept everything asprasādam.First of all you take sanction from the proprietor. Then you he will give... That is your business. Just like if I want to use this land, I have to take permission from the government, that ""I want this land. Give me permission."" So when government gives you permission you can use. Otherwise you will be criminal. You cannot say, ""Oh, there are so much land, let me encircle it with my fence and I live there."" No. Immediately criminal. You cannot do anything as you like with this ocean. Can you do? No you have to take permission from the government. Just like the fishing boats, they have got government permission. Otherwise they cannot. Therefore in theĪśopaniṣadit is said,tenatyaktenabhuñjīthāḥ[Īśomantra1].Tenatyaktena.""When it is sanctioned, when it is given to you, then you enjoy.""Māgṛdhaḥkasyasviddhanam.""Do not touch anyone's property."" This is Vedic injunction. So if everything belongs to God, how you can touch it without His permission? But they are rascals. They do not know who is God, where is God, how to take permission. They do not know. Therefore they become criminals. They are suffering. Encroaching upon God's property and therefore they are suffering. All these things are stated in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Everything belongs to God, and because we are sons of God, we can use the father's property. But not more than what I require. Just like in a family everything is father's property, and if you eat more, all the good things in the family, that is not allowed. You must take what the mother or the father gives you. That is your business. Similarly everything is God's property. Everyone, even the birds, beasts, everyone has right to use the father's property. Just like the birds. They will use. Just like they are picking up the small fishes. So as much they require, they are allowed, ""Take it."" But they are not making any stock for speculation. Man does that. As soon as there is some good harvest, ah, immediately they... [break]... problem. If everyone only takes as much he requires, there is no problem in the world. But he wants to take more. Just like you Americans, you have covered so many thousands of miles. And you don't allow anyone. ""No, you cannot enter. Here is gun."" What is this nonsense? It is God's property. Why do you disallow others. Let them come. So there is no question of over-population. There are so much land in Australia, in Africa, here in America, that ten times of the present population can be provided. God has provided. But these rascals will not allow. So there is overpopulation in India, in China and other places, and there is problem. They are trying to occupy more land but you will not allow. Therefore war, there is war. So we create problems. Otherwise God has supplied us enough. You can use it; as much as you like you can use what you have... They are creating trouble and the scientists giving them, ""Yes, I am giving you this chemical composition. You drop on the enemies' camp."" This is scientific research, to impel the rascals. (laughter) The rascals, rogues, they are trying to usurp other's property, and the scientists helping them. That's all. If you help one murderer, if you help one thief, then you also become criminal. Is it not? So they are helping one another, all these thieves and rogues. Therefore there is so much trouble in the world. They are all criminals.Stenaevasaucyate[Bg.3.12].One who does not recognize the proprietorship of the Lord, he is a thief. Find out, take statistics how many people recognizes God. Take statistic. Everyone will say, ""Eh! What is God, nonsense."" Everyone will say. Therefore they are in trouble. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura summarizes this fact:māyār bośe, jāccho bhese, Khāccho hābuḍububhāi, jīvkṛṣṇa-dās, e biśwās, korle to ār duḥkhonāi.As soon as you believe in God and accept yourself as eternal servant, there is no more problem. Everything is there. But they are being carried away by the illusory energy. Therefore they are under the control of time and nature.māyār bośe, jāccho...Just like these seaweeds are carried by the waves, ""Get out,"" similarly, one who is not accepted... There are other seaweeds, they are not thrown away, but these sea weeds, because little outside—thrown away. There are millions and millions of fishes, they are not thrown away, because they have surrendered to the sea, under the protection of the sea. The sea is protecting them. Just see. Similarly you surrender, you will be protected.Kṛṣṇasays that.Ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmimāśucaḥ:[Bg.18.66] Don't be worried. I will give you protection. You surrender unto Me."" And the scientists say, ""Oh, what is God. These are all nonsense, primitive ideas. Primitive."" They have become advanced. Therefore they should give up the idea of God. Now India is declared famine. What these leaders will do?"
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They are fighting each other.,Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇais asking you that ""You realize Me."" ""No, I cannot see You."" ""No, why cannot see you? Here is water. You are drinking water."" ""Yes."" ""I am water, I am the taste of the water. Why don't you see Me?""Prabhāsmiśaśi-sūryayoḥ:""I am the sunshine."" So who is not seeing the sunshine? Why the rascals says, ""I do not see God""? God says, ""I am here."" But he says, ""I do not see."" Liar. If you are in my front, if I say, ""Here I am,"" if you say, ""No, sir, I don't see you,"" what is this? Similarly, God is before you in the form of sunshine. Don't you see the sunshine? Why do you say that I do not see God? Who has not seen the sunshine? In the morning, very early in the morning, you see God. That isGāyatrīmantra.Oṁbhūrbhuvaḥsvaḥtatsaviturvareṇyaṁbhargodevasya.That is the obeisances to the sun.Savitṛ. Savitṛmeans,savitāmeans sun. In the very beginning we see God by the sunshine, and then think of the sunshine, how much potential it is, how everything is being produced by the sunshine. As soon as there is no sunshine, we become disturbed, so many business become disturbed. So why don't you understand that without God's presence, we cannot do anything. Where is the difficulty? Does it require any very big philosophical speculation? The rascal will not admit as directed in the Vedic literature. That is their fault. Otherwise where is the difficulty? No difficulty. What is the explanation of these scientists of the sunshine?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:They say the sunshine is just some... Sun is a... There is a gaseous material, very hot temperature. So the rays are coming from the sun...",Prabhupāda,"That's all right, but it can kill you. Is it not? So when did you accept with God? Sunshine, if it increases a little temperature, millions of you will be killed immediately. So why don't you accept sun as God? Therefore, according to Vedic principles, sun in the beginning is accepted as God."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:They take it as a material object.,Prabhupāda,"Then accept you are under its control. God means controller.Īśvara. Īśvarameans controller. God means controller. So He is controlling you. It is material but it is not under your control. You are under its control. So if anything is controlling you, that is God. God means controller. If you cannot seeKṛṣṇa, you can see the sun."
Svarūpa,SvarūpaDāmodara:The sun is a product ofKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, energy.Yac cakṣureṣasavitāsakalagrahāṇām.Sun is working under the order of... Just like if you don't see the managing director or the proprietor of a firm, the immediate boss who is controlling you, you have to obey. In the office or in the factory. Similarly, you cannot see directly God, but God's agent is working. Why don't you obey? God's agent is working? How it is working?Yasyāj&#241ayābhramatisaṁbhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ,exactly in time by the order ofKṛṣṇa, rising exactly in the time, without any deviation even by 1/10,000th part of a second, astrological calculation. Is it not? So how it is working? Under whose order it is working?Śāstrasays, ""By the order ofKṛṣṇa.""Yasyaāj&#241ay&#257;</a>.</span> ""Under whose order he is working,"" <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/govindam"" class=""d"">govindam</a> <a href=""/d/adi"" class=""d"">&#257;di</a>-<a href=""/d/purusam"" class=""d"">puru&#7779;am</a>,</span> ""I worship that <a href=""/d/govinda"" class=""d"">Govinda</a>."" The <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a></span> is giving you information, that he is working under, he must be working under... Otherwise why it is so accurate, so punctual, unless there is some direction? Unless there is order of God, why this big ocean is so obedient, it is not coming here? Why don't you study like this? Where is the difficulty? There must be some direction that ""You Pacific Ocean, you are so big, that's all right, but you cannot come here. Remain up to this."" Otherwise why you are feeling so safety although in the front of a big ocean. If the ocean likes, within a second, he can finish us immediately. But she will not do, because there is order. Similarly sun. Sun is also moving under the order. You have to study like that. If you do not see God, see how God's order is being carried out. Then you will understand. Just like we do not see President Nixon. But you know there is direction, and the government is going is going on under his direction. That we can know. This is seeing of God to see how things are going on under His order. That is seeing of God. Just like from long distant place like this hills, we are seeing, but at the same time not seeing distinctly. You are seeing those, but you do not see the detail. Similarly you are seeing God by these things, but because you are not so powerful, you are not seeing Him in detail. But you are seeing God. You cannot say that ""I don't see God."" How can you say? These are the directions. You are seeing that things are going on under direction. <span class=""Italic"">Yasy&#257;j&#241ay&#257;.</span> Therefore you have to... <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a> yonitv&#257;t.</span> The <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/vedanta"" class=""d"">Ved&#257;nta</a></span> says, ""You have to understand God through <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a>;""</span> by the scriptures you have to understand. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a> yonitv&#257;t.</span> Everything is there.

But where there is feeling, that is spiritual, and where there is no feeling, that is matter. What is <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness? The human being is the same. But as soon as he feels that ""There is <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>,"" he is spiritualist. As soon as he does not feel, he is materialist. That is the difference. It is the question of feeling. Matter means where there is absence of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. In other things there is also consciousness. Because there is not <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, it is material. And so far we are concerned, we have got the same consciousness, but <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. Therefore we are superior, spiritual. So this material world means this part, and spiritual world means this part. This is the difference. Here you have got feeling. So the conclusion is when you have feeling in <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, that is spiritual, that is superior. When you have no feeling of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, that is inferior. The same thing can be turned into superior and inferior by the change of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness.</div>

So the energy or the energetic&mdash;non-different. But by His arrangement, one is working as superior, one is working as inferior. The same example, that the same electric energy is acting as cooler and acting as heater. But the energy is the same. Similarly, originally the energy is God's energy. So God's energy and God, there is no difference. But by his manipulation one is working as material energy, another is working... This is difference. Therefore originally it comes all spiritual energy, life. Therefore we have to take everything from life, not from the dead. Same example: The finger is first coming, life, and then the nail is coming, matter. Not that first of all nail is coming. You can study. This is meditation.</div>

And then dwindling, then finished. This is matter. But life has no such change. When the life is within the matter, it appears that it is taking birth or death. Life will come. One phase of this change, accept. And when it cannot be maintained anymore, just like this body, when it is too old it cannot maintain. Just like dress. When it is too old we change. So these things are there. The matter is... Life is existing. Life has no change. The change is outward, material thing. In all respects we have to prove that life does not come from matter.

Why you create the cause of cancer disease? You accept these four principles of life&mdash;no meat-eating, no intoxication, no illicit sex&mdash;there will be no cancer. There will be no cancer. You find out, those who are strictly on this line, they never suffer from cancer or any disease. Now take for example, me. I have come here in this country for the last seven years, 1965, and it is 1973, eight years. How many times I have gone to doctor? That once that heart attack. That is serious; that is another thing. Otherwise generally how many times I have gone to? I don't pay any bill of doctors.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> That you can do. That is, I can do also. It is not very great credit. But if you know how it is formed, then counteract it.</div>

<A NAME=""355748""></A><div id=""355748""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. So you know, then you discover, counteracting. Just like formerly, in the warfare the atomic <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmastra"" class=""d"">brahm&#257;stra</a></span> was thrown. On the other side... <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmastra"" class=""d"">brahm&#257;stra</a></span> means excessive heat. So they caused something, they transformed into water. Because after heat, there must be water. So where is that science?</div>

Milk looks white, but it is just water. They call it, it's a colloidal suspension of proteins, these caseins, in water. So similarly, this fog is just a colloidal suspension of water in the air.</div>
<A NAME=""355750""></A><div id=""355750""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. So you create some fire. It will be immediately driven away. Water can be driven away by fire. So you create. That you cannot. You just shot one bomb. There will be some heat, and all the mist will go away. Do it.</div>
<A NAME=""355751""></A><div id=""355751""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Karandhara:</span> That would blow up the planet. (laughter)</div>

Water can be counteracted by fire or air. Everyone knows it. So you do it, suspension. So this is for you mystic power. You can talk all nonsense, but you cannot act against it. Therefore it is mystic power. So similarly, there are so many things. That is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/acintya"" class=""d"">acintya</a>-<a href=""/d/sakti"" class=""d"">&#347;akti</a>.</span> You cannot think of even. By nature's way, immediately the sun rises&mdash;no more mist. All finished. A little temperature increase of the sun, all finished. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/niharam"" class=""d"">N&#299;h&#257;ram</a> <a href=""/d/iva"" class=""d"">iva</a> <a href=""/d/bhaskarah"" class=""d"">bh&#257;skara&#7717;</a>.</span> This example is given in the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/bhagavata"" class=""d"">Bh&#257;gavata</a>.</span> <span class=""Italic"">N&#299;h&#257;ra,</span> this is called <span class=""Italic"">n&#299;h&#257;ra.</span> Just like <span class=""Italic"">n&#299;h&#257;ra</span> is immediately dissipated by <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/bhaskara"" class=""d"">bh&#257;skara</a>,</span> by the sun, similarly, if one can awaken his dormant devotion, then all finished, all his reaction of sinful activities, finished. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/niharam"" class=""d"">N&#299;h&#257;ram</a> <a href=""/d/iva"" class=""d"">iva</a> <a href=""/d/bhaskarah"" class=""d"">bh&#257;skara&#7717;</a>.</span> You just create...

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold""><a href=""/d/svarupa"" class=""d"">Svar&#363;pa</a> <a href=""/d/damodara"" class=""d"">D&#257;modara</a>:</span> That is what the research means. Research means to understand what was not known before.</div>
<A NAME=""355754""></A><div id=""355754""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. Research means you admit that you are all fools and rascals. Research meant for whom? Who does not know. Otherwise where is the question of research? You do not know. You admit that. So so many mystic powers are there. You do not know how it is being done. Therefore you have to accept inconceivable power. And without accepting this principle of inconceivable power, there is no meaning of God. Not like that <a href=""/d/bala"" class=""d"">Bala</a>-<a href=""/d/yogi"" class=""d"">yog&#299;</a> became a God. So these are for the rascals, fools. But those who are intelligent, they will stress the inconceivable power. Just like we accept <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as God&mdash;inconceivable power. We accept <a href=""/d/rama"" class=""d"">R&#257;ma</a>&mdash;inconceivable power. Not so cheaply. One rascal comes and says, ""I am incarnation of God."" Another rascal accepts. It is not like that. ""Ramakrishna is God."" We do not accept. We must see the inconceivable mystic power. Just like <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, as a child, lifted a hill. This is inconceivable mystic power. <a href=""/d/ramacandra"" class=""d"">R&#257;macandra</a>, He constructed a bridge of stone without pillar. The stone began to float: ""Come on."" So that is an inconceivable power. And because you cannot adjust this inconceivable power, when they are described, you say, ""Oh, these are all stories."" What is called? Mythology. But these great, great sages, V&#257;lm&#299;ki and Vy&#257;sadeva and other <span class=""Italic"">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> they simply wasted their time in writing mythology? Such learned scholars? And they have not interpreted that it is mythology. They have accepted it as actual fact. There was forest fire. All the friends and cowherd boys, they became disturbed. They began to see towards <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>: ""K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, what to do?"" ""All right."" He simply swallowed up the whole fire. This is inconceivable mystic power. That is God. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/aisvarya"" class=""d"">Ai&#347;varya</a>-<a href=""/d/vairagya"" class=""d"">vair&#257;gya</a>-ya&#347;o-'vabhodha-<a href=""/d/virya"" class=""d"">v&#299;rya</a>-<a href=""/d/sriya"" class=""d"">&#347;riy&#257;</a>.</span> These six opulences in full. That is God. That inconceivable power, inconceivable energy or mystic power, we have got also. Very minute quantity. So many things are going on within our body. We cannot explain. The same example. My nails are coming exactly in the form. Although it is spoiled by disease, again it is coming. I do not know what machinery is going on, and the nail is coming, exactly fitting the position and everything. That is coming from my body. So that is mystic power. Even it is mystic power for me and to the doctors, everyone... They cannot explain.</div>

<A NAME=""355756""></A><div id=""355756""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. Yes. But they are rascal. It is not the brain that is working. It is the spirit soul that is working. The same thing: the computer machine. The rascal will think that a computer machine is working. No. The man is working. He pushes the button, then it works. Otherwise, what is the value of this machine? You keep the machine for thousands of years, it will not work. When another man will come, put the button, then it will work. So who is working? The machine is working or the man is working? And the man is also another machine. And it is working due to the presence of <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/paramatma"" class=""d"">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>,</span> God. Therefore, ultimately, God is working. A dead man cannot work. So how long a man remains living? So long the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/paramatma"" class=""d"">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a></span> is there, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/atma"" class=""d"">&#257;tm&#257;</a></span> is there. Even the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/atma"" class=""d"">&#257;tm&#257;</a></span> is there, if <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/paramatma"" class=""d"">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a></span> does not give him intelligence, he cannot work. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mattah"" class=""d"">Matta&#7717;</a> sm&#7771;tir <a href=""/d/jnanam"" class=""d"">j&#241&#257;nam</a> <a href=""/d/apohanam"" class=""d"">apohana&#7745;</a> <a href=""/d/ca"" class=""d"">ca</a></span></I> [Bg. </I><a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1"">15.15</a></I>]<span class=""Italic""></I>.</span> God is giving me intelligence, ""You put this button."" Then I put this button. So ultimately <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is working. Another, untrained man cannot come and work on it because there is no intelligence. And a particular man who is trained up, he can work. So these things are going on. Ultimately comes to <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. What you are researching, what you are talking, that is also <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is doing. <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is giving you in... You, you prayed for this facility to <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is giving you.

So when <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> sees that you are so much harassed in experimental, ""All right do it."" Just like <a href=""/d/yasoda"" class=""d"">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> <a href=""/d/ma"" class=""d"">M&#257;</a> was trying to tie <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but she could not do. But when <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> agreed, it was possible. Similarly, this accident means <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> helps you: ""All right, you have worked so hard, take this result."" Everything is <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mattah"" class=""d"">Matta&#7717;</a> sm&#7771;tir <a href=""/d/jnanam"" class=""d"">j&#241&#257;nam</a> <a href=""/d/apohanam"" class=""d"">apohana&#7745;</a> <a href=""/d/ca"" class=""d"">ca</a></span></I> [Bg. </I><a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1"">15.15</a></I>]<span class=""Italic""></I>.</span> Everything is coming from <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>.</div>
