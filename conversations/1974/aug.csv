Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, they... There has to be...",Prabhupāda,"They do not know. The scientists, they do not know what is the necessity. (laughs) Do they know? Do you think, all the scientists, do they know?"
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:If they know, they'll be allbhaktas.",Prabhupāda,They do not know.
Devotee:,Devotee:They think it is necessary to gratify the senses.,Prabhupāda,"They think that, that by gratifying senses... Therefore they are having the same sex at home, again going to the naked dance. They think, ""This thing will be able to give me happiness."" But that is not giving, actually. Then they becomemad."
Brahmānanda,Chewing the chewed.,Prabhupāda,"Chewing the chewed, that's all.Punaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30].They do not know. That is the mistake of the whole civilization. They do not know what is the necessity. They are manufacturing,durāśayābahir-artha-māninaḥ.By adjustment of this external energy they are trying. You'll see the whole world, especially in the western world, they do not know what is the necessity. Here at least there areśāstras,there are gurus, people at least taking, still, although it is dead now. But in the western world they do not know at all. Their only happiness is this sex.Yanmaithunādi-gṛhamedhisukhaṁhitucchamkaṇḍūyanenakarayorivaduḥkha-duḥkham[SB7.9.45].Itching. Itching sensation. More and more itching and the itches are increasing.Kaṇḍūyanena...They examples are given very nice.Kaṇḍūyanenakarayorivaduḥkha-duḥkham.Karayoḥmeans hands. There is itching sensation, like this, like this, like this. And the itching disease is increasing. So therefore it is advised thattṛpyantinehakṛpanābahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.By itching, by satisfying the senses, itching sensation, then troubles and miserable condition increasing. That they do not know. Increasing.Tṛpyantinehakṛpanābahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.Bahumeans much,duḥkhameans miserable condition. Therefore one who is sensible:kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁviṣahetadhīraḥ.Thedhīra,one (who) is sober, he understands, ""What I am doing? I am simply trying to eat and the disease is increasing. Therefore it must be stopped."" This is calleddhīra.That is calleddhīra.That is, one word is used,dhīra,inKumāra-sambhava.ThatPārvatīwas induced. Lord Śiva was in meditation, and the necessity was that Kārttikeya... Kārttikeya means, ""With the semina of Lord Śiva and Pārvatī's, what is called? Semen, they mix together, the child will be born. He can kill these demons."" Therefore Kārttik... So Lord Śiva was engaged in meditation. SoPārvatīwas engaged to worship the genital of Lord Śiva. That... Therefore they introduced this,Śiva-liṅgais worshiped.Śiva-liṅga.So when she was worshiping, a young girl touching the genital, but he was sitting without any disturbance. Therefore he has been described,dhīra.Dhīra.One who is not disturbed by the sex impulse even in the presence of very beautiful young girl, he is calleddhīra.Sokaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁviṣahetadhīraḥ.One has to becomedhīra.That is wanted. Just likeHaridāsa, Ṭhākura. Twice he was induced by very beautiful young girl at dead of night. But he remained... ""Yes, I'll satisfy you."" He turned... That is calleddhīra.There is another place. Thedhīraword is used in theBhagavad-gītā."
Brahmānanda,Even by death he is not disturbed.,Prabhupāda,"Not disturbed. So one has to becomedhīra.Then he'll be satisfied. Then he'll be satisfied. Then... That is theprayojana-siddhi,to finish this business, material business, and completely prepare for going back to home, back to Godhead. ThereforeCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas very strict. He therefore advised,niṣki&#241canasyabhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya. Bhagavad-bhajan,devotional service of the Lord meansparaṁparaṁ jigamiṣorbhava-sāgarasya.Going to the other side of this material ocean. So one who is serious about going to the other side of this ocean, for him, two things are very dangerous.Viṣayināṁsandarśanamathayoṣitāmcahāhantahāhantaviṣa-bhakṣaṇato 'pyasādhu[Cc.Madhya11.8].It is dangerous, it is most heinous activities than drinking poison. What are these?Viṣayināṁsandarśanam,to mix with the... Or... Mix very intimately with the materialistic person and to have association with woman with sense purpose.Yoṣitām.To see woman is not bad, but as soon as one sees woman with a sensual purpose, that is very condemned. That is condemned. So unless one becomesdhīra,he cannot do that. So we have to finish this business of material sensuous engagement and becomedhīra.Then we are fit candidate for going back to home, back to Godhead."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:That, thatdhīracannot be attained artificially. (?)",Prabhupāda,"No, that is not possible.Paraṁdṛṣṭvānivartate[Bg. 9.59].Unless you find something better than the sex life, you cannot bedhīra.Therefore Kṛṣṇa's name isMadana-Mohana.Madanameans Cupid. Cupid is enchanting everyone. Everyone is enchanted by Cupid.Madana-dahan(?). AndKṛṣṇaisMadana-Mohana, He enchants Cupid. And Rādhārāṇī isMadana-mohana-mohinī, (S)he enchantsKṛṣṇa.Madana-Mohana-mohinī."
Brahmānanda,One is Madan-madan?,Prabhupāda,"One isMadana, andKṛṣṇaenchantsMadana.Kṛṣṇais so beautiful thatMadanabecomes enchanted byKṛṣṇa. And Rādhārāṇī is so beautiful thatKṛṣṇabecomes enchanted. That is spiritual sex. That is not ordinary. Therefore the attraction ofRādhāandKṛṣṇais not ordinary thing.Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtirhlādinī-śaktir,this is the spiritual energy, display of spiritual energy. But thesahajiyās,they take as material attractions. As we are attracted, men and women, similarly, they take theRādhāandKṛṣṇaattraction... (end) Guest:(French) Bhagavān:He said for forty-five years now he has not eaten any meat, he has been vegetarian. Oh, you are forty-five percent advanced. Let them come forward. Oh, they are chanting. Very good. Bhagavān:Many young people. You speak Italian. You speak French? English?Habla espanol? Which language? Devotee (1):Italian. Italian. Ah. Bhagavān:TheHareKṛṣṇa, that is universal language everyone understands. You are fromRome? Guest:Yes. Bhagavān:We have a temple there. Guest:Yes, I know. Very good. (aside:) Come on. Bhagavān:Umāpati is nicely editing these books also. Oh. Bhagavān:He is editing the philosophy, making sure everything is exact. You are doing good service. Now you have got good engagement. Umāpati:Everything is very nice here. Stay here. Where is your wife? Umāpati:She went to the farm, so I guess she just hasn't come back yet. Oh, she went to the farm? Umāpati:Yes. Bhagavān:And she is translatingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Oh. Bhagavān:She is helping to translate theBhāgavatam. And Jyotirmayī? Bhagavān:She is doing the distribution ofBhagavad-gītāsin stores, and she is meeting important people. Whatever articles are written about us, she is answering the articles in the paper. Nice service. This Europe is a very good field for making devotees. Oh, yes. Bhagavān:You are Italian also? Woman:No. Bhagavān:From where? Woman:I'm from California. Woman (2): I am (indistinct) sister. Bhagavān:Oh, (indistinct) sister. It is Haihaya's wife's sister. Oh. She is French? No. Bhagavān:No, American. And this boy? Devotee (1):He's from Morocco. Morocco. Bhagavān:They speak French? Devotee (1):Yeah, they all speak French. [break] Bhagavān:...that all over the world there are actually devotees ofKṛṣṇaand that they are just waiting for thesaṅkīrtanaparties to pick them up. Yes.Nitya-siddhakṛṣṇa-bhakti.Kṛṣṇa-bhaktiis there in everywhere. French Devotee:Are you coming back in September? Huh? Bhagavān:The devotees want to know if you're coming back. Yes. Bhagavān:Many people are still talking about that engagement you had in that big hall last year. They're still talking about that engagement. It was very successful. Devotee(1):Many devotees joined afterward. French Devotee:In the street we still see pictures of this. Bhagavān:(to guest) You have read any books of ours? Woman:(indistinct) Devotee (1):Many people are very anxious for the FrenchBhagavad-gītā. We've already received many letters in the mail asking for copies of it. Devotee (2):One advanced order forBhagavad-gītā, eighty copies from a book shop. Here? Devotee (2):In Africa. You can advertise in paper. You will get good orders. Bhagavān:They have said that this Aurobindo copy, this is almost out of print now. Devotee (1):There is no edition ofBhagavad-gītālike your edition ever in France. This is the first time. Aurobindo is hodgepodge. It is simply vocabulary. No concrete contribution. Simply words.Tad-vijñānārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet[MU1.2.12].In order to learn the science, one must go to the bona fideguru. Otherwise it is not possible. In theBhagavad-gītā, find this verse. French Devotee:Chapter Four? Devotee (1):You should read the French. (French devotee reads Sanskrit and French translation) Purport. (devotee reads Purport in French) You come here. Sit facing them. If they have got any question about this? Yogeśvara(translating):He said he would be happy if the spiritual master was speaking French becauseKṛṣṇais only speaking French now. Kṛṣṇaspeaks in all languages, and He speaks so perfectly that everyone thinks that He speaks only in his language. He could speak with the birds even. There is a Sanskrit word,babhudak. This means one who can speak all languages. So it is stated there in theBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,Nectar of Devotion, that on the bank ofYamunāHe was one day talking with a bird. Every living being has got a different language. Yogeśvara(translating):He says but they are a little bit jealous of the Americans who speak English, which is the language that you speak. The America is my fatherland. My motherland is in India, and America is my fatherland. Bhagavān:We are trying to make one country. Devotee (3):Śrīla Prabhupāda, when scientists and astrologers are looking into the heavens, sometimes they see what they say to be flying saucers, different flying objects, lights in the sky. Do we have any explanation for this? Everything is flying, all these planets, they are flying. Devotee (3):Sometimes they are zig-zagging very fast across the sky (indistinct). Maybe there is (indistinct). Why not? Yogeśvara(to guests):This is a wonderful opportunity also if you'd like to ask any questions of Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's a rare opportunity that he's here, you can speak with him.

<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> So the God, He is also with me always as friend. So one, it is said in the <I><a href=""/d/upanisad"" class=""d"">Upani&#7779;ad</a></I>, there are two birds in one tree. The two birds means I, individual soul, and God, the Supreme Soul. The individual soul is limited within this body. And God is everywhere, in every body, in every atomic particle, everywhere. Because I am individual soul, I can understand my bodily pains and pleasure. But I cannot understand your bodily pains and pleasure. But God, being all-pervading, He can understand my pains and pleasure, He can understand your pains and pleasure, He can understand cats' and dogs' pains and..., everyone. This is the difference between me and God. Sometimes they mistake, because God is also within this body, I am also within this body, therefore they think that there is no other individual soul than God, therefore I am God. So if I am God, then you are also God. And if there is more than one God, there is not God. God is one. There cannot be two. So if I think I am God, then everyone is also God, so God becomes plural, so there is not God. God is one. Therefore, God is great, we are small. In quality we are one. Just like the president and the citizen, as man they are one. But in power, the citizen and the president, they are different. So these things can be understood if one is sober and very great thinker: they can understand that God is situated with me, He can help me also.

<div class=""After-Verse"">(reads French Translation) So here in this verse, sixty-sixth verse, Eighteenth Chapter, <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says ""Give up all other forms of religion and simply surrender unto Me.

<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> So we have no responsibility. It is false, <I><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a></I>. Our only responsibility is how to become obedient servant of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. So that is only responsibility, one responsibility. Just like the political parties, they are advertising, different political party, ""I am your friend. Give me vote."" How he can be friend? Just like in America, the Nixon took vote, he was advertising ""America requires Nixon."" I have seen that advertised when he was being elected. But after some time, the people found that he is not required, ""Get out."" So nobody can become, because everyone is imperfect. How one can become friend or responsible for another person? Just like in your country, in Europe and America, so many hippies are there. Their parents are responsible, rich men, able men, but why they have become hippies? Is it not a fact? The father does not want that his son should become a hippie, but still he is becoming hippie. Where is his responsibility? You cannot give protection to your son. In spite of your desire, you are disappointed. So where is your responsibility? Who can answer? Where is your responsibility? You don't really like that your son should become a hippie, but you cannot protect him.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> That is false. That I am saying. This is false responsibility. Actually you cannot become responsible. You have no power. Everyone is under the laws of nature. Just like some birds flying in the sky. The father, mother, and children, but nobody is responsible for anyone. When there is danger in the sky, you cannot give protection. Suppose one bird is hit, he is falling. The father, mother, and others, they cannot give any protection. He has to become responsible for himself. Just like the aeroplane. When the one plane is in danger, no other plane come and help it. Even if you see that the other plane is flying a few yards and if it is in fire, you cannot help. There is one nice story that one hunter was hunting birds and he spread his network. So when the children of the parent birds, they become victimized by the network. So when the parents came, they saw, ""Oh, my children have been caught up by the net of the hunter."" So mother became very overwhelmed. She went to rescue them and she also become victimized. Then the father was intelligent, he saw that ""My children, my wife, they all have been victimized, and if I foolishly go to save them, then I will be also victimized. Let me go this way."" Take <I><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a></I> and go. No responsibility. It is not possible when everyone is captured by the laws of nature. How you can help and what is your responsibility? So this is called <I><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a></I>. The children are thinking that ""My father and mother will give me protection,"" and the father and mother is thinking that ""There is my responsibility."" This is called <I><a href=""/d/maya"" class=""d"">m&#257;y&#257;</a></I>. With this false responsibility, they are packed up in a home. But when death comes, nobody can help. Nobody. This is happening every day, every moment, and still we are falsely thinking I am responsible. So what is the value of your responsibility? If you cannot give protection, then what is the value of your responsibility? There is no responsibility. The only responsibility is that I have got this human form of life. Even in this life I do not realize God, then I remain cats and dogs, that's all. This is the only responsibility. If you miss this opportunity, then I do not know what I am going to become in my next life. So gaining or losing this opportunity, that is my responsibility. If I am not responsible... [break]</div>

<div class=""Purp-para"">But if the head, king, or president excuses him, he can save. So nobody in this material world can transcend or overcome the laws of material nature. But if one is devotee, by the mercy of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he can. This is the sum and substance. Therefore, we have no responsibility. If we have touched fire, then it must burn. So whatever we may be, very big man, we cannot violate the laws of nature. Tit for <a href=""/d/tat"" class=""d"">tat</a> we accept. So those who are violating laws of material nature, they suffer continuously. But when he takes to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's lotus feet shelter, sincerely surrendering, then he can be saved. Otherwise not. So everyone should become <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious, and he should try to save his relatives, friends, husband, wife, children from these clutches of laws of material nature by educating him to become <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious.
