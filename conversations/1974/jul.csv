Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:,Prabhupāda,This is sense.
Bhūrijana:,"Bhūrijana:Prabhupāda, I think my illusion is not yet dispelled.",Prabhupāda,Then unfortunate.
Bhūrijana:,Bhūrijana:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Continue. (laughter) Who can check?
Bhūrijana:,"Bhūrijana:I want to understand in this sense though, exactly how far your instructions are because I know I want to do it, what you say, but I am not exactly...",Prabhupāda,You are old student.
Bhūrijana:,Bhūrijana:Yeah.,Prabhupāda,"If you still cannot understand what is my instruction, then how can I help you? New students may say like that. You are intelligent, educated, old student. If you say... (long, silent pause) Our movement is that beginning of spiritual life is to surrender. If there is no surrendering, then it is no advance.Sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].This is the beginning. If that thing is lacking, there is no beginning even, what to speak of advancement. That is discussed already.Nasiddhiṁsaavāpnotinasukhaṁnaparaṁgatiḥ.This is the beginning of spiritual life. The word is called disciple. Disciple means who accept discipline. If there is no discipline, where is disciple? And ""disciplic succession."" We have used this word. Not that discipline is finished by one man, no. It will continue to go by succession. That is perfect."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:,Prabhupāda,"Naṣṭa,this word is used."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:""This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.""",Prabhupāda,"That's it. As soon as the discipline broken, then everything is lost. Now you can dance like a dog. That will not affect. Nobody can do that unless there is spiritual strength. Now, last night MadhudviṣaMahārājawas singing, and so many men became enthused to dance. So unless there is spiritual strength, it cannot be done. Others cannot ask and dance. No, that is not possible. That is not possible. Unless there is spiritual strength, you cannot enthuse others. So we should have to acquire spiritual strength by following the regulative principle.SanātanaGosvāmī has therefore forbidden.Avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇampūta-hari-kathāmṛtamśravanāmkartavyam:""Those who are not followingVaiṣṇavaprinciples, one should not hear from him."" Why? It isKṛṣṇa-kathā,Kṛṣṇa's. Nowsarpocchiṣṭa-payoyathā:""Milk is very good, but as soon as it is touched by a serpent, it is no more good. It is harmful."" So one must beVaiṣṇava. Unless one isVaiṣṇava, there is injunction, ""Don't hear from him. It will be poisonous."" So one who is not followingVaiṣṇavaprinciple, he cannot speak aboutVaiṣṇavaprinciple. It is harmful. That is forbidden byācāryas,SanātanaGosvāmī. If somebody says, ""What is the harm? He is chantingHareKṛṣṇa..."" He cannot chant. That is a show-bottle chant. That is not effective. But even taking that ""Anyone who is chanting, let me hear,"" no,SanātanaGosvāmī says, ""No, don't hear."" It will be harmful more than... In other words, if you are not following theVaiṣṇavaprinciple, you don't chant. It will not be effective. Did you not see the difference last night? There were many others. They could not join in the dancing. So far gathering men, if you do not gather intelligent men, then what is the use of gathering men?Ekaś candras tamohantinacatārāsahasraśaḥ:""If there is one moon, that is sufficient. What is the use of millions of stars?"" If one is perfectVaiṣṇava, that is sufficient. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhu's movement is... There are so many... Such a big instruction book. It is not that, whimsical. But still, we recommend that ""Go on chanting."" This will help you anywhere. That is also good. It is exactly like that: if you ignite wood for fire, if the wood is dry, the fire takes place immediately, and if it is moist, then it takes time. Only smoke will come. So smoke is not required. The blazing fire required. Then if from the wood, if simply smoke comes you cannot (chuckles) take any work out of it. There is traces of fire. As soon as there is smoke, there is fire, but it is not useful. It is useful for troubling your eyes only. What is smoke? Smoke means also fire. But you require blazing fire, not smoke fire. So blazing fire takes place if the wood is dry, immediately takes place. Otherwise, you go on enjoying the smoke. Be satisfied. ""When there is smoke, there is fire."" But it will not be useful. (chuckling) It will be useful, gradually the wood will dry. It takes long time. Just try to understand this example. You require the flame, not the smoke. But if you are satisfied with the smoke, that is your business. If you simply be satisfied—""The smoke is also fire. Unless there is fire, why the smoke comes?""—that's a good argument, but smoke will not help you. You require the flame. That flame cannot be produced if the wood is wet. Wet means materially contaminated. Is that example all right?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Yes, that's true.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So pure devotional service is flame. All other things are smoke. You must get the flame. Otherwise, your business will not get done. So naturally we fan when there is smoke, ""Phat,phat,phat."" As soon as flame comes, there is no smoke. So again fan it. Let the flame come. Then everything will be all right. Otherwise be satisfied with the smoke. You are cooking with smoke for three hundred years. (laughter) There is a very humorous story that one man... He was ayogi. So he approached. It is not story, it is fact. Approached one big man that... As people are very inquisitive to see some yogic magic, so the rich man asked theyogi, ""What you have learned about yogic perfection?"" ""No, I can in the severe winter season, I can dip myself in the water up to this and practiceyoga."" ""So, how long can you remain? At night?"" ""Yes. No, I can remain the whole night or as long as you..."" ""All right, if you remain within severe cold, within water, overnight, then I shall give you such and such presentation."" So he agreed, and he did it. And in the morning, when the man came, so he said, ""Oh, you are successful."" Then he did not... Either he had no money or he did not want to give. So he had his one advisor, ""So what shall I do?"" ""No, no sir, you cannot give money."" ""Why?"" ""Now, there was heat."" ""So how there was heat?"" You know, in India they giveākāśa-pradīpa?During Kārttika month they... This is ourVaiṣṇavaprinciple, I think. The lamp is there on the head of the roof. On the roof there is a bamboo, and in the top of the bamboo there is light. So this man was in the lake. And his advisor said, ""You have seen that the lamp was there, and heat was coming."" (laughing) That lamp was three miles away and still, he advised, ""Yes, there was heat. Therefore he could tolerate."" So what can be said? He is poor man. So there was another servant of that big man. So he appealed to him that ""See, I took so much trouble and he did not pay me anything."" ""So don't worry. I shall see that you are paid."" What is that? Some presentation?"
Paramahaṁsa,"Yes. First of all, I will pay my obeisances.",Prabhupāda,"Then that servant, while he was employed, there was an urgent business. The rich man said that ""Tomorrow I am going. You must come and go with me."" So suppose he was to go at ten o'clock. Then at nine o'clock a messenger came: ""You are ready?"" ""No, just I am cooking. Then I shall finish my cooking, take my meals and then we shall go."" So he was very angrily inquired, ""So why you did not...?"" ""No, I am cooking."" ""Where you are cooking?"" Now, he has three bamboos, and on the top there was a pot, rice pot, and he was giving fire here. So that rich man came and saw. ""What kind of cooking this is?"" ""No, there is heat. It is going on."" (laughter) ""So how you do this, such a nonsense."" ""No, if the temperature from the lamp on the roof of the sky could protect that man, why not it will be cooking?"" Then he could understand this is the reply. So that man was paid. So this kind of progress, cooking, three miles above, a pot, a little fire, it will not act. There must be proper adjustment of cooking. Then you can cook food and eat. A little smoke or little fire and three miles away the cooking pot, in this way, cooking is useless attempt. One must be serious to cook. There is method how to cook. If you don't adopt that method and if you cook in your whimsical way, you will never be able to eat. If you say, ""I shall cook in my way,"" and if you adopt that process, will it help?Nasiddhiṁsaavāpnotinasukhaṁnaparaṁ...So what are these things? [break] ...on the floor. But this instruction was for you, that you are keeping. I never keep myBhāgavataon the floor. I keep always my head. So better you take it. (laughter) I keep myBhāgavataeither on this table or on the head and never on the floor. So that is for you. (laughter) Yes. Then next? (laughter) Yes. It is good, nice."
Paramahaṁsa,This was knitted by a devotee who came from Sydney. A scarf for you to wear in the cold.,Prabhupāda,Hm. That's nice.
Paramahaṁsa,And I also brought one from me.,Prabhupāda,That's nice.
Paramahaṁsa,And some mangoes.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, that is good."
Paramahaṁsa,"From Queensland, very nice mangoes. They are very difficult to get.",Prabhupāda,Very good. The mango I like very much. Mango is the king of all fruit. Do you accept it or not?
Paramahaṁsa,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"It is the king of fruits.Roseis the king of flowers. There is a statement in theCaitanya-ca...Two fruits. One fruit is the nim tree fruit. You have seen nim tree? In not your country. Nim tree you have seen in India, and their fruits..."
Paramahaṁsa,A little bitter.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, very bitter. So the cuckoo, they try to eat the mango fruit flower when small, and the crow they eat that nim tree fruit. So amongst the birds also, there is discrimination according to the quality. Cuckoo sings very nicely. He is fond of mango fruit. And the crow is fond of this nim tree fruit. The white swan, they live in a very nice garden. There is lake, flower. And the crows, they live in the city. Of course, here in your country the garbage is not open. In India there is thrown anywhere and the crows... You have seen it?"
Devotees:,Devotees:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"They enjoy that.Tad-vāyasaṁ-tīrtham.It is mentioned in theBhāgavata.Tadvāyasaṁ-tīrtham.Find out this. No, it is in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Natad-vacaścitra-padaṁhareryaśopragṛṇītakarhicittadvāyasaṁ-tīrthamuṣantimānasāḥ."
Jagattāriṇī:,"Jagattāriṇī:Śrīla Prabhupāda, my friends have to leave now.",Prabhupāda,"[break] ...understanding of spiritual platform. It is impossible. Therefore, a human being, if he does not come on the spiritual platform, he remains animal. That is the difference. Therefore,Bhagavad-gītā,you will find the first beginning of teaching-dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā.Find out."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:,Prabhupāda,"This is the beginning of spiritual life, to distinguish between the soul and the body. One who does not understand that there is soul, there is no spiritual education because he is animal. The animal does not know that there is soul. A dog thinks, ""I am this body."" So this is the beginning of spiritual education. ThereforeKṛṣṇainstructs first this thing. Everyone is acting on the conception of body as self. She has also gone, your wife?"
Bhūrijana:,"Bhūrijana:No, she will come back.",Prabhupāda,"We... Our work is on that platform,dehino 'sminyathadehekaumāraṁyauvanamjaratathadehāntaram[Bg.2.13], dehina,not thedeha,dehi.We are not working ondeha.Dehameans body. Anddehimeans the owner of the body. So our thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness is about the activities of the owner of the body, not the body. But the whole world is going on on acting on the body. That is the difference. Therefore it takes very, very, long time to understand. Those who are thinking, ""I am this body..."" One who knows that ""I am not this body; I am soul, spirit soul,"" then his spiritual education... They do not know what is spiritual education. What do they mean generally, spiritual education?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Some religion, knowledge about one of the religions or nowadays meditation, like that.",Prabhupāda,"Meditation? What is the ultimate goal? That means no perfect knowledge. The so-called meditation is very popular, but what meditation? What is subject matter of meditation? You can close. It is closed?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Close the blinds? There's a draft coming in, but the windows are closed.",Prabhupāda,"Not closed. Yes, now it is closed. Just make it point three. It is on two. That's it. (long pause) [break]"
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:...have to strain the juice from this mango?,Prabhupāda,And did you do it?
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:No. I've seenPālikādo it with a cloth and then mix it with a little milk. [break],Prabhupāda,"...human being. It is not meant for the beast. God has given different food for different person, different. You will find even food grains, rice-first quality rice, second quality rice. Why nature has produced? Because there are persons who cannot eat third quality rice. So God has given: ""Oh, here is first-class quality."" They will eat little. And in India there are classes, they will eat so much. So for them that red rice is good. They do not like this fine basmati. I have got practical experience. Sometime we used to give even the servants the same rice. So this man came. He complained, ""Bahu."" ""Bahu"" means master. ""This rice is not suitable for us."" That fine basmati rice. He did not like it. Then the next day that red, big, big. Have seen that? Japanese rice or some, Burmese rice. It is reddish and big and little hard, and he likes: ""Very nice."" So there are classes of men, classes of animals. I have got practical experience of all this. The big animals... [break] ...living entities. That He is providing everyone. Nobody is hungry.Ekoyobahūnāṁvidadhātikāmān."
Devotee:,Devotee:So therefore it must be impossible to have a classless society such as the Communists are trying for.,Prabhupāda,"No, classless society isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. ""EatKṛṣṇa-prasādam."" Everyone will like. That is classless: ""Everyone chantHareKṛṣṇa, everyone eatKṛṣṇa-prasādam."" Life is successful. Classless society on the spiritual platform, not on the material platform. That is not possible.Brahma-bhūtaḥprasannātmānaśocati,samaḥsarveṣubhūteṣu[Bg.18.54].At that stage,samatā,equality, when one isbrahma-bhūta[SB4.30.20],spiritualized... Otherwise not possible. So Dipaka is not here? No, he has gone."
Madhudviṣa:,"Madhudviṣa:He's at the temple. He will be coming tonight, though. He usually comes to prepare you something before you take rest. I can send for him.",Prabhupāda,"All right, no, no. No, no, let him come. I am not in a hurry. What is the time now?"
Dr. Muncing(?):,Dr. Muncing(?):And Dr. Muncing.,Prabhupāda,"Ah, thank you very much. Sit down. There is a verse... You have got first part?"
Devotee:,Devotee:First part.,Prabhupāda,Idaṁhipuṁsastapasaḥśrutasyavā[SB1.5.22].
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Idam?,Prabhupāda,"Idaṁhipuṁsastapasaḥśrutasyavāsviṣṭasyasūktasyacabuddhi-dattayoḥ, avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhirnirūpitaḥ[SB1.5.22]."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:,Prabhupāda,Hm. Read.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Translation: ""Learned circles have positively concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, namely austerities, study of theVedas,sacrifice, chanting of hymns and charity, culminates in the transcendental descriptions of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry.""",Prabhupāda,"Purport. This is our process ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, everything engaged in glorifying the Supreme Lord. So you are learned scientists. Our request is that you also, by your scientific research, glorify the Supreme. That is perfection."
Dr. Muncing:,"Dr. Muncing:Excuse me, do you mind if I record this?",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:They can record it?,Prabhupāda,"Oh yes, why not?"
Dr. Harrap:,Dr. Harrap:(aside:) This stand's quite a complicated contraption here. It makes (indistinct).,Prabhupāda,"You can read this, Second Chapter, ""Perceiving the existence of the supreme scientist, Lord ŚrīKṛṣṇa."" Read this."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:(reads fromThe Scientific Basis ofKṛṣṇaConsciousness,Chapter 2, pages 11 through 19.)",Prabhupāda,So our request is that everyone with his talents should establish the authority of the Supreme. This is ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement.
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:Who was the author of that reading, sir? Who wrote it?",Prabhupāda,This book? This is one of my student. He is also scientist. You can read his...
Madhudviṣa:,Madhudviṣa:The centers are all over the world. We have centers in America and centers...,Prabhupāda,We have got forty centers in America.
Dr. Harrap:,Dr. Harrap:Forty.,Prabhupāda,"Forty, four zero, yes."
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:Your knowledge of Sanskrit, this is one of your basic interests.",Prabhupāda,"No, not Sanskrit, but knowledge we have received by disciplic succession from myGuruMahārāja, from my spiritual master. Sanskrit is the language but mostly we derive knowledge from Vedic revealed scriptures. And this is also one of them,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.This is the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge."
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:And you're interpreting this in terms of modern day living to a large extent in some of your writings, and, of course, some of your disciples writings, as in this book.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Could I borrow this for a moment? Thanks.,Prabhupāda,"Bhagavad-gītā,yes."
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:Yes, milkfat.",Prabhupāda,Milk is harmful? How it is harmful? If it is harmful why you are giving milk to the child?
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:There is a certain difference here in that milk that we get from cows has a very low proportion of what we call polyunsaturated fatty acids, only about two per cent, whereas in human milk this is about ten or twelve percent. It's a much higher level. So milk from cows, which are ruminants, is quite a lot different from the milk that we get from the non-ruminants, and of course, humans are non-ruminants.",Prabhupāda,"But I think there is a book,""Miracles of Milk,"" written by one American gentleman. He has greatly valued the milk and milk products. Similarly, we Indians, we give very, very importance to milk and milk products."
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:Yes, I think this is so, has always been so here, but in recent years there has been shown to be a relationship between the cholestrol level in the blood and the ratio between the saturated and polyunsaturated fat in the diet. The lower the level of polyunsaturated fat, the higher the level of cholestrol in the blood. And this has been associated with heart disease. So there is quite a move to, among many in the medical profession to prescribe diets which are low in saturated fats.",Prabhupāda,"(aside:) Have you got our picture,Kṛṣṇastealing butter?"
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:And we are doing some quite interesting work at the dairy research laboratory aimed at making ruminants' milk, cow's milk, much more like human milk in this way by a special feeding techniques to the cows.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, milk means cow's milk. Milk means cow's milk because you find in this book thatkṛṣi-go-rakṣya. Gomeans cow. Cow protection, cow's milk is important, not other animal's milk."
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:Yes, what about human milk?",Prabhupāda,Human milk is natural.
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:But we've had very close connections with India in the dairy research laboratory in that Dr. Chulak... Yes, you know him? One of our staff members some years ago spent several months in India developing methods of making cheese from buffaloes' milk.",Prabhupāda,"No, India's position is different now. India has practically no milk, and no food. Due to our leaders' mismanagement, there is no milk. India is depending on your milk powder sent by Australia or by Europe. There is no milk. But milk is very important becauseKṛṣṇasaid thatkṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁvaiśya-karmasvabhāva-jam[Bg.18.44].Find out that verse. You do not have thatKṛṣṇaBook? SoKṛṣṇa... We are following the leadership ofKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇawas so fond of cows, cows' milk, cows' butter, that He was stealing cows' butter. Yes. Find out that picture."
Dr. Harrap:,"Dr. Harrap:Well, you should... The advice is that you keep your general level of fats down, but of the fats that you take, you should increase the ratio between polyunsaturated and saturated. But there is quite a development of milk industry in parts of India. The complex near Annakadana(?), I think, is a very good example of this, isn't it, of the, I believe, the cooperative dairy complex.",Prabhupāda,"No, practically also we see. Formerly big, big saintly person they used to live in the forest, and their livelihood was fruits and milk. They used to keep cows and draw milk from them, and whatever fruits are available in the forest, and they have given us these literatures, Vyāsadeva. So the... He has writtenMahābhārata,one hundred thousand verses and similarly, thisŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,he has given us eighteen thousand verses. And each verse is full of so grave meaning that if you study, it will take months and months together. So they developed such nice brain simply by drinking milk and fruits. Yes."
Madhudviṣa:,Madhudviṣa:He wants... He would like to know what you think that Australia should help Asia with as far as making people more comfortable to live in this world and what Australia can imbibe from Asia as far as teaching in science as well as general living.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So far I have studied, not only Australia, but also America and Africa, there are immense land uncultivated. So I think all these countries... The population increased in India, China, and similar other places. They should allow to come them, come here and produce food grains. If you cannot manage the over-populated countries, they should come. If the government allows, they would immediately come and utilize the vast land for producing food grains. And in theBhagavad-gītāwe have the statement-find out,annādbhavantibhūtāni.Find out this verse.Annādbhavantibhūtāni. Cāru:"
