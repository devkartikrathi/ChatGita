John Nordheimer:,"John Nordheimer:Prabhupāda, it's been thirty-five years since you were given this mission by your spiritual master to bring the word ofKṛṣṇato the West. A lot has happened in the world over that period of time. The world has...",Prabhupāda,"That is nothing. That period of time is relative. As human beings, we live for some time-say for a hundred years—but there are demigods who can live for millions of years. And an ant will live for only a few hours. So this is relative. But time is eternal, and what is happening in so-called human history has no consideration from the viewpoint of eternal time. That is all relative. If there is some catastrophe in ant society, the ants may be very much concerned, but human society does not take any notice of it. Similarly, if a catastrophe occurs in human society, the demigods, who are higher than us, do not consider it. Some birds or cats or dogs may be fighting, and for them it may be a catastrophe, but for us it is nothing. This is the relative world, and we should know that what has happened in this world is not worthy of consideration in terms of universal affairs. Things are coming and going like seasonal changes.Arjunaput this question toKṛṣṇa: ""This is a catastrophe! I have to kill my own men."" AlthoughArjunabelieved this to be a catastrophe,Kṛṣṇalikened it to seasonal changes.Mātrā-sparśāstukaunteyaśītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ[Bg.2.14].""O son ofKuntī, the non-permanent appearance of happiness and distress and their disappearance in due course are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons."" In the winter season water is not very pleasant, but in the summer it is very pleasing. What then, is the condition of water? Is it pleasing or not? The water is the same, but in touch with our skin it becomes pleasing or not according to the climatic circumstances. Just because the summer is hot, should I give up cooking? Work must be done. Similarly, just because water is cold in the winter, should I give up my bath? No. These things may come and go, but we have to do our duty. Our duty isKṛṣṇaconsciousness; that is our philosophy, and that is an actual fact. These seasonal changes may come and go in life; sometimes they may please us, and sometimes they may pinch us, but our duty in human life is to understand God. We shouldn't care for all these catastrophes that come and go. We should have no concern, for their nature is like that—sometimes pleasing and sometimes not pleasing. Despite all this, we have to do our duty, understand God."
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:What about the future? Is it possible to bring more people intoKṛṣṇaconsciousness? To expand?,Prabhupāda,"Of course there are good men and bad men, and good men are taking to this movement because it is a good movement. ""Good"" means not having illicit sex, not eating meat, not indulging in intoxication, and not indulging in gambling. If anyone observes these four principles, he is considered a good man, and if he does not observe them, he is a bad man. So good men will take to thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, and bad men will not. We give distinct rules on how to become good, for if one does not become good, how can he understand God, who is all good? First we must become good men; then we can understand God. God is all good, and if we don't become good we cannot understand Him. That's all. It's up to us to make the choice. The past, present and future are open for everyone. There is no restriction; no one says, ""This class of men shall be good, and this class of men shall be bad."" Anyone can become good. If we educate a child nicely, he becomes good, but if we train him foolishly, he becomes a rascal. It is the duty of the government, of the father and of the teachers to make everyone good. If the government is bad, if the father is bad, and the society is bad—how can the child be good? Everywhere the government, father and society are bad; and therefore we are producing bad men, and therefore there is no peace and prosperity."
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:What about the men who surround you?,Prabhupāda,They're all good men.
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:They are good men who were raised in a bad society.,Prabhupāda,"No, they were raised in a bad society, but they have chosen to become good."
John Nordheimer:,"John Nordheimer:Is that preordained, or is it by free choice?",Prabhupāda,"Free choice. What is preordained? You are here of your free choice. If you like, you can sit down and talk with me, and if you don't like, then you can go. That is your free choice. Free choice makes destiny; if I act in goodness, then my future is good. And if I act badly, my future is bad. That is destiny. Man is the architect of his own destiny. If you are educated, your future is nice, and if you remain foolish, then your future is bad. Future destiny depends on present action. This life is an opportunity to make the next life, and if we behave like human beings, then in our next life we will go back home, back to Godhead. But if we behave like animals, then in the next life we will take animal bodies. That's all. All this is very nicely described inBhagavad-gītā.The conclusion is that human beings are meant for understanding God, but if we waste our time understanding dog, and if we become attached to dog, then we will become dogs in our next life. And if we are attached to God, we become like God, in our next life. The choice is ours."
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:Why does all this exist? Why the challenge in the first place? Whymāyā?,Prabhupāda,"Māyāmeans that you are unfortunate. Here it is light, and there it is darkness. If I tell you to come from the darkness into the light and if you don't come, that is your misfortune.māyāis there, and God is there. If you want to remain inmāyā,then how can you be saved? I can help you by saying, ""Don't remain in darkness. Please come out into the light."" But if you say, ""No, I shall remain here,"" then how can I save you? You have your choice. God is there, andmāyāis there. If you take tomāyāyou remain inmāyā.What can I do, and what can God do? That is your choice."
John Nordheimer:,"John Nordheimer:Who createdmāyā,man or God?",Prabhupāda,"The government may create a prisonhouse, but why do you go there? Does the government invite you there? No, you become a criminal and go there. The prisonhouse is there and the university is there. Why do some people go to prison rather than the university? The government is not partial to people; it does not say, ""You live in this university and be educated, and you go to the prison and live there."" It is in the individual's choice. Similarly, God has created so many things, but it is our duty to follow God's instructions. God says,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja:[Bg.18.66] ""Just give up all nonsense and surrender unto Me. I shall give you all protection."" That is God's declaration. Why don't you take to that? God is all powerful, and He may create so many things for some purpose, but why don't you follow God's instructions? God says, ""Surrender unto Me,"" so why not surrender? Why surrender tomāyā?That is the individual's choice. Another example: the government does not want the youth to become hippies, but they are abandoning a wealthy life just to lie down in the street. In London I've seen many boys lying on the street. Why? We Indians may lie on the street because we are poor, but they are not poor, nor the Americans. Why has some of the younger generation accepted this way of life? You have enough food, enough house, enough money, facilities, machines—everything. Why are they accepting this kind of life?"
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:They reject what they see.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, but they are coming from respectable fathers, from a respectable nation. Why are they rejecting this mode of civilization?"
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:They don't really find it respectable.,Prabhupāda,"Therefore everyone has his choice. That you have to accept. Why do you forget it? God has given us everything, and now it is up to us to make our choice. So God is good, and if we follow His instructions, we become good."
John Nordheimer:,"John Nordheimer:What problems do you have in making His word, His instructions reach the ears of everyone in the world?",Prabhupāda,We are not preaching our own words; we are preaching God's words. Now it is up to you to make your choice. God says to give up all engagements and just surrender unto Him. God says:
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:What is the role of women inKṛṣṇaconsciousness?,Prabhupāda,There is no distinction between men and women.
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:I keep hearing about certain propensities women have that would separate them from propensities men have.,Prabhupāda,"Well, it is still man's duty to become the husband and woman's duty to become the wife; so these propensities are there. But all this can be adjusted. I have many students and am getting them married, and they are living peacefully and advancing inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Not that everyone isbrahmacārī.We have manygṛhasthasand children. In this way the propensities of the women and those of the man are adjusted. A man wants a woman, and a woman wants a man, so we say, ""All right, take it. Live peacefully, but don't change partners."" We don't allow divorce; once they're married there is no separation. Nor do we allow boys and girls to live together as friends. If a man wants a woman and a woman wants a man, they should become united by marriage, live peacefully and advance inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is our proposal. In this way all facilities are there in this movement. Our program is to make people become godly, and everyone should help us. Every sane man should help this movement for the good of society."
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:What about the United States government?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, it should come forward. My students here are all United States citizens. I have not imported them from India. They are Americans, and they are in difficulty. So why shouldn't the government come forward? Their character is being formed, and they are becoming God conscious by participating in this movement. The government is spending millions of dollars to stop LSD and other drug intoxication, but my students are giving up everything simply by following my word. So why isn't the government coming forward to help me?"
John Nordheimer:,"John Nordheimer:They don't care about the people, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"But don't they want good for their own men? I am stopping American boys and girls from taking LSD and other drugs, and the government is spending millions of dollars to do this. It is only practical that they come forward to support this movement."
John Nordheimer:,"John Nordheimer:Understanding is needed, for I know some of the misconceptions that exist about your movement.",Prabhupāda,Are the misconceptions cleared?
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:I hope so.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, we invite everyone to come here to listen to our philosophy, takeprasādamand sing and dance with us. This program is very nice. We do not make distinctions in human society. We do not say that we shall serve the Indians and not the Americans or the Americans and not the Africans. We are going everywhere with this movement. We take all human beings to be part and parcel of God. Not only human beings, but every living entity—animals also."
John Nordheimer:,"John Nordheimer:(laughing) It's already been suggested that we (the New York Times) are not divinely inspired. At any rate, this book-",Prabhupāda,"If one gets a diamond, he possesses something valuable. But in this civilization you are simply making plastic plates and plastic cups. Indeed, inJapanI have seen pasteboard homes. And everyone is thinking that he is advanced. Formerly people used to have golden and silver utensils, but now they have plastic ones, and still they are very proud to be so materially advanced. What is your position? You have a bunch of paper and think, ""I am a millionaire."" What is the value of that paper? Is that not cheating? However, if we possess gold or diamonds worth a million dollars, that is actual wealth. But we are educated in such a way that we think we are millionaires by paper only. As soon as there is some catastrophe, millions of such dollars could not buy bread. This actually happened in Germany; millions of marks could not purchase one piece of bread. All this is going on in the name of advancement of civilization, and the real purpose of life, God consciousness, is missing. So every thoughtful man should come forward to understand this movement and take it seriously. Why are the people being misled? We just have to try to understand this philosophy, the basic principles of God consciousness."
John Nordheimer:,John Nordheimer:Can you really expect to change the whole society?,Prabhupāda,"That I have already explained. The change is up to you; it is your choice. If everyone becomes God conscious, the world becomes the kingdom of God."
John Nordheimer:,"John Nordheimer:Many people have tried to change the world, but we see that they have failed. Many people have tried to see God, but they do not succeed.",Prabhupāda,"That is because their purpose is not strong. That is due tomāyā,forgetfulness. Just like darkness and light; if your light is strong, there is no darkness. But if you have no light, or if your light is not very strong, there is darkness. This is the principle: If you want to drive away darkness, you must bring light. That is the only medicine. You don't have to make a separate endeavor to drive away darkness. As soon as you bring light, darkness will go. The motto of our magazineBack To Godheadis: ""Godhead is light, nescience is darkness. Where there is Godhead there is no nescience."" This is also the Vedic"
Disciple:,"Disciple:Prabhupāda, its time forBhāgavataDharma.",Prabhupāda,BhāgavataDharmais already finished here. (laughter) You go and speak. (turning to interviewer) At least write in your paper that we are not sentimentalists. We have a large philosophic background. Thank you.

Guest (1):,"Guest (1):Jodhpur, Rajasthan.",Prabhupāda,"Jodhpur, Rajasthan. She is your wife? You are from also Rajasthan?"
Woman:,Woman:Jodhpur.,Prabhupāda,"Jodhpur? Same place. We had been in Jaipur. Great function we had. (Hindi) In whatever profession you are, you try to satisfyKṛṣṇaby your professional talent. Then your...Bhagavānis not stereotyped, thatBhagavānbecomes... Just likeBhīṣma. He was great devotee, and in the battlefield ofKurukṣetraBhīṣmawas piercing the body ofKṛṣṇaby arrows andKṛṣṇawas feeling very nice. So it is not thatKṛṣṇais satisfied simply by throwingroseflower. Sometimes a devotee throws arrow andKṛṣṇabecomes satisfied. So we can satisfyKṛṣṇain so many ways.Kṛṣṇais varied. He is not stereotyped. But we must know the art how to satisfyKṛṣṇa. Then our life is successful."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):How can we realizeKṛṣṇais satisfied?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, you'll realize when you satisfy actually. You have to take direction. Just like you are engineer or business administrator. You learn the art from a teacher, and then you can know how you are satisfying your master. Just like if you eat, then you can understand that ""how we are being satisfied."" You haven't got to ask anybody, ""Am I satisfied?"" If you are eating, then you'll be satisfied. Similarly, if you serveKṛṣṇaaccording to the superior direction, then you'll understand thatKṛṣṇais satisfied. First of all you have to learn how to satisfy, and then, reciprocally, you'll be aware thatKṛṣṇais satisfied with you by the result."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Swamiji,Kṛṣṇasays inGītāthat ""Do your duty without, unmindful of result."" But when we do our duties, or so-called normalkarmas,we are always aware of the result. Like when you do a job you're aware that you're getting a check every two weeks and so on. Similarly, even the small things in our life, we are always first looking for the result as a matter of, I mean, these worldly people we are.",Prabhupāda,"The result is... Here there is no check. Just like these boys, these American boys, European boys. They have seen enough checks and they can pay enough checks. But they are not after checks. They are after Kṛṣṇa's service."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):Does it mean that we should leave the work and we should not work and...,Prabhupāda,"No. That I have explained. You work for the satisfaction ofKṛṣṇa. That is called ""Don't see to the result.""Kṛpaṇa,kṛpaṇāḥphala-hetavaḥ.Kṛpaṇa.There are two classes of men. One iskṛpaṇa,and one isbrāhmaṇa.Kṛpaṇa,they want his sense satisfaction, andbrāhmaṇa,they want Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction. Satisfaction must be there but when you want your satisfaction, that iskṛpaṇa.Kṛpaṇāḥphala-hetavaḥ.He wants to enjoy the result. That is the whole world. Material world means everyone wants his sense satisfaction, but the same way, when you'll satisfy Kṛṣṇa's senses, then you becomebrāhmaṇaorVaiṣṇava. The result must be there. If you work, there must be some result, bad or good. But if you want to enjoy, yourself, then you arekṛpaṇa.And if the result is enjoyed byKṛṣṇa, then you arebrāhmaṇa.Result must be there. Any work you do, there must be some result, and that is also described in the...Yajñārthātkarma.Yaj&#241ameansViṣṇu. For His sake one should work.Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁkarma-bandhanaḥ[Bg.3.9].If you work not foryaj&#241a</a>,</span> for your sense gratification, then you become bound up by the result of the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/karma"" class=""d"">karma</a>,</span> good or bad.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> That I have explained. Just like <a href=""/d/arjuna"" class=""d"">Arjuna</a>, who was a fighter, warrior, means he fought for <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. For himself, he was hesitating.

But he was not thinking in terms of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He was thinking in terms of his own benefit, ""whether I shall go to hell or heaven."" That was his contemplation. Therefore he was taught <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> And after understanding <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> he agreed to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's proposal. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/karisye"" class=""d"">Kari&#7779;ye</a> <a href=""/d/vacanam"" class=""d"">vacana&#7745;</a> <a href=""/d/tava"" class=""d"">tava</a> na&#7779;&#7789;o <a href=""/d/mohah"" class=""d"">moha&#7717;</a> sm&#7771;tir <a href=""/d/labdha"" class=""d"">labdh&#257;</a>:</I> [</span></I>Bg. <a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/73?d=1"">18.73</a>] ""Now my illusion is gone.

And when he was trying to become nonviolent, very benevolent to the family, he was chastised by <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/asocyan"" class=""d"">A&#347;ocy&#257;n</a> anva&#347;ocas <a href=""/d/tvam"" class=""d"">tva&#7745;</a> <a href=""/d/prajna"" class=""d"">praj&#241&#257;</a>-<a href=""/d/vadam"" class=""d"">v&#257;d&#257;m</a>: </I>[</span></I>Bg. <a href=""https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/11?d=1"">2.11</a>] ""You are talking like a very learned man but you are fool.""

We are all living entities, part and parcel of God. We are spirit soul. So this is not our business, birth, death, old age and disease. So bondage means so long you'll get this material body you are under this bondage: birth, death, old age, and disease. Because you are very rich man, getting good salary, it does not mean that you will not die, or disease will not attack you. This is bondage. First of all try to understand what is bondage. Bondage and freedom. Bondage means to be subjected to the condition of this material body. That is called bondage. The body may be elephant's body or tiger's body or Brahm&#257;'s body or ant's body, but that is bondage. Because as soon as you get a material body you are under this bondage of birth, death, old age and disease. So your problem is how to get out of this bondage, not that to accept the bondage&mdash;just like I am bound up by iron shackles&mdash;""Let me be bound up by golden shackles."" So that is bondage.

<div class=""Normal-Level""><span class=""Bold"">Satsvar&#363;pa:</span> We have our temple in Dallas. I don't know if any of you have been there. It's on Gurley Street, off East Grand, very big building there, and we have a school there for children &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da has started, called Gurukula. It's based on Vedic philosophy that the children at a very early age is the best time for them to learn these principles so that later in life, whether they become householder life or whatever business they take to, they will know the principles, how to avoid sinful activities, knowing love of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. So we have about thirty children there now, and &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da has come to Dallas... He's traveling all over, but he's come here just for a few days to see this school, to see how his devotees are managing the children. He's given us so much advice how to improve the school. Also while he's here, coincidentally you would say, but <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is in control. So his arrival, we received Deities, large Deities of <a href=""/d/radha"" class=""d"">R&#257;dh&#257;</a> and <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, marble Deities, forty-eight inches. And so tomorrow &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da is going to install these Deities in our temple. That's going to be early in the morning, at eight o'clock. But then all day long, up until the evening there will be distribution of <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/prasadam"" class=""d"">pras&#257;dam</a></span> and... Just the idea of coming out to see the Deities. Most of the devotees... There are about a hundred devotees back at the temple now and they are all working very, very quickly, hard, to get everything ready.</div>

As &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da was saying, the name is not different than <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. We chant on our big <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/japa"" class=""d"">japa</a></span> beads. The holy name is the same as <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is in His form or in the picture or the same as His philosophy. And so these Deity forms, we don't consider them as marble Deities but as <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> Himself. People misunderstand. They think this is idol worship, that we are worshiping some idol, bowing down to idols. Same with the food, they don't understand. We offer food to the Deity. But <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says in the <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> that ""If you offer Me a little fruit or a leaf or water...""</div>

So just by His seeing, by His glancing... Try to come and see all these things. And every Sunday we have a festival there. Every evening we have classes on <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a> As It Is.</span> And as long as we students repeat what &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da said, they have the same potency.

Why not think in that way? Their theory is that all other planets there is no life. Only this planet is favored by God, there is life. We say even in the sun planet there is life.

<div class=""Conversation""><B>Prabhup&#257;da:</B> Naturalist. Anyway, you can call him a philosopher. So the basic point is wrong. Starting is wrong. Starting point is mistake and illusion. Therefore, the next point is cheating. If you start from wrong conception of life, then if you distribute knowledge, that means cheating. You do not know, still you are distributing knowledge. But this rascal Darwin, he has no clear idea. He is simply theorizing, speculating, and misleading people. Therefore, he is cheating. So if I cheat you and you cheat me, then how you can expect perfection of life? It is a society of cheating, and that is actually going on. Everyone is thinking, ""How I have gorgeous way cheated you."" That is politics, diplomacy. If you can cheat your friend very cleverly, then you are supposed to be very big man. Big lawyer means the law is there, but if he can cheat the law, then he is big lawyer.</div>

It is very prominent now in this age. Conditioned soul means these four defects&mdash;to commit mistake, to become illusioned, to cheat others, and imperfectness of the senses. The scientists say that we do not know, that means imperfectness of sense. I am trying to see but the cloud is checking me, and I am considering beyond this cloud there is nothing. That is imperfectness of my seeing. Not... It is not a fact that beyond the cloud there is nothing. So these things are going on&mdash;cheating, illusion, mistake, and imperfect. And they are trying to come to a right conclusion. Just like somebody was telling that there is going to be a big conference of the Catholics to consider what wrong they have done. They can see that the people are rejecting the so-called Christian religion. So now they are thinking (indistinct). But it is also another cheating.
