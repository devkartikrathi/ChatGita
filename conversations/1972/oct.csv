Dr. Kapoor:,"Dr. Kapoor:...here atRādhā-Dāmodara. After his long tour of the world in which he got passed the message of ŚrīKṛṣṇaCaitanyaMahāprabhuin the differentkarmas,to the different nationalities of the world. This return back to homeland of Śrīla Prabhupāda, is particularly significant, because this time he comes back with a host of his western disciples. This signifies to me the meeting of the East and the West, or at least the beginning of such a meeting. This signifies the victory of spiritualism over materialism, of good over evil. This is really a rare moment in history, for for the first time in the history of the world, for the first time at least living memory, Vaiṣṇavism, the message of Vaiṣṇavism, the message ofMahāprabhu, the message of devotion and of pure devotion has been carried to the west and carried so successfully. I am sure that historians of the future will have a lot to say about Prabhupāda and his movement, and they will be even envious of us for living in a time when this movement was begun and for participating in it. I have a secret realization that at this moment, while we are welcoming Prabhupāda, ŚrīRūpaGosvāmī, ŚrīJīvaGosvāmī, ŚrīKṛṣṇadāsaKavirāja, whosesamādhissignify their eternal presence in the sacred precincts of this temple, are also joining us in welcoming Prabhupāda, and they are showering their choicest blessings upon him. I can hear them saying, ""Long live Prabhupāda, long live Prabhupāda."" I am sure as a result of their presence, Prabhupāda will live long for many, many more years, to broadcast the message ofCaitanyaMahāprabhuall the world over and inspire us to inspire us with a special zeal in our hearts. And I am sure as a result of their blessings he will rise always, from glory(?). I have also a secret realization that ŚrīRūpaGosvāmī andJīvaGosvāmī are not only showering their blessings upon Prabhupāda but also upon the western disciples of Prabhupāda that have come along with him and saying that in the process will be realized (?) the message of ŚrīCaitanyaMahāprabhu, and surely and steadily advance on the path of peace, happiness, and divine grace.",Prabhupāda,"So blessings of Dr. O.B.L. Kapoor. He is aVaiṣṇava. Although by age he is my younger brother, we are Godbrothers, and for the last forty years perhaps, since he was a student at Allahabad and I was doing some business there, we are known to each other. So his association is a great blessing for us. But this reception is actually not my reception. It is the reception of my foreign students. ŚrīCaitanyaMahāprabhuwanted that His message should be broadcast all over the world, in every village and every town, and myGuruMahārājaattempted. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura distributed his literature. I think, in 1896, he sent his first book,Teachings of LordCaitanya,and I saw in McGill University that book. And I do not know. That was the year of my birth also, 1896. So somehow or other, later on, I came in contact with BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatīGosvāmīMahārājain 1922, and he immediately asked me that ""Why don't you go to the foreign countries and preachCaitanyaMahāprabhu's blessings."" So I was little surprised. Especially at that time, I was very young man and I was newly married. I got one son also. So it was my mistake that I did not take up the words of BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatīGosvāmīMahārājaimmediately. I thought that ""I am now married. Let me settle down."" Perhaps if I would have joined from 1922, by the blessings ofGuruMahārāja, I could do more preaching work. Anyway, it is better late than never. After my retirement, I was living in theKeśī-ghāṭa, Nāthagrāma(?)Rādhā-KṛṣṇaTemple. But this Gosāijī, Gauracanda Gosāijī, he asked me, ""Why don't you come here?"" So I left that place. I came here. And with some arrangement, I took this room. But I was always thinking that ""GuruMahārājaasked me, and he asked also some of my other God-brothers, but up till now, nothing has been done. So let me try, at least, at the fag end of my life."" So I leftVṛndāvanain 1970 and went to New York. Uh, not. 1965. At the age of 70 years. But for one year I had no place to live. I took some of my books,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,printed here, up to three parts, First Canto. And I was personally selling these books to the book sellers and to the persons any way. With great difficulty I was pulling on. And New York is a very expensive city, a great city, a great forest. (laughs) And I am poor man. So then it is a long history. Then I began chanting in the Tompkinson Square, and I think, in the first day this boy,AcyutānandaMahārājanow, he and another boy,BrahmānandaMahārāja, he is also preaching in Africa, these two boys danced, and this photograph was published in the New York Times with great details. That was the first encouragement. And after chanting in the park, many young men and girls used to come to my apartment and my meeting place. In this way I started, first in New York, then inSanFrancisco, then Montreal, then Boston. In this way, now we have got about one hundred branches all over the world, forty branches in America. Big, big cities, Australia, I mean to say, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Boston. What is that? Other cities?SanFrancisco."
Devotees:,Devotees:Dallas.,Prabhupāda,"Dallas. Dallas we have got very nice temple. Detroit. I thought that our temple, Los Angeles temple, is the best. But this year I went to Dallas. Oh, it is better than Los Angeles. (laughter) It is so nice. Now we are trying to purchase the Berkshire palace in England. Yes. That was being occupied by the Duke of Windsor. I don't think whether I have got, received one letter from. No. So the price is 500,000 dollars."
Dr. Kapoor:,"Dr. Kapoor:500,000 dollars?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. $500,000 means five crores according to Indian rate."
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:(laughing) Fabulous.,Prabhupāda,"So I had no money, (laughter). But one nice boy—his name is known all over the world, George Harrison—he has promised to give me loan."
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:Kṛṣṇahas all the money.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So actually, we are spending not less than seven lakhs of rupees per month throughout the whole our institution. But by the grace of God,Kṛṣṇa, we are selling our books very nicely."
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:That's very encouraging. That's most encouraging.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. We are selling our books, average, at the rate of 25,000 rupees per day."
Dr. Kapoor:,"Dr. Kapoor:Ah. That is unbelievable, I must...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So they are selling magazines, books, and especially ourNectar of Devotionis selling like hotcakes. (laughter)Nectar of Devotion.SoKṛṣṇais encouraging. There is no scarcity. And I am traveling throughout the world at least twice in a year. And each time we have to spend... Now we purchased $20,000 ticket for four persons. $20,000. $20,000 means how much in Indian exchange? $20,000 to ten times."
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:200...,Prabhupāda,"200,000. That means two lakhs. So our expenditure is going like that. Keep books. And we print at least ten thousand books, fifty thousand books. OurKṛṣṇaTrilogy.Have you got here,KṛṣṇaTrilogy?You have seen?"
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:No.,Prabhupāda,"Show him that book,KṛṣṇaTrilogy.That is selling. That is now recommended in some of the colleges as textbook.Nectar of Devotionis also recommended as a textbook in the Temple University, Pittsburgh. (indistinct)"
Dr. Kapoor:,"Dr. Kapoor:Ācchā,very good. That's very good. Students are accepting in all earnestness.",Prabhupāda,Oh yes. Accepting. Accepting. No. This isBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.
Dr. Kapoor:,"Dr. Kapoor:This also, I haven't seen yet.",Prabhupāda,"Oh. This isBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.This is being published by MacMillan Co. They printed in the last half month of August, fifty thousand. That is now finished, now going to second edition."
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:Ah.Kṛṣṇais working wonders.,Prabhupāda,"So, what is this?"
Devotee:,Devotee:Trilogy is not at this place. I think we have it here.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, that's all right. So by the grace ofKṛṣṇa,CaitanyaMahāprabhu, whichever book we are publishing, that is being accepted. And people inquire when they go forsaṅkīrtanain big, big cities, they inquire, ""Have you got this book? Have you got this book?"" Yes. And we are receiving mail orders, at least twenty mail orders. And this time I was surprised. They have taken a godown in Los Angeles. This is bigger than theRādhā-Dāmodaratemple, so big. Only for stocking books and incense. We are manufacturing incense. That I suggested. Sometimes I went to Ramakrishna mission and I saw they are selling incense. So I suggested that ""Why don't you..."" So I gave them idea how to manufacture. Because I have..."
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:You have the background.,Prabhupāda,I can give them. They are asking me about my pain liniment and the eczema ointment. (laughter) I can give them. I can give them.
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:You can tell them you are now sellingKṛṣṇa-bhakti.,Prabhupāda,"But I warned them that ""Do not become too much business."" (laughter)yāvadarthaḥprayojana.You require some money. So you are selling this incense and books.Kṛṣṇais giving us sufficiently. If you divert your attention, I can give the whole pharmacopeia because I have got good experience to manufacture. So in this wayKṛṣṇais meeting our expenses, the expenses. And not only that. These American young boys, they are fully cooperating. These boys and girls. Where is that girl, Śāradīyā? Here is nice girl. You see. And where is your husband? Oh. Oh, why you are so skinny?"
Devotee:,Devotee:In Bombay he had jaundice.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. So give him sugar candy water. Bring in the morning. You know sugar candy? The sugar candy... Soak sugar candy at night in a glass, and the first business in the morning you should take that glass of water, sugar candy."
Śāradīyā:,Śāradīyā:He is doing all that now.,Prabhupāda,"Ah. And he should not take at all ghee. No fatty preparation. And if it is possible, secure papaya, raw papaya, green, and boil it in the... These are the medicine for jaundice. He is inside this room? He has come back?"
Devotee:,Devotee:(indistinct),Prabhupāda,"So, so you have come toVṛndāvana, and just go on withbhajana,RūpaGosvāmī's place, and we are trying to construct a temple."
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:Yes. You are very lucky in almost getting I think that big building on the bank of theYamunā. (indistinct) Kuṭir. It's a huge thing. A huge thing.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. (conversation in Hindi for a few minutes) Rādhārāṇī asked him that he must do. She is alsopakkabaniya.(laughter) Without the order of Rādhārāṇī,... He has got... But when he says Rādhārāṇī, Rādhārāṇī is asking, then he cannot refuse. Thank you very much.Ācchā?Soprasādam.Give themprasādam.Is there anyprasādam?"
Gurudāsa:,Gurudāsa:Oh yes.,Prabhupāda,So distribute.HareKṛṣṇa.
Dr. Kapoor:,"Dr. Kapoor:I think the journey is so, fast because it is not in time. Time is transcended.",Prabhupāda,Time has nothing to do. That is stated in the Second Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamthat time has no influence there.
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:Neither day nor night.,Prabhupāda,"No, there is no such thing."
Dr. Kapoor:,Dr. Kapoor:Modern conception of speed is within the sphere of time. But our journey transcends time. Naturally it has to be faster than any journey you can imagine.,Prabhupāda,"No. We speak from theśāstra.There is no question of imagination. We speak fromśāstra.So we have explained, tried to explain these things inEasy Journey to Other Planets.And people are taking it very nicely. It is sold very quickly, very quickly. [break] I would like to see you that you are living in palaces."
Yaśodānandana:,Yaśodānandana:We want to putKṛṣṇain palace.,Prabhupāda,"Kṛṣṇais giving you the opportunity, you Americans. Now you are takingKṛṣṇaconsciousness, you will be the most opulent nation of the world.Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇaboth. You have gotLakṣmī, but if you takeNārāyaṇa,Lakṣmīwill be permanent.Lakṣmīwill not go.
