Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:No. If we get that house, Prabhupāda...",Prabhupāda,You can get.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:We can get?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, why not? You have appealed to the king, and he is willing. Why can you not? What is the difficulty? Now it is your business how to induce, induce him. There is chance, ninety percent chance."
Haṁsadūta:,"Haṁsadūta:In which way will it be most helpful, in giving money personally or inducing others to give money? He will give money?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, otherwise..."
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:How much money?,Prabhupāda,Ten lakhs.
Haṁsadūta:,Haṁsadūta:Ten lakhs. They can give the full amount?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, why not? This man... It is to be very carefully tackled. This king is going to die very soon. And as soon as the king dies, the queen's position is very precarious, almost finished. So if she becomes our president, she'll continue to keep her honor and prestige. That's a fact. She's a good lady. We have no objection to make her the president of the local center. And she is American. She will be able to tackle these American boys and girls with motherly affection. And we shall keep her always in good respect so that throughout her life she shall be honored all over as she was, as she was honored with her husband. This is a fact. So you have to convince her. And I think if the other ladies who are..., her daughter-in-law and granddaughters, like that... Because her son is dead. He was the king. This old man being invalid, his son was king. And I think that middle-aged woman was there. You have marked this? She might be her daughter-in-law and the young girls might be grandchildren. One of them, one of the daughters, girl, was very beautiful. So it appears that she comes from the royal family.Rāja-kanyāKing's daughters are very beautiful. That is fabulous in India, king's daughter,rāja-kanyā.In India if anybody gets a good dowry and a beautiful wife it is said,arddhe rajatvaekarāja-kanyā(?) Actually we have seen in..., whenDevakiwas married toVasudeva, how much dowry. Can anyone imagine now? So many thousands of horses, chariots, elephants, maidservants, all decorated with gold ornaments. One cannot imagine even at the present moment. Therefore they talk of ""legends."" But actually such dowries were given when a king's daughter was married. Not only royal family, even in ordinary family still, those who are rich, they spend lots of money to be married, either son's marriage or daughter's. When one spends lots of money during the marriage of one's daughter and son he is considered to be really rich man. That is the proof that he is rich man. So we can begin. He cannot rise, this, what is called, Muktananada? That's all right. Where he is?"
Devotee:,"Devotee:Muktananda, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,Yes. You come here. Girls may sit here. You can sit comfortably on this. (Devotees come in and sit down.) What is that?
Kauśalyā,Her baby. Her child. Her son.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. So we were talking ofAjamila, abrāhmaṇaresident ofKānyakubja, presently known as Kanauj. So,kānyakubjedvijaḥkaścidasitpatir...,asitkaściddāsī-patirajāmilaḥ,nāmnānaṣṭa-sadācārodāsyaḥsaṁsarga-dūṣitaḥ.That, what is known as, at the present, prostitute, they were know asdāsya,dāsī.(aside:) Don't make sound, ""cut, cut."" Silent.Dāsī...Thekṣatriyakings also, when they married, with dowry many maidservants would follow the queen. That was thekṣatriyasystem. SoAjamilawas the illegal husband of a prostitute,dāsī,dāsī-pati.Actually one should be husband ofdharma-pati,religiously married, not a friend or a husband of illegal marriage. That is not allowed.Dāsī-patirajāmilaḥnāmnā...Ajāmilanāmnā.His name wasAjāmila. Why the sound is in...? It is not possible to charge? ""Cut, cut cut, cut.""Naṣṭa-sadācāraḥ. Sadācārameans good behavior. Why good behavior was lost?Dāsyaḥsaṁsarga-dūṣitaḥ.Because he was associating with a prostitute, illegal sex. Therefore, anyone who wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must besadācāra.His behavior must be very regulated.Asadācārī,unclean, nonregulated, cannot make any progress. If somebody says that ""Whatever you like, you can do. There is no difference. You can imagine your own way..."" This is going on nowadays. ""Whatever you like, you can do. You can imagine your own way of self-realization."" But that is not recommended in the Vedic literatures. One must besadācāra.This is the beginning ofsadācāra,to rise early in the morning, to cleanse, then chant, or chant the Vedicmantrasor, simplified as in the present age,HareKṛṣṇamantra,mahā-mantra.This is the beginning ofsadācāra.Sosadācārameans to become freed from sinful reaction. Unless one follows the regulative principles he cannot be freed. And unless one is fully freed from sinful reaction he cannot understand what is God. Those who are not insadācāra,regulative principles, for them... Just like animals, they are not expected to follow any... Of course, by nature they follow regulative principles. Still, but human being, having advanced consciousness, so instead of using it properly, they misuse the advanced consciousness and thus they become lower than animals. The animals, for want of advanced consciousness, cannot follow any regulative principles. But by nature they have got some regulative principle. A human being, advanced consciousness, instead of using it for advance in spiritual life they use it for sense gratification and thus they become lower than the animals. So as soon as one becomes irregulated, without anysadācāra,then he doesn't care for any sinful activities for maintaining his body and soul together. He doesn't mind. Their philosophy is, what is called? ""Existence is the first law of nature,"" or something like..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Self-preservation.,Prabhupāda,"Self-preservation. So self-preservation... They do not know what is self-preservation. That is another ignorance. They consider this body as the self. Their self-preservation means to keep this body. And that is also not possible. If you do not follow regulative principles, it is not possible to keep your body in good condition. That is also not possible. Those who do not follow the regulative principles, mostly they are diseased, some kind. We find in the medical, modern medical shop the customers are educated people. Mass of people, they are not customers in the medical shop. You'll find it. They are not so much diseased. In every gentleman's house, modern, you'll find so many bottles of medicine. But you won't find such medical bottles in any house of less educated persons. They are not so diseased. So this is one of the items. If you want to advance in spiritual life you must follow the regulative principles to rectify your mistakes in the past life and this present life. Without being freed from all contamination nobody can understand God. That is not possible.Bhagavad-gītāsays,yeṣāṁantagataṁpāpaṁ:""One who has become completely freed from all kinds of sinful reaction,""yeṣāṁtvanta-gataṁpāpaṁjanānāṁpuṇya-karmaṇām,""Persons who are engaged in pious activities only,""te,""such person,""tedvandva-moha-nirmuktā...[Bg.7.28].This life, the material life, isdvandva.Dvandvameans fighting or quarreling. Every one of us has got nature for fighting with others unnecessarily. Even some people come here with a spirit of fighting with me. So this is calleddvandvaandmoha.How this fighting spirit becomes developed? On account of illusion. What is that illusion? Accepting this body as self. So if one is contaminated by sinful activity—if he is in illusion, how he can..., illusion of accepting this body as self—what is the meaning of their self-realization? He's illusioned. He'll keep himself in all kinds of contaminated life, and artificially he thinks that by some kind of mystic meditation he'll be all right. This is going on. No. One must follow. Meditation, yogic meditation, is also possible when there isyama,niyama,āsana,praṇāyāma—the eight principles ofyogasystem. And nobody follows the eight principles ofyogasystem and simply sitting down and meditating, that will not help. The first two steps areyama,niyama,thenāsana,thenpraṇāyāma,thenpratyāhāra,thendhyāna,thendhāraṇā,thensamādhi.These are explained in the yogicśāstraorBhagavad-gītā.So this man, although born of abrāhmaṇafather... Now, here it is said thatnaṣṭa-sadācāra.Although he is born of abrāhmaṇafather, hisācāra,his dealings for advancing in spiritual life...Abrāhmaṇais expected to be truthful, to be self-controlled, to be fully cognizant of spiritual life, practical application in life,jñānam,vijñānam,āstikyam,to have complete faith in the statement of theśāstras.That is... That is calledāstikyam.We, according to our Vedic system, we do not accept any other system of religion because we consider themnāstika.That is the primary principle.Nāstikameans one who does not believe in theVedas.He is callednāstika.Not that he does not believe in God. One may believe in God, but one who does not believe in the Vedic literature, he is callednāstika.Vedanamanīyābauddhahailanāstika.LordBuddha, although he is accepted as incarnation of God, but because he defied the Vedic principles it is said,nindasiyaj&#241a-vidherahahaśruti-jātaṁ.LordBuddhacriticized the, I mean to say, sacrificial ceremonies because in the sacrificial ceremonies sometimes there is recommendation of killing an animal. But he was preaching nonviolence. So he criticized even the sacrifice inyaj&#241a</a>.</span> He criticized. <span class=""Italic"">Nindasi...</span> But a <a href=""/d/vaisnava"" class=""d"">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> is praying, ""My dear Lord, you are defying the Vedic principles."" He knows why the Lord is now defying the Vedic principles; therefore he is devotee. In spite of Lord Buddha's defying the Vedic principles, a devotee is offering him obeisances. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/kesava"" class=""d"">Ke&#347;ava</a> <a href=""/d/dhrta"" class=""d"">dh&#7771;ta</a>-<a href=""/d/buddha"" class=""d"">buddha</a>-<a href=""/d/sarira"" class=""d"">&#347;ar&#299;ra</a> <a href=""/d/jaya"" class=""d"">jaya</a> <a href=""/d/jagadisa"" class=""d"">jagad&#299;&#347;a</a> <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">hare</a>.</span> He knows the Lord, how He is playing, how He is bewildering the atheistic class of men. The atheistic class of men did not believe in God. Lord <a href=""/d/buddha"" class=""d"">Buddha</a> says, ""Yes, you don't require to believe in God. There is no God. But you feel yourself that when you are attacked with violence you feel pain. Why should you offer to others?"" Because his mission was to stop animal killing. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sadaya"" class=""d"">Sadaya</a>-<a href=""/d/hrdaya"" class=""d"">h&#7771;daya</a>-<a href=""/d/darsita"" class=""d"">dar&#7779;ita</a>-<a href=""/d/pasu"" class=""d"">pa&#347;u</a>-gh&#257;tam.</span> The Supreme Lord became too much compassionate when he saw that people are unnecessarily killing animals, as it is going on still. Instead of... At least those who are claiming Buddhist, they are killing animals. Bruce, is it not? Yes. But in the Buddhist religion there is no sanction for killing animals. Yes?</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> (Hindi) Muhammad, he also did not believe in the Vedic literature. But according to Vedic literature, anyone who does not believe in the Vedic literature, he is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/nastika"" class=""d"">n&#257;stika</a>.</span> Just like the Mohammedans, they say, ""Anyone who does not believe in Koran, he is <span class=""Italic"">kafir.""</span> The Christians say, ""Anyone who does not believe in the Bible, they are heathens."" That is there everywhere. Similarly, Lord <a href=""/d/caitanya"" class=""d"">Caitanya</a> said that <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/veda"" class=""d"">veda</a> <a href=""/d/na"" class=""d"">na</a> <a href=""/d/maniya"" class=""d"">man&#299;y&#257;</a> <a href=""/d/bauddha"" class=""d"">bauddha</a> <a href=""/d/haila"" class=""d"">haila</a> <a href=""/d/nastika"" class=""d"">n&#257;stika</a>.</span> He is giving the definition because we have to follow the great personalities, great <span class=""Italic"">&#257;c&#257;ryas.</span> That is our process. We do not make any research, or we do not make any statement made by us. We simply accept the injunctions given by great <span class=""Italic"">&#257;c&#257;ryas. &#256;c&#257;ryop&#257;sanam.</span> That is the process of Vedic system. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/tad"" class=""d"">Tad</a>-vij&#241&#257;n&#257;rtha&#7745; <a href=""/d/sa"" class=""d"">sa</a> <a href=""/d/gurum"" class=""d"">gurum</a> ev&#257;bhigacchet </span><span class=""Ref_Italic""></B></I>[MU</span></B></I> 1.2.12]<span class=""Italic"">.</span> One must approach a spiritual master and learn from him.

Just like nowadays <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is being interpreted in so many foolish ways because they do not accept explanation from the authority. They become themselves authorities. Therefore misused. That is not explanation. Somebody is explaining that <a href=""/d/kuruksetra"" class=""d"">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> means this body, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/panca"" class=""d"">pa&#241ca</a>-<a href=""/d/pandava"" class=""d"">p&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava</a></span> means the senses. These are all nonsense. You have to accept <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> as it is. When you cannot understand, you should get it explained by your spiritual master. Therefore one has to accept a spiritual master to understand. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/tad"" class=""d"">Tad</a>-vijnan&#257;rtham.</span> In order to understand that transcendental science one must approach a bona fide spiritual master. That is injunction. So here it is said that <span class=""Italic"">k&#257;nyakubje <a href=""/d/dvijah"" class=""d"">dvija&#7717;</a>. <a href=""/d/dvijah"" class=""d"">Dvija&#7717;</a></span> means he was offered the sacred thread. That means he was born in a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> family. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/janmana"" class=""d"">Janman&#257;</a> <a href=""/d/jayate"" class=""d"">j&#257;yate</a> <a href=""/d/sudrah"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra&#7717;</a>.</span> Everyone is born a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a>,</span> a foolish. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">Sudra</a></span> means a foolish man who simply laments. That is the real meaning of <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> Anyone who has no intelligence, he is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> We also generally say, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/gadah"" class=""d"">gad&#257;h</a>,</span> less intelligent. So <span class=""Italic"">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> <span class=""Italic"">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> <span class=""Italic"">vai&#347;yas,</span> they are called higher <a href=""/d/caste"" class=""d"">caste</a>. According to their... <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> first-class because his intelligence is first-class. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/ksatriya"" class=""d"">K&#7779;atriya</a>,</span> his intelligence is second-class. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/vaisya"" class=""d"">Vai&#347;ya</a>,</span> his intelligence is third-class. And <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> means fourth-class. And less than <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a>,</span> they are called <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/pancama"" class=""d"">pa&#241cama</a>, <a href=""/d/candala"" class=""d"">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</a>.</span> They are accepted as animals, those who are less than <span class=""Italic"">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> This is the Vedic system. Now, here it is said that this <a href=""/d/ajamila"" class=""d"">Ajamila</a>, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/dvija"" class=""d"">dvija</a>... <a href=""/d/dvija"" class=""d"">Dvija</a></span> means he was properly initiated, second birth. First birth by father, mother, is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> Anyone, even if he is born in a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> family, the natural birth is considered as <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> But if there is <span class=""Italic"">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-<a href=""/d/samskara"" class=""d"">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra</a>,</span> then he's accepted as born <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> born <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> Still, one is born <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> he has to undergo the <span class=""Italic"">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras.</span> So our, this... Now it is known as <a href=""/d/hindu"" class=""d"">Hindu</a> society although the ""Hindu"" word is given by the Mohammedans. It is called <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sanatana"" class=""d"">san&#257;tana</a>-<a href=""/d/dharma"" class=""d"">dharma</a></span> or <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/varnasrama"" class=""d"">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> society, who very strictly follow the four divisions, social divisions of <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/varna"" class=""d"">var&#7751;a</a></span>&mdash;<span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/ksatriya"" class=""d"">k&#7779;atriya</a>,</span> <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/vaisya"" class=""d"">vai&#347;ya</a>,</span> <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sudra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span>&mdash;and four divisions of spiritual life&mdash;<span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a>, <a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>, v&#257;naprastha,</span> and <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</span> So our, the Vedic system is called <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/varnasrama"" class=""d"">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/varna"" class=""d"">Var&#7751;a</a></span> means the social order. <span class=""Italic"">&#256;&#347;rama</span> means spiritual division. Therefore those who are following strictly the Vedic principle, that family life is called <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a> <a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>. &#256;&#347;rama.</span> Whenever you add this word <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> there is spiritual significance. So all the division-<span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a>, <a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a>, v&#257;naprastha,</span> and <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a></span>&mdash;they are known as <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> Anyone can understand <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> As soon as there is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> that means ""Here some men, saintly persons, spiritually advanced persons, lives."" That is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> So that <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>,</span> when a student follows the regulative principles, he is supposed to be situated in <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a> <a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> A householder living with family, husband, wife, children, if they are following strictly the regulative principles&mdash;<span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/grhastha"" class=""d"">g&#7771;hastha</a> <a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> Similarly, retired life, if he is following the regulative principles&mdash;the <span class=""Italic"">v&#257;naprastha <a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> Similarly, a renounced life, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a>,</span> if he is following the regulative principles, that is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasa"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;sa</a> <a href=""/d/asrama"" class=""d"">&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> Not that imitating somebody, I put on a saffron dress and I become a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sannyasi"" class=""d"">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> and by begging I live. This has killed the whole <a href=""/d/hindu"" class=""d"">Hindu</a> society or the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sanatana"" class=""d"">san&#257;tana</a>-<a href=""/d/dharma"" class=""d"">dharma</a></span> society. Unqualified persons, they do not know the regulative principles but for solution of economic problem they dress themselves. This is <a href=""/d/kali"" class=""d"">Kali</a>-<a href=""/d/yuga"" class=""d"">yuga</a>. They will pass on simply by the dress without any knowledge. So here also, although <a href=""/d/ajamila"" class=""d"">Ajamila</a> was born of a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> father and he was strictly following the regulative principles of a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span>&mdash;that will be stated&mdash;but he fell. He fell in love with a prostitute And therefore his characters were lost. <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/nasta"" class=""d"">Na&#7779;&#7789;a</a>-sad&#257;c&#257;ra&#7717;.</span> The reason is why? <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/dasyah"" class=""d"">D&#257;sy&#257;&#7717;</a> <a href=""/d/samsarga"" class=""d"">sa&#7745;sarga</a>-<a href=""/d/dusitah"" class=""d"">d&#363;&#7779;ita&#7717;</a>.</span> Because he associated with a prostitute, therefore his all regulative principles became lost. And as soon as you are lost of regulative principles then you take to all kinds of sinful activities. The regulative principles will keep you on the standard of life.

I can escape the king's law by doing something which is abominable but I cannot escape God's law. That is not possible. Therefore, although he is thinking that ""Now I am cheating this person,"" or ""I am stealing and getting some profit,"" that is not good for him. Just like a man is killing some man, another man. So that is not good for him because as soon as he will be arrested he'll be hanged.

If you get a dog's body you suffer according to that. If you get a man's body... Suffering will be there more or less as soon as you get this material body. Therefore &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva said, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/na"" class=""d"">na</a> <a href=""/d/sadhu"" class=""d"">s&#257;dhu</a> <a href=""/d/manye"" class=""d"">m&#257;nye</a>:</span> ""You are acting abominable.

So for some of your activities in the past life you are now suffering, and if you go on, continuing committing this nonsense, then you will again, you will have to again accept a body and you'll suffer. Therefore <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/garhitam"" class=""d"">garhit&#257;&#7745;</a>.</span> There are so many things to know but these things are not discussed nowadays. Very cheap thing: ""You can do whatever you like. You simply meditate and become God, that's all."" So much cheating is going on everywhere, all over the w</div>
<A NAME=""339560""></A><div id=""339560""> </div>
<div class=""Normal-Level"">orld. So-called yogis, they go, ""Oh, you meditate. You are... And as soon as you realize, you are God, within six months."" No. Therefore in this age the only method... It is a concession to the fallen people of this world, this <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mantra"" class=""d"">mantra</a>.</span> They 'll not be able to follow all the regulative principles; therefore they must commit all kinds of abominable activities. Under the circumstances the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a></span> or God has given a concession that you simply chant <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mantra"" class=""d"">mantra</a></span> and gradually you will be elevated to the highest position of spiritual life. Other things you cannot follow. You are already fallen. So you take to this process of chanting <a href=""/d/hare"" class=""d"">Hare</a> <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/mantra"" class=""d"">mantra</a></span> without any offense. And in order to save yourself from the offenses, a little austerity that you cannot have illicit sex life. Why should you have illicit sex life? Everyone's need is sex life. <span class=""Italic"">&#256;h&#257;ra-<a href=""/d/nidra"" class=""d"">nidr&#257;</a>-<a href=""/d/bhaya"" class=""d"">bhaya</a>-maithunam.</span> These are the bodily needs. So <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/sastra"" class=""d"">&#347;&#257;stra</a></span> has sanctioned, ""All right. You can live peacefully by married life and have sex life for children, good children."" That is allowed. But why should you have illicit sex life? What is this? Irresponsible life. ""I shall not take responsibility of family life, and I shall go on as so-called bachelor and have illicit life."" But that is not good. That is <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/garhitam"" class=""d"">garhit&#257;&#7745;</a>. <a href=""/d/na"" class=""d"">Na</a> <a href=""/d/sadhu"" class=""d"">s&#257;dhu</a> <a href=""/d/manye"" class=""d"">m&#257;nye</a>:</span> ""This is not good."" This is the advice of Vedic literature. Ultimately you'll suffer. You are thinking at the present moment that you are avoiding suffering because family life is very responsible life. So if you think that family life is responsible, yes, it is responsible life. If you don't take, if you cannot take the responsibility, then remain as a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a>.</span> Why should you marry? Yes. If you practice <span class=""Italic"">brahm&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> then you become free, seventy-five percent freedom immediately. But you do not want to undergo the austerities of a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmacari"" class=""d"">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a>,</span> and still, you want to remain as an unmarried man. Everywhere in the world it is going on. This is increasing. That is stated here, <span class=""Italic"">sad&#257;c&#257;ra. <a href=""/d/nasta"" class=""d"">Na&#7779;&#7789;a</a>-sad&#257;c&#257;ro <a href=""/d/dasyah"" class=""d"">d&#257;sy&#257;&#7717;</a> <a href=""/d/samsarga"" class=""d"">sa&#7745;sarga</a>-<a href=""/d/dusitah"" class=""d"">d&#363;&#7779;ita&#7717;</a>.</span> The illicit connection with man and woman will certainly make him abominable, fallen down to this abominable life. I... When I was... In my younger days, when I was in business, so I was to take agency one of big company, Smith's Transit Company. So they had to... I had to give some guarantee of my honesty. So in that program the question was whether married or unmarried. Because unmarried man mostly become dishonest. So that inquiry was there, ""Whether he is married?"" Married man cannot be dishonest because he has got responsibility. If he is arrested he will be insulted in his family. His family members will be in difficulty. Therefore he does not commit dishonesty very easily unless it is absolutely... But that should not be done. But unmarried man, because he has got no responsibility, he commits all kinds of sinful activity. That's a fact. Therefore in our <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement we do not allow such illicit sex life, no. You must get yourself married. And practically, we are seeing, that is very effective and that is going on nicely. All right. (Hindi)</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> They are sincere, sincerely seeking after. Their material business is finished because they have enjoyed enough of material things. Now there is spiritual inquiry. That is natural. When our material necessities are complete, we enjoy, then next stage is spiritual hankering. And that is explained in the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/vedanta"" class=""d"">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href=""/d/sutra"" class=""d"">s&#363;tra</a>, <I>ath&#257;to <a href=""/d/brahma"" class=""d"">brahma</a> <a href=""/d/jijnasa"" class=""d"">jij&#241&#257;s&#257;</a></I>.</span> After finishing <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/karma"" class=""d"">karma</a>-<a href=""/d/kandiya"" class=""d"">k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya</a></span> life... <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/karma"" class=""d"">Karma</a>-<a href=""/d/kandiya"" class=""d"">k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya</a></span> life means you do pious activities and enjoy life.

But the fact is that even you get your birth in a very rich family, you cannot avoid the sufferings of this material nature. Just like yesterday we had an interview with Holkar(?), His Highness Holkar, the old gentleman. So he was a king. He has got very beautiful wife, very beautiful family, very palatial building, but he is not happy, we saw. So the foolish people, they do not know that in this material life there is no happiness. They hanker after these palatial buildings, the motor cars, the bank balance, and so on, so on. Therefore those who have enjoyed all these things but have not become happy, there is another inquiry: ""How to become happy?"" [break] ...say America, they have enjoyed material life. Their children have enjoyed material life to the fullest extent but they are not happy. Therefore they have come to this spiritual life.</div>

Life membership means the member is entitled to all the books that we have printed plus all the books we will print in the future, plus a lifetime subscription to our magazine, <span class=""Italic"">Back to Godhead.</span> And the member is entitled to stay at any one of our branches throughout the world free and if he happens to travel abroad or in India. We will have our branches. So that life membership fee is 1,111 rupees. And then we have donor membership. The donor member is entitled to all the books that have been printed, a lifetime subscription to our magazine, but he does not get the books in the future. That is 555 rupees. And subscriber membership, lifetime subscription to our magazine, which is 222 rupees. Or there is membership, yearly subscription to our magazine. In this way we're trying to recruit members that support our movement. This movement is being supported just by literature. So in this way we can flood the whole world with <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness and then there'll be a change. If we want to see a change in the world, then we have to distribute knowledge of <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in this way. You are welcome to become a member. And also your friends. Tell them about our membership programs.</div>

Newspaper starting is not a losing business provided you can organize. Just like ordinary newspaper, they give... In daily news... People want to learn daily news, and they supply huge quantity.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> Yes. So we have to organize. First of all let us publish in one city, big city like New York, like London, yes, Bombay, Tokyo. Big cities, world's big cities. In India only two cities are big: Calcutta, and Bombay, important. If you publish simultaneously, Calcutta... Delhi is given importance due to capital; otherwise not important as big city, as Bombay and Calcutta. Delhi, without government offices it is a dead city. Just like Washington. What is the value of Washington? It is nothing. Simply because it is headquarters of the President, it has got importance. Similarly, Delhi is that. Otherwise it is not important. But Calcutta, Bombay, is really important city in India, big business, port, all rich men, every kind of, all cultural, everything&mdash;Calcutta, and Bombay. Originally only Calcutta, now Bombay also. Because the Britishers, they made Calcutta capital. And Calcutta was very, very important city. But these Calcutta men, they create sometimes situation, very complicated. So once in 1905 the same situation was there, politically. Sir Surendranath Bannerjee made, Surendranath Bannerjee's movement, partition of Bengal. Lord Collier, he wanted to divide Bengal, made it East Bengal and West Bengal. And Surendranath Bannerjee... He is the practically father of Indian politics. Gandhi's not. He was. He was. And in the beginning, in European circles he was famous. He was called ""Surrender-not."" The spelling of the name, s-u-r-e-n-d-e-r, Surendranath. In Parliament he was known as ""Surrender-not."" He was a very powerful politician. So there was trouble in Calcutta; so therefore they transferred, 1911, capital to Delhi. Otherwise, from the very beginning of British occupation Calcutta was the capital. You have seen the government viceroy's house near that Hamilton building where you were trying to purchase.</div>

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Prabhup&#257;da:</span> What is the value of vote by asses? According to Vedic civilization, there was democracy but that democracy is selected committee. Just like in England there was Privy Council. So selected body of learned <span class=""Italic"">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and sages, they were guiding the king, and the king himself was properly educated how to rule over, under religious principles. He was trained from the beginning of his life as prince. As the future heir of the throne, he was trained, and at the same time, he was guided by a council of learned sages and <span class=""Italic"">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> They were looking over the activities of the king. As soon as there was some mistake they will see. And there are instances; whenever there was a bad king they were dethroned. Not for political purpose. He was dethroned but his son was on the... Just like Lord <a href=""/d/ramacandra"" class=""d"">R&#257;macandra</a> did. <a href=""/d/ramacandra"" class=""d"">R&#257;macandra</a> killed <a href=""/d/ravana"" class=""d"">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> but He never occupied the kingdom. His brother <a href=""/d/vibhisana"" class=""d"">Vibh&#299;&#7779;a&#7751;a</a> proved to be faithful. He was enthroned. From the same family. And that was the system. Even a king was wrong, he would be dethroned but from his family, either his son or brother, or somebody would occupy there. Not that ""Because I have conquered you, therefore I shall sit down."" No. There are many instances. And therefore India was ruling all over the world. The emperor was in India, and the kings of different states, their family was. So there was no rebellion. And in every state a king was trained in the same process, guided by committee of learned <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> and sages. How perfect this monarchy is. Monarchy... That Lord Collier studied that the Indian people like monarchy. Even these states, the so-called states... Now the Congress government has killed them; otherwise the Britishers were maintaining, necessary, and they were developed. Now see. The Indore was far better before. You can see from the buildings, from the whole city. It was very prosperous city. Still it is going on. So every state, the native prince, the Britishers maintained so many native prince. And because they maintained them, they were friends to the Britishers. They knew the policy, if you create <span class=""Italic"">zamindar,</span> landlord. They created this aristocratic class to support them. So when <a href=""/d/gandhi"" class=""d"">Gandhi</a> and other leaders started this movement all the princes and <span class=""Italic"">zamindars,</span> they were in favor of British.

He went to a <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/brahmana"" class=""d"">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> and asked him&mdash;he was a great learned scholar&mdash;""Can I help you any way?"" And the pandit replied, ""No. I don't require your help. I am quite satisfied."" ""How you are satisfied?"" ""Oh, my, these students, they bring some rice. So my wife boils that, and I have got this tamarind tree. I take some leaves and prepare some juice out of it. That is sufficient."" So he was satisfied. That's all. But he was a learned scholar. Similarly, Canakya Pandit... You have perhaps heard. He was the greatest politician. He was prime minister of India. He was living in a cottage and just giving instruction. So that is India's Vedic civilization. Everyone is satisfied, self-sufficient. And now in your country, oh, you have to attend office fifty miles off.
