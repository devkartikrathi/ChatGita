Hayagrīva,Good.,Prabhupāda,"The first scene is that people passing on withsaṅkīrtanamovement as we have, as we usually do, very nice procession withmṛdaṅga, karatālasand that bugle, all people, just in the ordinary way. We have to make a nice procession. The second scene is thatKali, the personifiedKali, a person should be decorated blackish. A blackish man with royal dress and very ugly features. And his queen, another ugly featured girl or lady. So they are disturbed. They'll talk between themselves that ""There issaṅkīrtanamovement now and how we shall prosecute our business of thisKali-yuga?"" There will be, in that scene, in some corner somebody is drinking. Two or three persons drinking. The scene will be like that. They are sitting in the center. In one corner somebody taking part in drinking, and another part somebody is illicitly talking of lust and love with woman. In another section there is slaughtering of a cow, and another section gambling. In this way that scene should be adjusted. And in the middle, the ugly man, black man, and the ugly woman will talk that ""We are now in danger. Thesaṅkīrtanamovement has been started. What to do?"" In this way you have to finish that scene."
Hayagrīva,NowKaliis depicted as a male. As male?,Prabhupāda,"As male, yes."
Hayagrīva,Because sometimes I know he's depicted as female.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Male, his feature black, and dressed like a king. Black means ignorance. And similarly the scene is also blackish."
Hayagrīva,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"These things should be ascertained(?). Then, it is mentioned there, exhibit illicit sex, slaughterhouse, intoxication, gambling. Then the third scene is very nice.Rāsadance."
Hayagrīva,"Uh... Just before this... I'm not going to make this I don't believe either eastern or western, but I think this can apply for the whole world in the sense that the names may be Indian names, but I think the exhibition of the assembly ofKaliand his consort sin and the exhibition of illicit sex and slaughterhouse, this can all be, it can be from western type prototype.",Prabhupāda,"That may be. No, why should you... It may be sometimes misunderstood that western people are only under the influence ofKali. Because the world is under the influence ofKali. Not that in your country only this intoxication, illicit sex. No, everywhere it is."
Hayagrīva,I realize that.,Prabhupāda,More or less. More or less.
Hayagrīva,Not only in that scene. My point is that I don't want to make this an Indian play.,Prabhupāda,That you may do. That you may do. I have no objection. But people may not misunderstand that here a scene is depicted simply criticizing the western way. That is my point. Yes.
Hayagrīva,"Yes. Now that other person, that other LordCaitanya... Roy? Who wrote the other LordCaitanya? That other play?",Prabhupāda,"No, nobody..."
Hayagrīva,I showed you that other play.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, that Dilip Kumar."
Hayagrīva,Yes. That's what I had in mind. I thought it was strictly an Indian type of play.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that was Indian type. Yes, that was Indian type. Or if you like... I have no objection. If you present the characters in European style. ButCaitanyaMahāprabhu..."
Hayagrīva,"No, no. They wouldn't be presented in a western style, but there wouldn't be neither an eastern nor a western flavor.",Prabhupāda,That will be very nice. That will be very nice.
Hayagrīva,"In other words, it could be anywhere.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,"The situation could be... Because it's transcendental. It's not here, it's not there.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes. No, theKaliis not transcendental.Kaliis material."
Hayagrīva,"Yes. The earth, the whole world is affected, so it's not just one section.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Not only earth, this earth. It is whole universe."
Hayagrīva,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"So next scene isrāsadance.Rāsadance meansKṛṣṇaand Rādhārāṇī in the center, and thegopīs,they are surrounding. You have seen that surrounding scene they were dancing the other day in the park, hand to hand."
Hayagrīva,"Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"So oneKṛṣṇaand onegopī,they are dancing. That should be, scene should be... Then therāsadance should be stopped andKṛṣṇawill talk with thegopīs.Kṛṣṇawill say to thegopīsthat ""My dear friends, you have come to Me in this dead of night. It is not very good because it is the duty of every woman to please her husband. So what your husband will think that you have come in such dead of night? A woman's duty is not to give up her husband even he is not of good character or if he is unfortunate, if he is old, or if he is diseased. Still, husband is worshiped by the wife. So you have come here, it is very sinful. So you... People will decry it. Please go back. Now we have finished."" So in this way thegopīswill reply that, ""You cannot request us to go back because with great difficulty and with great, I mean to say, ecstatic desire we have come to You, and it is not Your duty to ask us to go back."" In this way you arrange some talking thatKṛṣṇais asking them to go back, but they are insisting, ""No, let us continue ourrāsadance."" Then when therāsadance is finished, thegopīswill go, thenKṛṣṇain Hishalilak(?), He says that ""They are My heart and soul, thesegopīs.They are so sincere devotees that they do not care for family encumbrances and all, any bad name. They come to Me. So how shall I repay them?"" He was thinking. ""How shall I repay their so ecstatic love?"" So He thought that ""I cannot repay them unless and until I take up their situation to understand Me. Because I Myself cannot understand Me. I have to take the position of thegopīs,how they are loving Me."" So with that consideration He took the form of LordCaitanya. ThereforeKṛṣṇais blackish, LordCaitanyais of the color of thegopīs.The whole life of LordCaitanyais representation ofgopīs'love towardsKṛṣṇa. That should be painted in that picture. You have got to ask anything?"
Hayagrīva,This is His determination to incarnate as LordCaitanya.,Prabhupāda,"LordCaitanya, yes."
Hayagrīva,In order to...,Prabhupāda,"In order to appreciateKṛṣṇain the form ofgopī.Just like I have got dealings with you. So you have got your individuality, I have got my individuality, but if I want to study how you are so much obedient and loving to me, then I have to go to your position. It is very natural psychology. Yes. You have to paint in that way."
Hayagrīva,I think that's clear.,Prabhupāda,"Huh? That's clear.Accha.Then fourth scene is lunar eclipse. You'll have to arrange a scene that just in the evening there is appearance of the full moon on the side of the Ganges and people are taking bath half in the water and half above the water, and they're all chanting, this same scene,HareKṛṣṇa,HareKṛṣṇa, withmṛdaṅgaand... Yes. So somebody comes,Advaita.Advaitacomes in the scene to take bath in the Ganges and begins to dance. ""Oh, my mission is now fulfilled! My mission is now fulfilled!"" He'll talk. He was very sorry to see the condition of the people that everyone is engaged simply for material sense gratification. Nobody is engaged in love of Godhead. So he wanted to rectify their behavior, but he thought that ""I am ordinary man, what can I do? IfKṛṣṇaHimself comes, then He can do it."" Therefore he worshipedKṛṣṇa, and he simply offered Ganges water andtulasīleaf. In this wayKṛṣṇahas taken His incarnation as LordCaitanya. So he has understood now at this moment LordCaitanyais now taken His appearance. So he was dancing, ""Now my mission is fulfilled. Now my mission is fulfilled."""
Hayagrīva,That'sAdvaita.,Prabhupāda,"Advaita. Lunar eclipse, everyone taking bath in the Ganges and chanting."
Hayagrīva,AndAdvaitais introduced there and he's very joyful on this occasion because he had requested that this incarnation...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He prayed. He prayed toKṛṣṇathat ""You come."""
Hayagrīva,He's aware at this time that this is the occurrence of Lord Caitanya's incarnation.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes. So this scene should be entered like that.
Hayagrīva,"Now I noticed in the list of characters we have up here, Rādhārāṇī. She doesn't appear at this point.",Prabhupāda,No. Rādhārāṇī will be in therāsadance?
Hayagrīva,Oh. In therāsadance.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,That's the...,Prabhupāda,"Rādhārāṇī andKṛṣṇain the center. AndKṛṣṇahas expanded Himself for othergopīs,hand to hand."
Hayagrīva,"That's the third scene, therāsadance. So Rādhārāṇī appears in that?",Prabhupāda,"That's the third scene, yes. There is the appearance, appearance of Rādhārāṇī."
Hayagrīva,The damsels ofVṛndāvanaappear also in the...,Prabhupāda,"No, the dance was inVṛndāvana. Yes.Rāsadance was inVṛndāvana."
Hayagrīva,The damsels ofVṛndāvanaalso appear in the third scene.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Third scene. Yes.Rāsadance of LordKṛṣṇaand His associates, Lord Kṛṣṇa's determination."
Hayagrīva,All right. Now we have the fourth scene. DoesAdvaitaspeak to anyone in the fourth scene or is that...?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,Is there anyone there? Any of these characters there? I'm trying to introduce these characters.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, certainly."
Hayagrīva,The characters should be introduced in the first act.,Prabhupāda,Yes. There should be...
Hayagrīva,"A few of them. Not all of them, but a few of them should be...",Prabhupāda,Śrīnivāsa. Śrīnivāsa andHaridāsa.Haridāsacharacter is there?
Hayagrīva,"Yes, I have this.",Prabhupāda,Yes.Haridāsashould be a old man.
Hayagrīva,"SoAdvaitais old too, isn't he?",Prabhupāda,Advaitais old.
Hayagrīva,And Nivas.,Prabhupāda,He is not so old. He is middle-aged man.
Hayagrīva,"Could you give me a brief rundown on their...? Are they devotee, they're devotees...",Prabhupāda,"Just like the picture is,Advaita, say, his age is about forty years, andHaridāsaandAdvaita, he was about more than fifty years old at that time whenCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas born. They were quite old men. His father's age."
Hayagrīva,They're all devotees.,Prabhupāda,"They're all devotees. WhenCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas propagating Hissaṅkīrtanamovement thebrāhmaṇas,the orthodoxbrāhmaṇas,they took objection. ""This is not according toHinduśāstra.This is something new."" But only these two gentlemen, they...Advaitahappened to be the head of thebrāhmaṇacommunity. So his support... And he was a well-to-do man, he was rich man, influential man. His support made Caitanya's movement successful in Nabadwip. He was a very influential man. And similarly, Śrīnivāsa, he was also, he belonged to thebrāhmaṇacommunity. AndAdvaitagave shelter toHaridāsa.Haridāsawas a Muhammadan. So he was punished by the Muhammadan magistrate and he took shelter at the house ofAdvaita. He was maintaining him. You can make them appear in the scene. They were talking betweenHaridāsaand Śrīnivāsa andAdvaitaand all of them chanting and dancing, ""Now our mission is fulfilled."""
Hayagrīva,"Yes, I see. All right. Now the fifth scene...",Prabhupāda,"Fifth scene, Lord Caitanya's mother, Śacīdevī, is sitting underneath a tree, animtree. It is callednimtree. And the little child on her lap and the visitors, so many visitors are coming, and they are offering some presentation. Somebody is offering gold necklace, somebody offering some bangles, some cloth, some money, and his father, he...what is called...JagannāthaMiśra.JagannāthaMiśrais there? Yes.JagannāthaMiśra, His father. He was, whatever money and clothes and gold and silver, they were coming, he was also distributing to poor men, some dancers. In India there is a system... What you call the eunuchs? Those who are neither male or female. What do you call? What is their name?"
Hayagrīva,"A combination of both, male and female? A hermaphrodite. A hermaphrodite.",Prabhupāda,"Eunuch, what is that eunuch?"
Hayagrīva,A eunuch is...,Prabhupāda,Feminine.
Hayagrīva,"Impotent, an impotent... Someone who's been castrated.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, that is called eunuch. By nature, neither man, neither woman."
Hayagrīva,"Oh, this is also called asexual, that is to say no sex.",Prabhupāda,No sex.
Hayagrīva,Hermaphroditic means they have the physical features of both man and woman.,Prabhupāda,Oh. At the same time?
Hayagrīva,At the same time.,Prabhupāda,"I do not exactly. But such people they have their own society and their means of living is that whenever there is some good occasion, a marriage or childbirth, like that, so they go there and pray God that this child may be very long living. In this way they make some prayer and get some..."
Hayagrīva,"These people... Now I don't understand... This takes place at..., the sixth scene...?",Prabhupāda,AtJagannāthaMiśra's house.
Hayagrīva,JagannāthaMiśra's house. And his wife is who?,Prabhupāda,This scene should be mentioned asJagannāthaMiśra's courtyard.
Hayagrīva,And who is his wife again?,Prabhupāda,Śacīdevī.
Hayagrīva,"Śacīdevī, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Śacīdevī is the mother of LordCaitanya. She is sitting with the child and everyone is visiting, visiting, presenting, or all, everyone's saying, ""Oh, how nice child He is."""
Hayagrīva,And these asexual people...,Prabhupāda,They are dancing.
Hayagrīva,They are dancing.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. They are dancing,HareKṛṣṇa. Yes, like that. SoHareKṛṣṇadancing is going there?"
Hayagrīva,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"And visitors coming and presenting. That is a very nice scene. Yes. The sixth scene is LordCaitanya, a naughty boy. He would go to the Ganges side and it is the system of orthodoxbrāhmaṇasthat they meditate in the Ganges, half. That is the system. Now He will go and swim over the water and throw water in their mouth in this way. Naughty boy. And they will be very much disgusted. ""You naughty boy! You come here!"" ""Stop your meditation. What is this meditation? Chant! ChantHareKṛṣṇa!"" He'll say like that. So they will come and complain to His father. ""Your child has become too much naughty and just see that..., teased us like this."" The father will say, ""Oh, the boy is going to be very naughty. I'll punish Him. Let Him come."" So father, angry father was waiting. As soon as the boy will come he would punish. But when the boy returns the father sees that He's just coming from school. There is no sign that He has gone to Ganges and taken bath. How is that these gentlemen complained? He will be puzzled. In that way, we have to show."
Hayagrīva,"How old is He here? How old isCaitanyahere? Maybe five, six?",Prabhupāda,"That was, He was five or six years old. That's all."
Hayagrīva,And this is... What's the location again?,Prabhupāda,This location is front ofJagannāthaMiśra's house.
Hayagrīva,Yes. Six years later in other words.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,All right. That's the... Does He meet any of these characters at the river? Does He meet any of the characters up there?,Prabhupāda,"No. General public. General public. But they are allbrāhmaṇas,rigidbrāhmaṇas.They are taking bath. Yes."
Hayagrīva,Now is that the end of the first act?,Prabhupāda,"End of the first... I think you should first of all write this, then you take. Or you take all the notes at a time?"
Hayagrīva,Do you feel like going on? I don't think I'm going to write these now. I'm just going to use this tape. When I go over a scene I'll just play it back. It's too much to write.,Prabhupāda,All right. That's all right.
Hayagrīva,"If you feel like going on, then go ahead.",Prabhupāda,"No, I can talk."
Hayagrīva,"Oh, good.",Prabhupāda,I can talk.
Hayagrīva,Well let's do as much as possible because you're leaving Sunday.,Prabhupāda,All right. All right. Do it.
Hayagrīva,This is second act now.,Prabhupāda,"Second act. Then Lord Caitanya'ssaṅkīrtanaorganization in the house of Śrīnivāsa. Śrīnivāsācārya. Thesaṅkīrtanamovement was... They were all chanting togetherHareKṛṣṇa, andCaitanyaMahāprabhuasked the devotees that ""Hello, My dear friends. What do you want to eat?"" So some of them said... That was out of season, and still some of them asked that ""We shall be very glad if You give us some mangoes."" (laughs) So LordCaitanyasaid that ""All right. You just bring one seed of mango."" So in Bengal there is, seed of mango is available always because the people in the village, they eat mango and throw it in the ground, they say they come out as tree, creeper. So it is not very difficult. So he brought some creeper like that, and he sowed it, and at once it became a tree, and there was sufficient quantity of mango fruits. So all the devotees were distributed. And that mango tree remained there and they were taking mango every day. And in that scene, just try to... The next scene isbrāhmaṇas'dissatisfaction. Now some of thebrāhmaṇas..."
Hayagrīva,How old isCaitanyanow?,Prabhupāda,He was about...
Hayagrīva,Sixteen?,Prabhupāda,"Fifteen, sixteen, like that. Yes. Fifteen, sixteen. Yes, you ask me questions, any about that."
Hayagrīva,"That's Hissaṅkīrtanaorganization, that first scene.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,And from this first comes...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is the beginning of..."
Hayagrīva,A scene of Nivas...,Prabhupāda,At Śrīnivāsa's house.
Hayagrīva,Are the people mainly young people like Himself?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, they were all young."
Hayagrīva,Or are they olderbrāhmaṇas?,Prabhupāda,"Older, only these..."
Hayagrīva,"Only the three, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Haridāsa, Śrīnivāsa, andAdvaita. They were taking part. Otherwise, all, they were young friends, yes. Young boys. No girls. That is not the system in India. (laughs) Yes. Now when the second scene, mainly their movement was going on and it was becoming popular. NowCaitanyaMahāprabhupreached that simply by thesaṅkīrtanamovement everything will be fulfilled. You need not do anything. So the priest classbrāhmaṇasthey became very much dissatisfied that ""He is inviting Muhammadans and all others..."" Because according toHindusociety, except thebrāhmaṇas...Especially in those days, only thebrāhmaṇaswere considered the highest in the society, and even thekṣatriyas, vaiśyas,they all calculated to, in the group ofśūdras.SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas allowing everyone, the Muhammadans, theśūdras,the low class, the high class, thebrāhmaṇas...He was amalgamating everyone. So thesebrāhmaṇas,they took objection. ""He is making a disastrous movement! The prestige of thebrāhmaṇaswill go."" So they became very much dissatisfied and they concluded that ""We shall go to the magistrate and file our complaint that He is doing againstHindureligion and He's crying always 'HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa' loudly. The Lord is sleeping. He will be disturbed and there will be disaster, Lord being angry."" In this way they filed complaint. Ask anything, questions."
Hayagrīva,Are there any of the characters listed up here among thebrāhmaṇaswho complained?,Prabhupāda,No. They complained... Characters... Ordinarybrāhmaṇas.
Hayagrīva,"Yes. All right. I can't think of anything there. That leads into the next scene, third scene.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Then the next scene is that some constables came and during theHari-saṅkīrtana,they broke themṛdaṅgasthat ""You have disobeyed the magistrate order that... So you cannot do it."" So as the constables, they do some violence or assault, so they did that. And after the constables went awayCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas informed. He came. He saw that themṛdaṅgasare broken and everything is strewn away soCaitanyaMahāprabhusaw. He decided, ""All right. Now we shall organize a civil disobedience movement. Now tomorrow we shall organize thousands and thousands of people withmṛdaṅgasand we shall approach the magistrate house."" So He... Next scene... What is that next scene?"
Hayagrīva,Now the constables broke up asaṅkīrtanacarried on by Caitanya's friends. Any location here particular?,Prabhupāda,Yes. It is called the Śrīvāsa house.
Hayagrīva,On a house. At someone's home.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Because in India the village houses they have got some compound. Not that only fixed house. Every house has got a compound.
Hayagrīva,"All right. Very good. Now the fourth scene, this is the meeting with the magistrate.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Fourth scene. That...
Hayagrīva,They march to the magistrate.,Prabhupāda,"Magistrate house and in the courtyard all the people, they were very much enthusiastic."
Hayagrīva,Several thousand.,Prabhupāda,"Several thousand. And they were loudly chanting and meeting Lord... So when the chanting was going on the Chand Kazi appeared and there was discussion between... Chand Kazi was also very great scholar, and LordCaitanyawas also scholar. So Chand Kazi, just to pacify them, he addressedCaitanya, ""My dear boy, You happen to be my nephew. You are my sister's son. Why You are so angry upon Your maternal uncle?""CaitanyaMahāprabhugot the clue that he was prepared to make compromise. So He also mildly replied, ""Yes, you are My uncle, I know. So because you are My uncle, therefore I have come to your house. How is that when the nephew comes that you do not receive Him? In an angry mood you go upstairs?"" So in this way, the situation was pacified. Then theysattogether and there was a very learned discussion between the two. Because Hindus are always against cow killing. So he was Muhammadan. They were killing cow."
Hayagrīva,Chand...,Prabhupāda,Chand Kazi.
Hayagrīva,Muhammadan.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Muhammadan. Chand Kazi was a... Maulana Chand Kazi. His name is Maulana Chand Kazi. He was a great scholar in theKoranscripture. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhufirst of all asked the Chand Kazi, ""My dear uncle, what is your religion that you are eating your mother and father?"" (laughs) So he could understand that He was attacking the cow killing process. So he said, ""Well, You are just trying to criticize our cow killing, but in Your Vedic literature also I have seen that cow killing is allowed in sacrifice."" Then LordCaitanyasaid, ""Yes. That is not killing. That is rejuvenating. That is not killing."" The sacrifice of cow recommended in the Vedicśāstrameans that thebrāhmaṇasprove how powerful was Vedicmantrathat it could give a new life to the old cows and bulls. So thenCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, that ""Such kind of learnedbrāhmaṇasand Vedicyaj&#241ais not possible in this age. Therefore cow killing..."" Not cow killing. ""Sacrifice by offering cow, sacrifice by offering horse, and...""Aśvamedhaṁgavālambhaṁ[Cc.Ādi17.164].Andsannyāsaṁpalapaitṛkam.Sannyāsameans to become in the renounced order of life. And these five things. One thing is sacrifice by offering cow. Second, sacrifice by offering horse. Third, to accept renounced order of life. And fourth, offering ablutions... Or what is called? Offering some, something to the forefathers? What is called?"
Hayagrīva,Oblations.,Prabhupāda,"Oblations. Yes. This, and to beget child by the husband's younger brother. Formerly, the society allowed that if a woman is young, she has no child, but husband died, so if the husband has younger brother, through the younger brother she could have a child. This system was current. ButCaitanyaMahāprabhusays that these five things are forbidden in this age. So Chand Kazi also replied that ""Cow killing is also not generally recommended in theKoran.Actually, beef-eating or flesh-eating is not in the higher stage. But those who are inclined to take flesh, for them it is recommended that instead of killing many small animals, one big animal should be killed. So actually in Mecca, Medina, they kill camel. That is also in the mosque."" So the substance of his speech was that flesh-eating ultimately is not recommended. ""But those who have no other means, they eat flesh and they recommend that one big animal should be killed. So India, the cow is big animal, therefore we kill. But that is not recommended for advanced spiritual students."" In this way... So they were friends, and he understood, Chand Kazi understood that it is very nice movement, that ""You are preaching love of Godhead. So I did not understand. So my dear boy, henceforward there will be no hindrances in Your movement and I promise that not only myself but all my descendants will never object Your movement, thissaṅkīrtanamovement."""
Hayagrīva,"All right. Now I don't have any questions there. I probably wouldn't deal quite at such length about the meat. I don't see how that... The main thing was about thesaṅkīrtana,the chanting.",Prabhupāda,"Chanting, and it was mitigated, and he allowed. First of all, there was objection, then there was civil disobedience, then when they compromised, the Chand Kazi allowed the movement. This is the whole idea."
Hayagrīva,The fifth scene is renunciation of household life.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,This is at age...? This is considerably later then. This is about ten years later.,Prabhupāda,"No. Renunciation... Now this Chand Kazi, he was... This movement when He was about 20 years old. Do you follow?"
Hayagrīva,Thesaṅkīrtanawas when He was around 20. The Kazi.,Prabhupāda,Thesaṅkīrtanawas going on.
Hayagrīva,"When He was 16, 15.",Prabhupāda,"But practically He started thissaṅkīrtanamovement vigorously from the age of 15 years. But when He was 20 years old, when the movement took very nice appearance, thebrāhmaṇascomplained. So this movement was about 20 years old when... Then renunciation..."
Hayagrīva,He's 24 now.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Renunciation. So one day it so happened that instead of chantingHareKṛṣṇa, LordCaitanyawas chanting,""Gopī,gopī,gopī,gopī,gopī,""instead of chanting ""KṛṣṇaKṛṣṇa."" So He had a small school. Thebrāhmaṇas,generally they keep a small school which is calledcatuṣpaṭhī.(spells out) C-c-h-a-a-t-u-s-p-a-t-h-i.Catuṣpaṭhī,catuṣpaṭhīmeans a school where up to the fourVedasare taught. Grammar and religion and everything is taught there. In every village that was system. Thebrāhmaṇasshould keep up a school like that. Students were all almost they were also of the same age. Some of them were fifteen years old, sixteen years old. So students came and saw LordCaitanyawas chanting""Gopīgopī,""so they objected. They said, ""Oh, why You are chanting'gopī gopī'?Why should You not chant 'Kṛṣṇa'? 'Hare Kṛṣṇa'?"" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas in His ecstasy because He was... In the beginning, His appearance is in the form ofgopī,to loveKṛṣṇa. So He became very much angry, and because they were students, He wanted to chastise them. He took a stick. ""You nonsense! What you are speaking? Go away!"" So they fled away, but after that they organized. ""Oh, how is that?Caitanya, He is... How He has become so big that He wants to beat us?"" In this way they practically they were talking ill of Him. So He decided that ""If I remain a householder, these people will not honor Me."" Because in those days asannyāsīwas honored in the society very much. If asannyāsīcomes to your village or to a householder's house it was very... Still it is going on, although not so widely. But still 80% of the population in India, if they find out asannyāsīthey give all honor. So He decided that ""Now I shall become asannyāsī.""So He happened to seeKeśavaBhāratī, asannyāsīof the Śaṅkarasampradāya,and He requested him that ""You give Mesannyāsa.""So He tooksannyāsafromKeśavaBhāratīand He was assisted byNityānanda,MurāriGupta, and some other people. So this is His renunciation decision and acceptance ofsannyāsa."
Hayagrīva,"How does He, How does He acceptsannyāsī?I mean how does He...?",Prabhupāda,"Sannyāsa,there is a ceremony. Just like we have got the initiation ceremony."
Hayagrīva,Did He have a spiritual master?,Prabhupāda,"So He accepted spiritual... Not spiritual master, but asannyāsa-guru.That is also master, but he's not spiritual master. But he's also considered assannyāsa-guru,spiritual master who offers himsannyāsa.Just like myself, I took initiation from myGuruMaharaja, but I tooksannyāsafrom a Godbrother who is asannyāsī.So my originalguruis that spiritual master who initiated me, but he's also aśikṣāguru.Like that. Teacher. Then His renunciation of householder. He becamesannyāsa.Now when He was, after takingsannyāsa,when He was going towardsVṛndāvana, He became always almostmad. SoNityānanda, He was with Him. When He saw that LordCaitanyais in ecstasy, He misled Him just to... His plan was that ""I shall take LordCaitanyato the house ofAdvaita, and then I shall call His mother to see Him for the last time. IfCaitanyagoes away from this very point His mother will not be able to see Him."" So out of sympathy He said, ""Well, ŚrīpādaCaitanya, this is not, this side is notVṛndāvana. You go..."" He just misdirected Him. So... And He sent one man toAdvaitato receive Him that ""He has takensannyāsī,just try to make arrangement to receive Him. Then we shall meet."" So when He came near the house ofAdvaitaHe saw thatAdvaitawas waiting. So then He, I mean to say, came to His sense. ""Oh, I am misled? I have come to Advaita's house? How is thatNityānanda? You showed Me this wayVṛndāvana."" Then He said, ""Oh, wherever You stay, that isVṛndāvana."" NowAdvaitasays, ""All right, please come to my house."" So he received Him and took Him there and sent news to His mother that ""Your son has now takensannyāsa.Now if you want to see Him for the last time please come and see."" So in this way at Advaita's house He remained for some time. Say about a fortnight. And during that time, in the beginning, His mother came and His mother became so much sorry. That scene you have to describe very nicely. Mother seeing that her son has takensannyāsa,no more He'll come to house. So (s)he was crying. AndCaitanyaMahāprabhufell on his(her) feet and begged, ""My dear mother, yes. This body belongs to you. This body should have been engaged for your service. Unfortunately I've done a mistake. I have already takensannyāsa.Please excuse Me."" In this way. That scene described in the Dilip Kumar's house, thatCaitanyais consulting mother, that is a false scene. The actual scene is that after accepting Hissannyāsa,His mother came to see Him at Advaita's house. That is the..."
Hayagrīva,Yes. Does she give Him her blessing finally?,Prabhupāda,"No. Of course, mother's blessings are always there. But the scene was that mother was crying and He was falling on the feet and His mother was very sorry that He had very beautiful hair. Now it is all cut off. In this way, the scene is very pathetic. So in this way, after remaining at Advaita's house, His mother was asking Him throughAdvaita, ""Let Him remain for some time."" Then He consulted ""Mother, now just you think over that I have takensannyāsa.And if I remain in this way, leaving My own family, and if I leave another family, do you think this is very nice for asannyāsī?So give Me permission to go away."" Then mother agreed and other friends likeAdvaitaand Śrīnivāsa requested His mother that ""You give Him permission."" Then (s)he said, ""Yes, I have to give Him permission because He has already acceptsannyāsa.If somebody blames Him, blasphemy, that is also not good. So my last request is that He may make His headquarter atJagannāthaPurīso that... Because people generally go toJagannāthaPurī, so I shall be able at least to know about Him, how He is faring there. That is my last request."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuat once accepted. ""My dear mother, I shall always stay inJagannāthaPurī, and sometimes I may come to Bengal also to take bath in the Ganges. So there will be meeting. Now let Me go."" So in this way they departed andCaitanyaMahāprabhufor the last time saw His friends and mother."
Hayagrīva,"I don't understand Nityānanda's motive. He's a friend.Nityānanda, He's a young friend of... Caitanya's.",Prabhupāda,"Oh,Nityānandawas not actually a family brother. But He was, He is the incarnation ofBaladeva, the elder brother ofKṛṣṇa. So He took His birth in a different family, but He joined Caitanya's movement as other friends joined. So He is considered the elder brother ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu. He's actually."
Hayagrīva,He opposed Caitanya'ssannyāsa.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. He did not oppose. He did not oppose. He simply, after Caitanya's acceptance ofsannyāsa,He wanted simply that He should come to Advaita's place so that His mother may see Him for the last time. That was His plan."
Hayagrīva,"All right, this is third act, first scene.",Prabhupāda,"SoCaitanyaMahāprabhu, after taking leave from His mother, left Bengal towards Orissa, and on the entrance of the district of Balasore there is a nice temple calledKṣīra-corā-gopīnāthatemple. And He saw the temple. Here the scene is to be arranged that there is nice temple and within the temple there isRādhā-KṛṣṇaDeity,Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha.Thepūjārīsare there,āratiis being taken place, and at that timeCaitanyaMahāprabhuentered with His followers chantingHareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa, and He saw the Deity and danced before Him. And when theāratiwas finished, prayer was finished, then Hesatdown, talked with His associates,NityānandaandGadādharaandMurāri. SoNityānandaPrabhudescribed about theKṣīra-corā-gopīnātha,the story ofKṣīra-corā-gopīnātha.It was very nice story, that formerly oneācārya,MadhavendraPurīcame to this temple,Gopīnatha, and while that condensed milk which is calledkṣīrawas being offered to the Deity,MadhavendraPurīwanted to taste it so that he would also prepare such condensed milk and offer to hisGopāla.So after that he thought, ""Oh, it is being offered toKṛṣṇaand I wanted to taste it. So I am so greedy."" So he left the temple, that ""I am not worth to visit this temple."" He went outside the temple andsatdown underneath a tree and was chantingHareKṛṣṇa. Then at dead of night,Gopīnatha,the Deity, was awakening His priest by dream, that ""You please get up. I have kept one pot of condensed milk behind My..."" What is called... That (pid?)vastra,kings, sometimes they have got, very long tail-like. What is that called?"
Hayagrīva,Robe or something?,Prabhupāda,Yes. What is the name?
Hayagrīva,I don't know.,Prabhupāda,"In Sanskrit it is called (pid?)vastra,backside robe. So under the backside robe He kept one pot of condensed milk by stealing. So thepūjārīwoke up and opened the door and actually saw that there was a pot of condensed milk. The priests were very much astonished that ""Oh, He has stolen (laughs)kṣīrafor His devotee."" So the order was that ""You take this pot and give toMadhavendraPurī. He is sitting underneath a tree."" So they, with the pot of the condensed milk, they began to cry, ""Oh, who is thatMadhavendraPurī? Oh, you are so fortunate. The Deity has stolen condensed milk for you. Take it."" So he came forward and he was so pleased that Lord has stolen. ""Because I desired to taste so Lord has stolen one pot."" So in this way. From that day He became famous, the thief of condensed milk,Kṣīra-corā.Kṣīrameans condensed milk andcorāmeans thief. So the temple became famous as the temple of the thief of condensed milk."
Hayagrīva,"Caitanya, the condensed milk thief.",Prabhupāda,"No. Oh, you did not hear.Caitanya, after seeing the Deity, He was sitting and seeing and meantimeNityānandaPrabhunarrated the story how His name becameKṣīra-corā-gopīnātha.You did not follow me?"
Hayagrīva,Nityānanda?,Prabhupāda,Nityānandawas going with LordCaitanya.
Hayagrīva,Narrated this to LordCaitanya?Nityānandanarrated this to LordCaitanya.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, how the Deity was known asKṣīra-corā-gopīnātha.The story was narrated that formerly He stole one..."
Hayagrīva,Condensed milk.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Pot of condensed milk for His devotee.
Hayagrīva,Now what direct relationship does this have to LordCaitanya?,Prabhupāda,"LordCaitanyaalso visited. Anyone in those days going toJagannāthaPurīfrom Bengal they had to pass that way. And on the way theKṣīra-corā-gopīnāthatemple is there. So everyone used to visit. So formerlyMadhavendraPurī, he also visited, and for him the Deity stole the condensed milk. From that time He's known asKṣīra-corā-gopīnātha.That story was narrated toCaitanyaMahāprabhu. So while sitting before the Deity, the story was narrated andCaitanyaMahāprabhurelished it that God is so kind that sometimes He steals for His devotee. This is the significance of this. So here the scene should be arranged that very nice temple, the Deity within, and LordCaitanyaentered while chantingHareKṛṣṇaand saw the worship,ārātrika.These things are to be shown in this scene. And a little story about Him, that's all."
Hayagrīva,About the temple.,Prabhupāda,About the temple. This will finish the first scene.
Hayagrīva,There should be more to the scene I think than that.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Arrangement of the scene, yes. A very nice temple."
Hayagrīva,We might be able to... Now what is this second scene? This is another temple.,Prabhupāda,"This is another temple, yes. Here also, this temple,Sākṣi-gopāla."
Hayagrīva,I might be able to combine these if they...,Prabhupāda,"No. They are different temples. So LordCaitanyais visiting different temples, that you have to show. And each temple, the significance of the temple has to be described. Especially the Deity. When the importance is to the Deity, the Deity should be shown nicely decorated. (end of first tape)"
Hayagrīva,Well I don't know if I have enough information for that first scene. But I'll think of something ... I don't know if I have enough information for the first scene. It can be very short.,Prabhupāda,"First scene, why you have to... Theārātrikais going on andkīrtanais going on, you can continue for five minutes, ten minutes thekīrtana,and short description of the Deity. That's all. That will finish."
Hayagrīva,Now the other is theSākṣi-gopāla.,Prabhupāda,"Sākṣi-gopāla.Sākṣimeans witness.Gopāla.That picture, we have brought that big picture, that isGopālamūrti.Alone standingKṛṣṇaand playing... You have seen that big picture?"
Hayagrīva,"The big picture, yes.",Prabhupāda,"A Deity like that should be situated in that temple. And His name isSākṣi-gopāla.Similarly LordCaitanyaentered with His party and saw theārātrikainGopālatemple. Then the story of theGopāla,Sākṣi,why He was known asSākṣi-gopāla."
Hayagrīva,Saw what? Darate. Saw what? He saw...,Prabhupāda,Ārati.
Hayagrīva,Entered and saw in theSākṣitemple and saw...? What did you say?,Prabhupāda,"Sākṣi-gopālameans witnessGopāla.So how He became witness, that story was also narrated byNityānandatoCaitanyaMahāprabhu. That story is that in that village, twobrāhmaṇas...That's a very long story."
Hayagrīva,What does this have to do with this temple? What does this story have to do with the temple? LordCaitanyahas entered this temple.,Prabhupāda,"That's all. But how this temple was established, howGopālawas established, that history is in that story. TheSākṣi-gopālameans witness. ThisGopālawas situated inVṛndāvana, but to give witness for His devotee He came to Orissa, that place. That is the significance of thisGopāla.Do you follow?"
Hayagrīva,No. (laughs) No.,Prabhupāda,"ThisGopālawas situated atVṛndāvana.Vṛndāvanameans about more than one thousand miles away from where the temple is situated now. But He came one thousand miles to give witness for His devotee. Since then,Gopālais situated there. So that story is narrated. That story should be narrated or what? How to do it? That is the significance of the temple. There was some family quarrel andGopālacame to give witness to decide judgement on that quarrel. So it is possible to describe?"
Hayagrīva,"I think from a dramatic point of view, that in your third act, you can't have too many narrations. It becomes very tedious. If you have a narration. Someone telling the history of various temples. Like in the first scene, now there's a story being told LordCaitanyabyNityānanda. Now in the second scene He visits another temple. And is there going to be another narration about how the temple was founded? I don't think that's... I don't know. (laughs) Do you think that will be all right?",Prabhupāda,"No. That will be all right in this way, that the narration should be shortly described in poetry and that will be chanted withkīrtana.In that way, you see."
Hayagrīva,"Yes. You see the first two acts there was a lot of action. Now we're in the third act and we have two scenes of description. Now they can be two short scenes of description. That will be all right, I think.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,So what is the story? A short little story?,Prabhupāda,"The short story is that there was twobrāhmaṇas.Twobrāhmaṇas.One youngbrāhmaṇa,one oldbrāhmaṇa.They went toVṛndāvanato seeGopāla,and the oldbrāhmaṇawas so obliged to the youngbrāhmaṇa,he promised to hand over his youngest daughter to the youngbrāhmaṇa.But when he came back home his eldest son objected. So he kept mum. Then when the youngbrāhmaṇa,I mean to say, reminded him that ""You promised beforeGopālato hand over your daughter. Now you are silent. What is this?"" So his eldest son said, ""Well, ifGopālacomes to give witness that my father promised before Him then my sister can be married with you."" So he went back toVṛndāvanaand requestedGopālato come and give witness. So He came and the marriage ceremony was performed. This is the sum and substance of the story. And since thenGopāladid not...Gopālameans statue. So in those days there was no transport service. And whenGopālawas present everyone became struck with wonder that ""Oh, such a devotee thatGopālahas come fromVṛndāvanato Orissa, more than 1,500 miles."" So the king of that place constructed a very nice temple and since then that temple is known as witnessGopāla.Sākṣi-gopālameans witness. So this story can be shortly described and chanted with music and the scene of the temple will be seen,CaitanyaMahāprabhudancing. Our real purpose will be the dancing and singing and little description."
Hayagrīva,"Yes. Now, is that all of this?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Then He visitedJagannāthatemple. And theJagannāthatemple you have to arrange, it is very crowded temple. So many people were visitingJagannāthatemple, at the same time LordCaitanyaalso entered, and He entered alone."
Hayagrīva,How old is He at this point?,Prabhupāda,CaitanyaMahāprabhu?
Hayagrīva,His age at this time?,Prabhupāda,"Twenty-four years. It is just after Hissannyāsa.He tooksannyāsaat the age of twenty-four. So He's visiting. AftersannyāsaHe's going toJagannāthaPurī. On the way He visited thisKṣīra-corā-gopīnātha,Sākṣi-gopāla,and ultimately He came toJagannāthatemple. And in theJagannāthatemple was very crowded temple because it is always at least 500, 1,000 devotees are always seeing. It is significance ofJagannāthatemple. So He entered and as soon as He sawJagannāthaHe became overwhelmed with ecstasy and fell down unconscious. So all the people gathered, ""He's a youngsannyāsī.He has fallen down."" So there wasSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya, the learned scholar ofPurī. He saw, ""Oh, this youngsannyāsī,He's not ordinary."" So he asked his men to carry Him to his place and that will be the scene. Then after His departure His followers will come, and they will search in the temple thatCaitanyaMahāprabhuis not there. Then oneGopīnāthaĀcārya, I think the character is there?GopīnāthaĀcārya?"
Hayagrīva,Now is this the...,Prabhupāda,"Yes,GopīnāthaĀcārya."
Hayagrīva,Is this the learnedbrāhmaṇa?,Prabhupāda,GopīnāthaĀcārya andSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya. They were brother-in-law.
Hayagrīva,Saba...Be...,Prabhupāda,Bhauma.
Hayagrīva,"Oh, his name is here. Yes, you didn't mention...",Prabhupāda,AndGopīnāthaĀcārya is also there.
Hayagrīva,"Yes, all right. Sarvabhooma.",Prabhupāda,"So just note down. First of all,CaitanyaMahāprabhuenters the temple. As soon as He seesJagannāthaHe becomes fainted and fell down unconscious. So all the visitors, they became astonished that here is a youngsannyāsīand how is that He has fallen down? ButSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryanoted that He is a high-gradesannyāsī.So he asked his men that ""You carry this body, unconscious body to my place."" So his men took awayCaitanyaMahāprabhu's body unconscious, andSārvabhaumaalso and exit. Then after their departure His party entered the temple.Nityānanda,Gadādhara, andMurāri, all these men entered. SoGopīnāthaĀcārya was present there. He was known toGadādharaandGadādharainquired that is there anysannyāsīwho came here? ThenGopīnāthaĀcārya said, ""Yes, we have seen onesannyāsī.He fell down in ecstasy andSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryahas taken Him to his home."" So he invited, ""All right, you come with me. I am taking you there."" So all the parties were taken toSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya's place."
Hayagrīva,The friends ofCaitanya. What are their names again?,Prabhupāda,"Their name isNityānanda,Gadādhara..."
Hayagrīva,What's that name?,Prabhupāda,Gadādhara.
Hayagrīva,"Oh I see, yes. AndMurāri.",Prabhupāda,AndMurāriandMukunda. AndHaridāsaalso. Yes.
Hayagrīva,AndHaridāsa. What aboutAdvaita?,Prabhupāda,"No,Advaitaand Śrīnivāsa, they were left in..."
Hayagrīva,All right. They're not there.,Prabhupāda,The next scene comes to theSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya's place.
Hayagrīva,Fourth scene.,Prabhupāda,Fourth scene. Yes. LordCaitanyameetsSārvabhauma. Now fromJagannāthatemple the next scene isSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya's house. Do you follow?
Hayagrīva,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"In that house,Caitanya, LordCaitanyawas lying unconscious in ecstasy, the same unconsciousness which He got from the temple. SoSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryawas trying to treat Him with some water so that He may come to consciousness. Now when His other friends,Nityānanda,Gadādharaand others arrived there, they told, ""Oh, LordCaitanya, He becomes unconscious while chanting. So He cannot be revived to His consciousness by any other means. We have to chant."" So in theSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya's house that chanting and dancing began with all the members, and graduallyCaitanyaMahāprabhucame to consciousness. Then there was introduction ofCaitanyaMahāprabhuthroughGopīnāthaĀcārya andGadādhara. AndSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryatold that ""You become my guest, you, all of you."" And he gave them places. Then...CaitanyaMahāprabhuwas only twenty-four years old, andSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya, he was old man, about sixty years old. So by acquaintance it was disclosed that Sārvabhauma's father andCaitanyaMahāprabhu's grandfather were class friends. SoJagannāthaMiśrain that sense...JagannāthaMiśrameans Caitanya's father, was a relative, brother-in-law ofSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya. So he took Him affectionately and told Him, ""My dear boy, You have takensannyāsaat a very early age. So You should be very careful to studyVedānta-sūtrafrom me. Otherwise it will be very much difficult for You, young man."" So He agreed, ""Yes, you are just like My father. So you will kindly give Me instruction onVedānta-sūtra.""So there was discussion of theVedānta-sūtrabetweenSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryaandCaitanyaMahāprabhu. That discussion is shortly mentioned in the introduction of mySrimad-Bhāgavatam.You will see."
Hayagrīva,The discussion between Sarvabhooma?,Prabhupāda,AndCaitanya.
Hayagrīva,"AndCaitanya, regarding...",Prabhupāda,RegardingVedānta-sūtra.
Hayagrīva,"That's in the introduction toSrimad-Bhāgavatam.Yes, I remember that. All right. There's no sense in going over that. All right. What is the outcome of this now? Final outcome?",Prabhupāda,"The outcome is thatSārvabhaumawas impersonalist andCaitanyaMahāprabhuwasVaisnava. Then by argument, logic, and everything, that is shortly described here,SārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryabecame a disciple of LordCaitanyaMahāprabhu, and he became a great devotee. That is the outcome. And it was a great victory on the part ofCaitanyaMahāprabhubecauseSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryawas known as the most stubborn scholar of logic of that time and he became a devotee. BySārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya's becoming a devotee of LordCaitanya, practically He became victorious in His missionary activities becauseSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryawas the learned scholar in the assembly of the King of Orissa. So the King of Orissa also became a devotee. And many other scholars and big men."
Hayagrīva,Of Caitanya's. They all became devo...the King of Orissa?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, he became a great devotee."
Hayagrīva,That might even be mentioned in this scene. I don't know if you can mention it here.,Prabhupāda,"It is not mentioned, but..."
Hayagrīva,"Well, that's an outcome of this meeting anyway.",Prabhupāda,"WhenSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryawas meeting the King, the King inquired that ""I have heard that there is a bigsannyāsīhas come here. What is the details of thesannyāsī?I've heard that you have also become a disciple."" SoSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryaexplained, ""Yes, He's not ordinarysannyāsī.He'sKṛṣṇaHimself so far I've studied."" SoBhaṭṭācārya, he was authority, a great learned man. And the King, when he heard that He isKṛṣṇa, he also became a devotee. So all expenditure, all everything was supplied by the King and his officers toCaitanyaMahāprabhu. So many people... Always four hundred, five hundred men were visiting Him. So whoever would come he would supply food and place. AndCaitanyaMahāprabhu, He began His chanting ofHareKṛṣṇain theJagannāthatemple. The same scene is being performed here before theJagannāthatemple, LordCaitanyais dancing. When we perform the class I remembered that scene. Yes. ThatCaitanyaMahāprabhuis dancing beforeJagannātha. Every evening four parties. In each party fourmṛdaṅgaand eightkaratālas.So one party this side, one party this side, one party back side, one party front side, andCaitanyaMahāprabhuin the middle would dance and the four parties will chantHareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇa... That was going on every evening so long He stayed atJagannāthaPurī."
Hayagrīva,That only happened as long as He stayed there. Is that right?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,This no longer...they no longer do this.,Prabhupāda,"No, not in that way, butkīrtanagoes on in the temple still."
Hayagrīva,Not to such an extent.,Prabhupāda,"Sometimes to such an extent. But He was different personality. In His presence, that was a different thing. ButCaitanyaMahāprabhu's, I mean to say, Deity, is within the temple. That Deity is worshiped andkīrtanatakes place,Bhāgavata...(?)"
Hayagrīva,InJagannātha.,Prabhupāda,"InJagannāthaPurī, yes."
Hayagrīva,All right. Now is that all of the fourth scene? Anything else in the fourth scene?,Prabhupāda,"No, nothing."
Hayagrīva,All right. Then that's the end of the third act.,Prabhupāda,It is the end of third act. [break]
Hayagrīva,"This is the fourth act, first scene.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, fourth act, first scene."
Hayagrīva,MeetsRāmānandaRāya.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Shall I speak?
Hayagrīva,Oh yes.,Prabhupāda,"So after convertingSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya,CaitanyaMahāprabhustarted for His South Indian tour. In South Indian tour, before meetingRāmānandaRāya, He visited a very nice temple which is calledVijayaNṛsiṁha. Shall I...? Shall you give that scene? That is very nice temple.Huh?"
Hayagrīva,Yes. Go ahead.,Prabhupāda,Then the first scene will be the visit ofVijayaNṛsiṁhaGarh temple.
Hayagrīva,Vijaya...,Prabhupāda,VijayaNṛsiṁhaGarh.
Hayagrīva,What do you mean He wouldn't address him because He was asannyāsī?,Prabhupāda,"Sannyāsīn,the restriction is thesannyāsīshould not beg from pound-shilling man or see them. That is a restriction. Women and men of pounds-shillings-pence."
Hayagrīva,But I thoughtRāmānandaRāyawas a devotee.,Prabhupāda,"But he was devotee, but undoubtedly, but outwardly he was a governor. Outwardly. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhudid not go him, but he understood that ""Here is a nicesannyāsī.""He came down and offered his respect andsatdown before Him. And there was acquaintances, and LordCaitanyasaid that ""Bhaṭṭācārya has already informed Me about you. You are a great devotee. So I have come to see you."" And then he replied, ""Well, what devotee? I am a pound-shilling man, politician. ButBhaṭṭācāryais very kind to me that he has asked Your Holiness to see me. So if You have come, so kindly, kindly deliver me from this materialmāyā.""So there was appointment of time withRāmānandaRāyaand both of them met again in the evening and there was discussion about, I mean to say, spiritual advancement of life. LordCaitanyainquired from him andRāmānandaRāyareplied. Of course, that's a long story, how He questioned and how he replied."
Hayagrīva,RāmānandaRāya.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,"Well, is that important? That's the scene about the meeting.",Prabhupāda,"Meeting, meeting, that discussion would you like to give?"
Hayagrīva,"Well, if it has to be rendered in the scene it's important. You want me to render the discussion?",Prabhupāda,"Important is the scene that He metRāmānandaRāya, he came in procession, that was a nice scenery. These things are already complete. Now so far the talks are concerned, the summary of the talk was..."
Hayagrīva,Just give me the brief summary.,Prabhupāda,"Brief summary... In this sceneCaitanyaMahāprabhubecame the student. Not exactly student. He inquired andRāmānandaRāyaanswered. So the importance of the scene is thatCaitanyaMahāprabhudoes not follow the formality, only thesannyāsīsshould be the spiritual master. Anyone who knows the science ofKṛṣṇa, he can be spiritual master. And to show this example practically, although He wassannyāsīandbrāhmaṇaandRāmānandaRāyawas aśūdraand agṛhastha,householder, still He became like a student and inquiredRāmānandaRāya.RāmānandaRāyafelt some, I mean to say, hesitation that ""How can I take the position of a teacher to asannyāsī?""ThenCaitanyaMahāprabhureplied, ""No, no. Don't hesitate."" He stated that either one may be asannyāsīor he may be householder or one may be abrāhmaṇaorśūdra,it doesn't matter. Anyone who knows the science ofKṛṣṇa, he can take the place of teacher. So that was His, I mean to say, gift. Because in Indian society it is simply taken that thebrāhmaṇasand thesannyāsīcan be spiritual master. ButCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""No. Anyone can become spiritual master provided he's conversant with the science."" And the summary of the discussion was how to elevate oneself in the highest perfection of love of Godhead. And that love of Godhead was described, existed, I mean to say, superexcellently in Rādhārāṇī. So in thebhāva,in the feature of Rādhārāṇī. AndRāmānandaRāya, in the feature of Rādhārāṇī's associatesLalitā-sakhī,both of them embraced and began to dance in ecstasy. That will be the end of the scene. Both of them began to dance in ecstasy."
Hayagrīva,RāmānandaRāya...,Prabhupāda,AndCaitanyaMahāprabhu.
Hayagrīva,All right. Now the second scene. Is that the end of the first?,Prabhupāda,"Second scene, fourth act,CaitanyaMahāprabhuafter finishing His South Indian tour, He came back toJagannāthaPurī, His headquarter, and after some days He started forVṛndāvana. While He was inVṛndāvanaHe was embracing the tree as old friend, and the birds were sitting on His hand, as if receiving an old friend. Because He wasKṛṣṇa. So after many years they have seen. And that scene, if you can describe how He's traveling in theVṛndāvanaforest. Then He took bath in the severalvānasandghāṭas.Ghāṭasmeans bathing place of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. And everywhere He felt the ecstasy of Rādhārāṇī, separation. In this way He returned fromVṛndāvana, and when He came down to Prayag, modern Allahabad, at that time He metRūpaGosvāmī.RūpaGosvāmī."
Hayagrīva,Now you say the trees were old friends because He could remember that He wasKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇaused to play in these forests. He used to play in the forest. Yes. Now He metRūpaGosvāmī.,Prabhupāda,At Prayag.
Hayagrīva,At Prayag. Yes.,Prabhupāda,Allahabad. And...
Hayagrīva,"What is His age? I just want to keep checking on this, His age now. Is He twenty, in His twenties still?",Prabhupāda,"No, no. He tooksannyāsaat twenty-four. Say twenty-five, twenty-six years."
Hayagrīva,Couple years later. All right. Because time is an important factor. You have to keep track of the time in the play.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. He toured, after Hissannyāsa,He toured all over India for six years only. That means up to 30th year He toured all over India. And from 30th year to 48th year, 18 years, He constantly remained atJagannāthaPurī. He used to chant in the temple and meet His visitors. Especially during car festival ceremony ofJagannātha, from Bengal about 400, 500 devotees would go and meet Him, and they would remain there for four months continually. July, August, September, October. Four months. And then they would come back. In this way, for 18 years He passed inJagannāthaPurī. SoRūpaGosvāmī, He metRūpaGosvāmī and He taught him about the science of devotion for ten days. That devotional service He instructed that the living entities they're roaming in the 8,400,000 species of life. Fortunately, if by the mercy ofKṛṣṇaand if he gets one good spiritual master, then he learns about devotional service. So He taught him about the science of devotional service. That is the importance of meetingRūpaGosvāmī. So here the scenery must be mentioned. It is on the bank of Ganges. There is a niceghāṭa,just like... You have been to Benares? No. You have been to Hardwar?"
Hayagrīva,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"You have seen manyghāṭas,bathing places."
Hayagrīva,"Oh yes, yes.",Prabhupāda,"Similarly, there areghāṭasin Benares, Prayag, and all, I mean to say,Vṛndāvana. That is the specific significance of Indian places of pilgrimage."
Hayagrīva,Yes. They bathe there every day I noticed.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So similarly, there is aghāṭawhich is called DaśāśvamedhaGhāṭaat Prayag. He instructed about the science of devotional service toRūpaGosvāmī."
Hayagrīva,Now how old isRūpaGoswami? Is he an old man?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, he was old enough. He was not less than fifty years at that time."
Hayagrīva,"I see. All right. Anything else in the second scene, fourth act?",Prabhupāda,That is it... And then He came back to Benares.
Hayagrīva,Who?,Prabhupāda,CaitanyaMahāprabhu.
Hayagrīva,I thought He stayed inJagannātha... He's not now... He left...,Prabhupāda,"No, fromJagannāthaPurīHe went toVṛndāvana. FromVṛndāvanawhile coming down again He first of all came to Prayag. There He taughtRūpaGosvāmī. Then when He still came down He came to Benares. At Benares He remained for two months. More than two months. And for two months continually He instructedSanātanaGosvāmī about devotional service. That instruction you'll find in theTeachings of LordCaitanya.I've written thatTeachings of LordCaitanya?"
Hayagrīva,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Yes. In that you'll find.
Hayagrīva,"Now this third scene, meetsSanātanaGosvāmī, that's in Benares. AndSanātanais how old?",Prabhupāda,Sanātanawas older thanRūpaGosvāmī. He was the eldest. He was not less than about 65 or 70 years old. He was old man. Sufficiently old man.
Hayagrīva,Yes. And of the instructions toSanātanaGosvāmī are in theTeachings of LordCaitanya.All right. Now...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Similarly, the fourth scene, the teachings withPrakāśānandaSarasvatī, that is also in there."
Hayagrīva,Who is this?,Prabhupāda,"PrakāśānandaSarasvatīwas at Benares. He was aMāyāvādīsannyāsī,Śaṅkarasampradāya.So he used to... This scene should be given that at Benares He was also walking all over the streets and roads, ""HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa"" and thousands and thousands men were following Him. This news arrived toPrakāśānandaSarasvatīwho was the chiefsannyāsīthere and some of the devotees told, ""Oh, a very nicesannyāsīhas come to Benares. He's chantingHareKṛṣṇa."" SoPrakāśānandaSarasvatīdeprecated, ""Oh! This is a nonsense! Why asannyāsīshould chant and dance? He should concentrate his mind in studyingVedānta. He is a fool."" In this wayCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas criticized. So one Maharastrianbrāhmaṇa,he was devotee ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu. He said that ""This incident gave us much pain, sir. If You kindly meet thissannyāsīand talk with him aboutVedānta-sūtra,that would be a nice thing."" In the meantime onebrāhmaṇacame and invited LordCaitanyathat ""I have invited all thesannyāsīnsof Benares, but I know You do not meet theseMāyāvādīsannyāsīs,but still I have come to invite You. You kindly accept my invitation."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusaw this opportunity of meetingPrakāśānandaSarasvatī. He accepted his invitation, and there was a meeting, and there was discussion ofVedānta-sūtrawithPrakāśānandaSarasvatī, and He converted him to be aVaisnava. That is another incident."
Hayagrīva,How old is this man?,Prabhupāda,PrakāśānandaSarasvatī? He was also old man. Not less than sixty years old. Yes.
Hayagrīva,And what was his role again in the town? What was he... He was a Vedantist?,Prabhupāda,"PrakāśānandaSarasvatī. He was aMāyāvādīsannyāsī.He acceptedCaitanyaMahāprabhu's principle and he offered his respect. He touched His feet. And he also joined. But there is no mention that he became officially aVaisnava, but he accepted the philosophy ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu. ButSārvabhaumaBhaṭṭācāryaofficially, he became aVaisnava. Then LordHaridāsameets..."
Hayagrīva,Fifth scene.,Prabhupāda,Fifth scene.
Hayagrīva,This isHaridāsaṬhākura?,Prabhupāda,HaridāsaṬhākura.
Hayagrīva,At who's death? At Haridāsa's death?,Prabhupāda,Yes.Haridāsawas very old man. He was Muhammadan.
Hayagrīva,He was the person that was thrown in the river.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,"So he finally met his end here, in the fifth scene.",Prabhupāda,"We are not meant for those... Of course,HaridāsaṬhākura has a separate life, but that we are not going to show."
Hayagrīva,Yes. All right. This particular incident.,Prabhupāda,"Particular incident is significant, thatCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas abrāhmaṇaand He was asannyāsī.According to social custom He should not touch even a Muhammadan, but thisHaridāsaṬhākura was a Muhammadan, and at his death He took the body Himself and danced, and He put him in the graveyard and distributedprasādam.AndHaridāsaṬhākura for two, three days he was feeling not well. Because he was Muhammadan he did not enter the temple ofJagannāthatemple. Because the Hindus were very strict. He was devotee, he never mind. Why he should create some row? SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuappreciated his behavior that he did not want to create any... Because he has become devotee. Forcibly he was not going to the temple. ButCaitanyaMahāprabhuHimself was daily coming and seeing him. While going to take bath in the sea, He'll first of all seeHaridāsa. ""Haridāsa? What you are doing?""Haridāsawill offer his respect and He will sit and talk for some time. ThenCaitanyaMahāprabhuwill go to take His bath. In this way, one day when He came He sawHaridāsanot feeling very well. ""Haridāsa? How is your health?"" ""Yes Sir, it is not very... After all, it is body."" Then the third day He saw thatHaridāsais going to leave his body today. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuasked him, ""Haridāsa, what do you desire?"" Both of them could understand.Haridāsasaid that ""This is my last stage. If You kindly stand before me."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhustood before him and he left his body. (pause)"
Hayagrīva,You mentioned that...,Prabhupāda,"After his departure the body was taken byCaitanyaMahāprabhuHimself, and other devotees took him to the seaside and dug his graveyard. That grave is still inJagannāthaPurī.HaridāsaṬhākura'ssamādhi,tomb. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhubegan to dance. That was the ceremony. Because in aVaiṣṇavaceremony, everything iskīrtanaand dance. So that was His last ceremony ofHaridāsaṬhākura."
Hayagrīva,You mentioned something aboutCaitanyadancing withHaridāsa?,Prabhupāda,Haridāsa's body.Caitanya...dead body. Haridāsa's dead body.
Hayagrīva,"Oh, with his dead body?",Prabhupāda,Yes. His dead body.
Hayagrīva,After his death.,Prabhupāda,After his death.
Hayagrīva,Caitanya...,Prabhupāda,"While, I mean to say,Haridāsawas alive, he was dancing. But after the death ofHaridāsa,CaitanyaMahāprabhuHimself took the body and began to dance withkīrtana.That means his funeral ceremony was conducted byCaitanyaMahāprabhuHimself. He took the body to the seaside and in the graveyard He..."
Hayagrīva,He conducted the...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Funeral ceremony, yes."
Hayagrīva,With akīrtana.,Prabhupāda,"Withkīrtana.Kīrtanais always there. And after burial there was distribution ofprasādamandkīrtana.HaridāsaṬhākura. So here you have to show some talks withHaridāsa, how feelingly."
Hayagrīva,All right. Are there any other... Is there any other information aboutHaridāsa?,Prabhupāda,"The life history ofHaridāsais that he was born in a Muhammadan family. Someway or other he became a devotee and was chanting 300,000 timesHareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare,HareRamaHareRamaRamaRamaHareHare, andCaitanyaMahāprabhumade himācārya,the authority of chanting. Therefore we glorify him,""NāmācāryaHaridāsaṬhākurakijaya.""Because he was made theācārya,the authority of chantingHareKṛṣṇa. Then, when LordCaitanyatooksannyāsa,HaridāsaṬhākura desired that ""My dear Lord, You are leaving Nabadwip, then what is the use of my life? Either you take me or let me die."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""No. Why shall you die? You come with Me."" So He took him toJagannāthaPurī. AtJagannāthaPurī, because he considered himself born of Muhammadan family, he did not enter. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhugave him a place atKāśīnāthaMiśra's house and there he was chanting andCaitanyaMahāprabhu's sending himprasādam.In that way he was passing his days. AndCaitanyaMahāprabhuused to come and see him daily, and one day he died like this."
Hayagrīva,All right. That's the end of the fourth act. Now the fifth act...,Prabhupāda,The fifth act...
Hayagrīva,First scene.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. This is the, in the fifth act, ecstasy. At nightCaitanyaMahāprabhuwould becomemadin separation ofKṛṣṇa. He would dash His head on the floor. Sometimes He would write with His nails and sometimes He would go away. Although the house was locked, He would go away, and sometimes He would be found amongst the cowshed ofJagannāthaPurī. Sometimes He would be seen in the seashore. One day it was so found that He fell in the ocean and some fisherman caught Him in the net. And as soon as He was in the net and the fisherman touchedCaitanyaMahāprabhu, he also began to dance,HareKṛṣṇa,HareKṛṣṇa,KṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare. And his brothers, his fellow men thought, ""Oh, he's caught ghost, haunted."" So in the meantime, His secretary,DamodaraSvarupacame to the seashore and he saw that the fisherman was dancing. Then he could understand that he must have some connection withCaitanyaMahāprabhu, (laughs) otherwise why this fisherman is dancing andHareKṛṣṇa? Then asked him, ""What has happened to you?"" He said, ""Sir, I do not know. I am a fish-catcher. Now this morning I caught one big fish, and as soon as I caught I am haunted. So I am dancing."" So Swarup Damodar, ""Where is that fish, big fish? Let me see."" So he saw in the netCaitanyaMahāprabhu. He sawCaitanyaMahāprabhu, then he told him, ""Yes. I'll chant somemantraso the ghost will go away."" So he made him some show. ""All right. Now your ghost is over."" So he took awayCaitanyaMahāprabhuand whenCaitanyaMahāprabhusaw, He told Swarup Damodar, ""Why you have brought Me in the seaside? Oh, I was seeingrāsadance ofKṛṣṇa. I was enjoying."" In this way He was always in ecstasy. And in the last stage, the same ecstasy, He enteredJagannāthatemple and He never came back. That is the end of (voice trails off)CaitanyaMahāprabhu's... So you have to arrange scenes and sounds. That's all."
Hayagrīva,"Uh, now... In ecstasy here on the seashore, I don't understand. He met this fisherman.",Prabhupāda,"No! He, at night out of His own accord, He came to the seashore and fell on the sea."
Hayagrīva,"Oh, He threw Himself in the ocean.",Prabhupāda,"In the ocean. Bay of Bengal. And the fishermen they came to catch fish. So instead of fish,CaitanyaMahāprabhu's body was in the net."
Hayagrīva,"Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda,He already dropped Himself on the sea.
Hayagrīva,He was unconscious.,Prabhupāda,Unconscious. He was rolling in the sea.
Hayagrīva,So they brought Him out and some of His friends went to find Him.,Prabhupāda,"Not all. His secretary. Because he knew thatCaitanyamust have gone somewhere. So while inquiring where isCaitanyaMahāprabhu, when he came to the seashore he saw that the fisherman was dancing. Then he could understand he is dancing withHareKṛṣṇa, that means he must have some connection withCaitanyaMahāprabhu."
Hayagrīva,Oh.,Prabhupāda,"Then when he inquired, he told him that ""I have caught this morning a big fish and since then I am dancing. I do not know. I gotmad. Perhaps I have been caught by some ghost. So I do not know."" So Swarup Damodar just to pacify him, ""Yes. I am just driving away ghoul, mean to say, ghost. Don't worry. Where is that fish? Let me see it."" And when he saw that fish was caught in the net, and it wasCaitanyaMahāprabhu."
Hayagrīva,"Now the second scene here, this is whenCaitanyaon the seashore, this is when He would walk around saying, ""Where isKṛṣṇa?"" Is that right? ""Where is Kṛṣṇa"" He would...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. He was seen on the seashore within the net after being caught by the fisherman. And when He fell on the sea, that is not seen. You can make a scene thatCaitanyaMahāprabhuis coming,HareKṛṣṇa,Hare...and fall down in the sea. Then He was caught by the net of the fisherman."
Hayagrīva,What is the second scene?,Prabhupāda,This is the second scene I have described. First scene and second scene.
Hayagrīva,The first scene also.,Prabhupāda,"They are all. First, second scene, they are all ecstasies. Yes. And the third scene similarly..."
Hayagrīva,Wait. He must be in His forties now. This is in His forties.,Prabhupāda,Yes. These ecstasies were going on daily from His age 30th to 48th year.
Hayagrīva,"38 to 48, every day.",Prabhupāda,Not 38. 30th.
Hayagrīva,30.,Prabhupāda,"30 to 48. 18 years. Sometimes He was chanting, sometimes He was falling, sometimes He was going there. That was His business all 18 years."
Hayagrīva,Every day?,Prabhupāda,"Every day. Especially at night. (Hayagrīvalaughs) Simply... The whole program was the whole day He would see the visitors. And so many visitors were coming. In the evening He'll chant and dance in the temple. And at night instead of sleeping He was doing all these... Sometimes falling in the sea, sometimes here, sometimes there. That was His business."
Hayagrīva,I see. Now this third scene.,Prabhupāda,"Third scene. In the same way, one day when He was 48 years old He entered theJagannāthatemple..."
Hayagrīva,And disappeared.,Prabhupāda,"Disappeared. His friends outside waited and waited, and He never come back. That's all."
Hayagrīva,They never knew what happened to Him. They never found...,Prabhupāda,"Yes, they knew that He wasKṛṣṇa. He has merged into the existence ofJagannātha."
Hayagrīva,He left. Took off. All right. Now no more. That's the end.,Prabhupāda,Now you write and I shall make some addition or alteration when you write. This is the synopsis and framework. Now you can proceed. (end)
