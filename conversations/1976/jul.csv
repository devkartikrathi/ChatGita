Hari,"Hari-śauri:Ten years ago if they'd have asked these questions before you came to the West, they wouldn't even have thought about going to the West. They are only asking that now because they can see in the last ten years we've been so much successful.",Prabhupāda,"They do not know what isbhakti,what isVedānta. They do not know. Simply aspiring, all after women and money, that's all. First-class rogues. I know all of them, all first-class rogues, after money and women. Beginning from Vivekananda. But they are so popular, if you say openly...Satyambruhetmabruhetsatyamapriyam(?).""You can speak truth, but don't speak which is unpalatable."" But we speak in a different way. And directly we don't speak. People will be angry. They're already fools and rascals."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:All of the others are trying to make some compromise.,Prabhupāda,"That is also bad. How we can make compromise? Here is gold, here is iron, how you can compromise? Can we accept iron as gold? All right, let us accept. (laughs) Where is the possibility?"
Hari,Hari-śauri:They don't see that clearly. They are looking at their iron and thinking it's gold.,Prabhupāda,"They are seeing... They're tested. I don't make any compromise. All my speaking is also no compromise. Here isguru, here isKṛṣṇa, here is God, here isVedānta. Real version they neglect, and they stick to the rascal's version, Śaṅkara's version,Śārīraka-bhāṣya.All over India, they are readingŚārīraka-bhāṣya."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Rāmānujācārya is very well known in India, so why don't they read his commentary?",Prabhupāda,TheyhateRāmānujācārya because he'sVaiṣṇava.
Hari,Hari-śauri:Because he doesn't allow them to speculate.,Prabhupāda,"He is very strict. He is a stubborn enemy of Śaṅkarācārya. All theVaiṣṇavaācāryas.CaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, declare it:māyāvādi-bhāṣyaśunilehayasarva-nāśa[Cc.Madhya6.169].If you hear the interpretation ofMāyāvādīs,then you are doomed. You have no hope for spiritual advancement. This is the statement.Māyāvādi-bhāṣyaśunilehayasarva-nāśa.Finished, your spiritual life is finished. You can write this also, thatCaitanyaMahāprabhu's instruction is strictly to avoid the so-called Vedantists."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:All these impersonalists, they always represent themselves as being big Vedantists. They don't know anything.",Prabhupāda,"And people, leaders of India, they are thinking, ""Where is this Vedantist?"" In foreign countries, what is their position?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Somehow or other, they seem to think that theVedāntais something better than any of the otherśāstra. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamdoesn't seem to be so popular in India asVedāntaor something like that.",Prabhupāda,"It is very popular amongst theMāyāvādapeople. You speak also... Now the so-called Vedantists they are speaking onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,distorting. Akhoyananda, Akandananda, Karpatri(?), the rascals. Because they have no subject matter to speak, they are distorting the meaning ofBhāgavata.This boy appears to be nice, this fat boy."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yes. Kīrtanānanda said he's the only local boy who has taken interest. He's from hereabouts.,Prabhupāda,"He said that ""I've wanted to see you since a long time."" So, keep friendship with... Giving themprasādam?"
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Śrīla Prabhupāda, shall I lock this up?",Prabhupāda,"Hmm. (end) (very noisy, microphone rattling) ...live? Is he finished, or if somewhere he is still living, nobody knows. You are keeping his memorial, but where is the actual person, they do not know. Suppose I have come here and all of a sudden I go away, keeping my shirt and coat. And if you worship my shirt and coat and do not take care where I have gone, is that very good intelligence?"
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:No, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,This is going on.
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:We will worshipyourshirt and coat, though.",Prabhupāda,"Lincoln, if you worship... Where is Lincoln's temple? In Paris, I saw one park, Napoleon Bonaparte. You have been there?"
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Yes, Paris.",Prabhupāda,"They identified ""Napoleon is France."" France is there, but where is Napoleon? They do not consider like this.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31].Blind man be happy that Lincoln was here, that's all. Where he is now? Or he's finished. If he's finished, why you are worshiping his shirt and coat? What is the answer? What is their answer? If he's finished, what is the use of worshiping his shirt and coat?"
Vipina,"They say that what he accomplished, although it may not be the final answer, it was a step forward, and therefore he should be worshiped.",Prabhupāda,"Then his worship must be... That means after furnishing (?) he is also finished? That is ignorance. That is not the fact. If he's finished, then what was the purpose of furnishing?(?) There are so many questions in this connection, but they cannot understand.Andhāyathāndhair upanīyamānāste'pīśa-tantryāmuru-dāmnibaddhāḥ[SB7.5.31].This is ignorance. This kind of civilization is civilization of darkness.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:It looks like the devotees are the only people who are enlightened in this dark world. By your mercy, only the devotees can actually see anything properly and understand the condition.",Prabhupāda,"In Russia, that Kruschev, he was... Now, where he has gone, nobody knows. Finished. Nobody knows."
Hari,Hari-śauri:They retired him. They gave him a small place just outside Moscow.,Prabhupāda,You know that?
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Yes, there was a story about five years after he got kicked out of office. He was just doing nothing, living by himself.",Prabhupāda,"And what he has done? Nothing, and what he has done?"
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:They want to worshipKṛṣṇa, but they don't know how.",Prabhupāda,"They don't want to worship anyone. They want to worship their senses. That's all. Sense gratification. What is dictated by the senses, they agree to worship. Servant of the senses. In the material world nobody worships nobody. Everyone serves his own senses: ""I like it."" That's all. There is a Bengali song,yokeyadilagephalakenadag botai(?). ""If it satisfies my eyes, why shall I not see? I shall see."" This is the sum-substance of...Yokeyadilagephalakenadag bhajai.(?) Everyone wants sense gratification, to be servant of the senses. If the senses want ""Do this,"" he will do it. And our movement is that we shall not hear the dictation of the senses; we shall do whatKṛṣṇasays. That is just opposite. So long I am carrying out the orders of the senses, then I am involved in this material birth, death, transmigration. Today I am running on this nice car. Next I can stand up here as a tree. Who can check it? After death you are completely under the... You are... Your life also completely under the laws of nature. So there is no discussion, no understanding, no knowledge about this.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].We have to change our body. What kind of body we are going to get, nobody knows. This life is everything. This body is everything. Very risky. They do not inquire even wherefrom this body has come. They are also coming. They are also living. They are also eating. The trees, they are also eating water."
Vipina,"Our distributors were in the airport not long ago, and they distributed a book to a man who has just recently written a book calledThe Fourth Kingdom.And he stopped off to visit our temple and talk with us because he was impressed with the devotees and the literature, and he would like to come and speak to you.",Prabhupāda,You have arranged some engagement?
Vipina,"Yes. If it's all right with you, he'll come. He's very nice, but he has some mixed-up ideas.",Prabhupāda,"Everyone has mixed-up ideas because nobody is properly trained up. Some ideas they have got, some inquiries they have got. But unless one comes to the right person, he cannot be enlightened.Tadvijñānārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet[MU1.2.12].Therefore one must approach the properguru."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Everyone has accepted the wrong authority. Everyone has accepted the wrong authority.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Because he's misled by sense gratification, so even he approaches aguru, if thegurucannot satisfy his senses, he doesn't like. Because he's under the subjugation of senses, he expects thatgurualso will satisfy his senses, then he isguru. Ifgurusays something against his sense gratification, ""Ah, he is notguru."" (laughs)Gurualso must be a person who can satisfy your senses. This is his sense gratification."
Vipina,"After he took those books home and he read them, he wrote us a letter, and he said that he thought you were a very intelligent man and would like to speak to you. So we'll see. Maybe he can hear.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, we are speaking something not of this world, but we are pointing out the defects of this world. ""This world"" means the world of sense gratification."
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Thekarmīs,they say ""What is the matter with sense gratification?"" They say they like sense gratification; it's very good.",Prabhupāda,"Very good, but if you can continue it. But you rascal, you cannot continue it. ""Very good, I am now president,"" but why you are kicked out?Huh? Now, what about the Nixon? Very good, he was president, now he's kicked out, what is his position? He doesn't think that, that ""I may be kicked out from my position at any moment. So what is the value of my sense gratification?"" He was gratifying his senses. As he liked, he was doing. But now he's kicked out, what he can do now? Why does he not think that? Take the living example. Who wants to be kicked out from the presidency? But now he's kicked out. He's living also. He's not in that position. That Kruschev, he's not in that position. Why does he not think that ""Any moment I'll be kicked out."" And what is that enforcement that kicks out?"
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Why don't they think like that, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,That is their foolishness.
Hari,Hari-śauri:That's due to too much sinful activity? Too much sinful activity that they can't think that there's some divine influence?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. There is no education, fools. They're childish. A child is playing, he's enjoying, but he does not know that he has to take education, he has to grow up, he'll become a young man. Sometimes, if he's not educated, he'll suffer. He doesn't know. He's playing. That's all. The father says ""My dear child, you read."" ""No, I like playing."" Similarly, they are childish, foolish, without any responsibility. The animals are doing like that. Ṛṣabhadeva says ""No, no, no. This life is not for this purpose.""Nāyaṁdehodeha-bhājāṁnṛlokekaṣṭānkāmānarhateviḍ-bhujāṁye[SB5.5.1].Simply for sense gratification so much trouble, like hogs and dogs, this is not life.Tapodivyaṁputrakāyenasattvam.Just practice austerity to purify your existence. Your existence is not purified. You are put in a position. If you like, that's all right, but because you are not in a purified position, you'll be kicked out at any moment.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāni.You are very proud to have your position, but nature will kick you out at any moment, but you cannot do anything.Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāhamitimanyate[Bg.3.27].He's foolish. He's thinking ""I have everything. I can remain in this presidential position as I like."" That is not the position. That is foolishness, that is childish. He does not know what is his position. But he wants position. That means there is a good position for him, but not here. That he does not know. Everyone is hankering after good position, but where is that good position, that he does not know. Everyone is hankering after water, but he is going after water in the desert. That is animalism. The animal runs after the water in the desert, and a human being, he knows, ""No, this is not water, this is reflection."" The water is there, that's a fact, but not here. That is human... It is reflection of water. Reflection water means the water is there, but it is not here. Similarly, good position is there, but not here. Here it is simply a reflection of that position. That he does not understand. Where is the actual water, wherefrom the reflection comes, that he does not know. Falsely thinking that ""Here is everything."" Very big, big scientists, they are thinking only on this planet there is life, and all planets are vacant. Too late.(?)"
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:They all think like that, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"They are such rascals. They have no common sense that this is also one of the planets, it is filled up with life and everything, and why the other planets should be vacant? If there is rock and sand, then why not other things? Here is also rock and sand and other things. But these rascals, they think there is simply rock and sand, nothing else. And they are misleading. What is the reason? This planet is filled up with life, and other planets vacant. All right, vacant. Go and colonize there. They say it is not possible. Then why do you go there? This is going on."
Vipina,Nobody wants to do the wrong thing. Nobody wants to go up...,Prabhupāda,They are doing wrong thing every moment.
Vipina,"Yes, but I mean no one works to do the wrong thing; they work to do the right thing.",Prabhupāda,"But they'll not take the right thing. If you say the right thing, they will come to beat you with shoes. Run away."
Hari,Hari-śauri:They don't have any idea what the right thing is. Everything they're doing is wrong.,Prabhupāda,"They want right thing, but they have no idea of right thing, and if you say the right thing, they will not accept it. This is their disease."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:That is more thanmāyā; that is their heart.,Prabhupāda,That is calledmāyā.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:That ismāyā.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. They are suffering, and if you give him the remedy that he'll not have to suffer, he'll not take it."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:But that rejection, that is their choice of the heart, isn't it? I mean, they have a choice to make?",Prabhupāda,"No, no. That is the same thing. Just the child is playing, but if you say ""My dear child, you please take education, otherwise you'll suffer."" ""Oh, I don't..."" Child does not like. He wants to play. That is childish, or foolish."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:He doesn't want to be educated.,Prabhupāda,"That is foolishness.Athātobrahmajijñāsā.This human life is meant for becoming educated aboutBrahman. They will not take it. They want to remain animals, eating and sleeping, this animal life. Eat nicely, sleep nicely, have sex life nicely, defend nicely, that's all. Nicely, according to the standard of the body. Here in America, to have a conveyance nicely like a car like this, but in Indian village, a bullock cart is nicely. So this nicely and that nicely, according to the body. You have got this American body, this is nicely. He has got Indian body, that is nicely. But the feeling of niceness is there and here. We are having sex in a very nice apartment, decorated and so on, so on, and a dog is having sex on the street. But the pleasure of sex life is both the same. But we are thinking this is nice. But that is not the fact. The niceness, the feelings of niceness, is there and here."
Vipina,And so much suffering.,Prabhupāda,"Simply you have to take so much trouble. That isPrahlādaMahārāja's instruction.Sukhamaindriyakaṁdaityādeha-yogenadehinām.The sense gratification, the standard of sense gratification, isdeha-yogenadehinām,according to the body. The pig is eating very nicely stool because he has got a body like that. A human being will not take that. But the pleasure of eating, either stool orrasagullā,the same."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:You gave the example of a gold pot and an iron pot and a diamond pot. A diamond pot was a demigod, and the gold pot was a human being, and the iron pot the animal. But they are thinking that the food is more palatable in a different pot. But it is still the same food.",Prabhupāda,"But they are simply interested with the pots. External.Bahir-artha-māninaḥ.Nateviduḥsvārtha-gatiṁhiviṣṇuṁdurāśayāye...[SB7.5.31]. They are thinking by changing the pot the advancement of civilization will increase. And that is going on. Just like America. You have got very big, big roads, nice cars, everything. You are changing the pot, but the eatable is the same."
Vipina,"I heard a nice example given the other day about how living entities are suffering. A black widow, male and female black widow spiders, have sex life. After the sex life the female spider consumes the male spider, eats him alive.",Prabhupāda,What's that? Spider.
Vipina,"Black widow. She will eat him after sex, kill him.",Prabhupāda,"(laughs) So we are also killing by and by, and she kills immediately. That is the difference."
Vipina,"Yes, little by little. (laughter)",Prabhupāda,"Tulasīdāsahas said that.Dinkādakinīrātkābāghinī pālak pālakrahucuse, duniya sab barakhobegaragara bhagilipusei.(?) That there is an animal who is at daytime a witch and at nighttime she's tigress. So her only business is to suck the blood. But people are somadthat everyone keeping that tigress.Duniya sab borakhegaragarabhagini.(?)Every home, there is a tigress like that."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Their best friend.,Prabhupāda,"(laughs) At daytime, witch, and nighttime, tigress. This is her picture. But people know it, and still, they keep one tigress at home.Duniya sab barakhobegaragara bhag(?)...So that lady spider and lord spider, that is everywhere. But here gradually, and they are immediately. That is the difference. The process is the same. People want to enjoy by sex, by seminal discharge, but what is this? His blood. By fifteen drops of blood, or something like that, one drop of semina is created."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Forty drops of blood, one drop of semina.",Prabhupāda,"Forty drops. Yes. So one ounce of semina discharge means forty ounce of blood sucked. This is a fact. So he is enjoying his own blood, and he's thinking ""I am enjoying."" Therefore he's compared with the camel.Śva-viḍ-varāhauṣṭrakharaiḥsaṁstutaḥpuruṣaḥpaśuḥ.Camel eats the thorny twigs, and the thorns pricks the tongue and blood comes out. So after twig is mixed with blood, it becomes tasteful, and he thinks thorn is very nice. (laughs) So thorn is not nice; nice is his blood, own blood. But he, because he's animal, he's thinking it is very nice."
Vipina,"So many people that run their life that way, they realize that ""This woman is not making me happy, she's making me work and I'm miserable and I don't like it,"" but they keep on.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Therefore he's described asmad,bhora. Bhorameansmad.Duniya sab bhorahokegaregarebhagini.(?)"
Vipina,"We're almost there, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"In the heavenly planets the woman is described that during summer they are very warm, the body is very warm, er, during summer the body is very cool of the woman, and during winter the body is very warm. That is the nature of the woman in the heavenly planets. And their breast is very, very tight and strongly built. And their youthfulness never diminishes. These are the description of the heavenly woman.Bhāgavataeverything is there.Mohinī-mūrtibegan to play on the balls, and the description of the breast is there and, what is called this portion?"
Hari,Hari-śauri:Armpit.,Prabhupāda,"Armpit. Yes. So she was playing ball one hand and one hand a bunch of hair would become, immediately she was taking care. So with this beauty Lord Śiva becomemad. As soon as one man sees the breast and this armpit of young woman, then he is finished. (laughs)"
Vipina,So what happens to us?,Prabhupāda,"It is every man that this is the position. This is the position. And so long we will be charmed with these things, he has to take birth again and again.Viṣayināṁsaṁdarśanamathayoṣitāṁca."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:I can lock it now if you like, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes, yes."
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Would you like some warm milk, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,No.
Vipina,"Cold water for you too, Prabhupāda. Cold water here if you want some.",Prabhupāda,Cold water.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:It's quiet here.,Prabhupāda,Nice.
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:There's a swimming pool here, Prabhupāda. You have a garden by the pool; you can take your massage there.",Prabhupāda,This is your own house? What you have paid for it?
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Well, now we are leasing with option to buy. We have ten-year lease, we can purchase anytime before ten years.",Prabhupāda,Price is fixed?
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Six hundred fifty thousand. But all money paid for rent goes toward purchase.,Prabhupāda,That's nice.
Vṛṣākapi:,Vṛṣākapi:No interest.,Prabhupāda,How many rooms?
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Several buildings, Prabhupāda. We have one big temple building down there, very gorgeous, with big kitchen.",Prabhupāda,I may see now?
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:If you like.,Prabhupāda,Or it is closed.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Deities are resting.,Prabhupāda,That's all right.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:In the morning I think it would be better to see things.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Vṛṣākapi:,Vṛṣākapi:We can walk on the property.,Prabhupāda,Morning walk.
Vipina,"The kitchen is governmentally approved, so that if we decide to have a big festival, we can cook and distribute publicly without any problems.",Prabhupāda,These furnitures were there?
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:The doors also, lights, everything we have purchased.",Prabhupāda,Oh. You had to utilize so much money.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:But this is Washington, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Everything, this neighborhood is one of the most wealthy neighborhoods in the country. It is very big. We did not think we would be able to get in so easy. But now people are appreciating how we have fixed up the property. So they have accepted us into the community, but it is very wealthy. You will see some of the houses.",Prabhupāda,They have seen our books?
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:In four months, they have transformed this.",Prabhupāda,That's good. This wooden wall was there?
Vṛṣākapi:,Vṛṣākapi:It was all dirty.,Prabhupāda,It was not used.
Vipina,"That was one reason that we were very much attracted to the property. The property itself was not very beautiful when we came, but the gym was built, and we saw it as an immediate temple where we could holdkīrtanaand preach. So we then made a contract and the fish bit.",Prabhupāda,Nobody was taking.
Vipina,No one was taking it.,Prabhupāda,(laughs) Our Detroit property is like that.
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:White elephant.,Prabhupāda,"Nobody was taking, but it was quite suitable for us. And that is the finest property. You have seen it?"
Vṛṣākapi:,Vṛṣākapi:I have seen it.,Prabhupāda,Is it not?
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:It is the finest, the finest.",Prabhupāda,"And we have got very cheap. One room will cost three hundred thousand, it is so costly. They said they spend about two millions dollars fifty years ago."
Vipina,"Fifty years ago. That's ten, twenty million now.",Prabhupāda,But nobody was taking.
Narottama:,"Narottama:Hot milk. And there is fruit, Śrīla Prabhupāda, there is fruit also.",Prabhupāda,Come on.Jaya.(pause) You take. That's all. What is this?
Hari,Hari-śauri:He's learned how to make Indian sweets very expertly. He was making them in Detroit.,Prabhupāda,Hmm. Where he is going now?
Vipina,This is realprasādamdistribution.,Prabhupāda,Very nice.
Vipina,"Those are melons, Prabhupāda. Watermelons, sweet melons, they are the best.",Prabhupāda,"I take America as my fatherland. India is motherland, and here is fatherland. (laughs) So many fathers. My father was very affectionate to me. He would do everything for me. I lost one father, I have got so many fathers."
Vipina,"What do you say, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,"That, everyone appreciated that in India, that the American fathers keeping him. Just like keeping him in cotton. (laughs) They admit that. Where is salt? There are many flies here?"
Vipina,"Not many, and we have screens also in the windows, so there shouldn't be too much disturbance from them.",Prabhupāda,Fruits are so nice.Kṛṣṇahas given fruit. They are locally grown?
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:No, Prabhupāda. Not too many. They all come from other parts of the country.",Prabhupāda,Your country?
Vṛṣākapi:,Vṛṣākapi:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Not outside. Not like England, they have to import from... This is a very good example. Just like salt, we require. A little salt will increase the taste. But because it is absolutely necessary for eating, salt—everyone eats salt, nobody can avoid salt—it does not mean I shall eat too much. If I take this whole salt pot and put into..., ""It is very good,"" that is foolishness. Similarly, sense gratification, so long we have got this material body, we require little. But because it is tasty, let us take it, whole pot, that is mistake. This is going on. This foolishness is going on. Sex life is good; simply take sex life, go on and spoil your whole life. That is going on. If everything is accepted in regulative principle, little salt, that's all, that's very nice. But as soon as you think ""It is very nice. Let me take simply this,"" then it is spoiled. That is wanted. We don't reject anything but accept in a regular way. Flesh eaters? All right, you want flesh? ""No, I want flesh, but I want this big cow."" Why not less important animals? There are so many other animals. The goats are there, the lambs are there, the hogs are there. Take them. WhyKṛṣṇasaysgo-rakṣya? It is a very important animal. It will give you brain substance, thisrasagullā.ThereforeKṛṣṇasaysgo-rakṣya.But this rascal has no knowledge. The cows give us milk, very nutritious. ""Oh, eat the whole cow. Then all nutrition will come."" This is their intelligence. Rubbish civilization. WhyKṛṣṇahas recommendedgo-rakṣya? He never said that other animal. If you are fond of eating flesh, you take other animals, not the cow. Give protection, take milk from it, and prepare nice preparations, that will be good for brain, for your mind. Apart from... There is no question of religious sentiment. From practical."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Just the medical point of view, it is right.",Prabhupāda,"You see. But they are so fools, rascals, they'll not accept it. And they'll give example, ""Christ ate fish"" somewhere; therefore we have to maintain the slaughterhouse. Because Christ ate fish, therefore we have to maintain slaughterhouse. Give the dog a bad name and hang it.Huh? This is going on. So we have to make vigorous propaganda for all this foolishness.Mūḍho nābhijānāti lokomāmebhyaḥparamavyayam.So we are giving the best civilization, thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. With little patience and perseverance you work on it, people will take it. Because there is nothing adulteration; it is pure. Rest assured, if you follow the principles and push on according to the prescription I have given, it will be accepted. May take some time."
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:But they will appreciate the purity.,Prabhupāda,"It is pure. Actually, these fruits and some milk preparation are sufficient. You don't require any flesh. Is the flesh comparable with this nice fruit? (pause) Come on. Sit down."
Devotee:,"Devotee:Is there one for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,"(laughs) Yes, I am not so fool that I shall give everything. (laughter) (end) This is also inhabitable. Where you are going? Take it in writing."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Now they are putting out the same kind of propaganda about Mars that formerly they were putting out about the moon—that there may be life—so that they can use that as an excuse to go. I just read a little bit where they say that due to information sent back by the last spaceship that they sent to Mars, now they think that there's more water vapor in the atmosphere than they at first thought. So that means that there's a good possibility that there may be some bacterial life on Mars. So (laughs) they don't... And then they state that the temperature ranges from-130 to +40 degrees farenheit. So that means that there could be life there in a bacterial form.",Prabhupāda,And why there is no life in moon planet? Some scientists say the temperature is two hundred degrees less than the zero.
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Yes, at night when they said, because there's no atmosphere.",Prabhupāda,"But why these rascals say it is full of dust, and how from the dust so much light is coming, illuminating the whole universe? What is their logic? They have already brought the dust. That dust does not illuminate."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Well, they say just like when the sunlight hits the earth, then the earth appears very bright from outer space. It appears very illuminating.",Prabhupāda,Who says?
Hari,"Hari-śauri:This is the scientists' excuse. They showed some pictures taken from outer space that shows the earth glowing very brightly, like the moon. So they say in the same way when the...",Prabhupāda,Why the glow of the surface of the earth does not illuminate? It does not come between illumination?
Hari,Hari-śauri:Just like when the sun is here everything is bright.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right, when the sun is there."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:The moon is actually illuminating.,Prabhupāda,Why it does not illuminate?
Hari,Hari-śauri:They only say it reflects the sunlight.,Prabhupāda,"Kick their face with shoes. That is the only reward for them. And foolish persons accepting. Just like sun is illuminating. It doesn't require illumination from any other planet. Similarly, if earth is also illuminating, why does it require moonlight in darkness? This common sense does not come into the brain of these rascals who believe that?"
Hari,Hari-śauri:They put their scientific reasoning to explain the different things.,Prabhupāda,"What is their scientific reasoning? Talking like fools and rascals? If something is illuminating, why extra illumination required to illuminate."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Their theory is that there's a dark side of the moon that we've never seen.,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Their theory is that there's a dark..., that actually the moon is reflecting the sun's light. So there's a dark side of the moon.",Prabhupāda,"So far the world is, where is the dark side and the bright side? If you compare like that, then so far this globe is concerned, which one is dark side, which one is bright side?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:No, they say the earth is spinning on its own axis, so all parts of the earth at one time or another receive sunlight.",Prabhupāda,The moon does not do that?
Hari,Hari-śauri:The moon does not revolve on its own axis.,Prabhupāda,Another foolishness.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Just to fit their speculation.,Prabhupāda,Just see. Simply speculation and misleading people.
Hari,"Hari-śauri:There's no basis for it, there's no truth to it at all. (laughs)",Prabhupāda,And you people believed that? I'm surprised. (laughter) You are also fools and rascals.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:They have little models, Śrīla Prabhupāda, made out of plastic.",Prabhupāda,"Ah, they are... Let them, we take them as rascals, that's all.Mūḍha."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:That other argument that you use about how the moon rays give life to the vegetables... So how is it that there's no life on the moon? If the rays from the moon give life, then how is it there's no life where the rays come from?",Prabhupāda,"They have never gone to moon. (laughs) All bogus. And this Mars expedition will be a failure. Let them spend millions of dollars. I told about moon planet ten years ago. It is childish, simply a waste of money and energy. I told this. Now it has proved."
Hari,Hari-śauri:There's no more interest in the moon at all.,Prabhupāda,"No? Kīrtanānanda said ""It is inhabitable."" Ten years ago I said there's no use going there. It is childish, waste of money. But who hears about us? We know moon planet is inhabited by high-class living entities. (laughs) (sarcastically:) And they will allow these rascals to go by their machine."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:When they originally started sending sputniks to the moon, they couldn't even land them properly. They would crash, they said that they were crash-landing spaceships into the moon's surface.",Prabhupāda,Crashed?
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Crash-landing. The spaceship was supposed to just smash into the surface of the moon, like that.",Prabhupāda,"They have never gone. Simply propaganda. Even they have gone, what is the result? Simply with big report that it is inhabitable. (Prabhupāda is eating something:) What is this fiber? Finding? What are other things are there in the... Hmm? What is this? (Hari-śaurilaughs) Hmm? Do they add anything more? Something reddish there?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Sometimes there's a few bugs in it. (laughs) There's some..., it's probably some strands from the mango, fiber from the mango.",Prabhupāda,Do they add mango?
Hari,Hari-śauri:Strawberry and mango and this and that. They make it with some kind of ice cream machine.,Prabhupāda,Hmm? This is not from machine?
Pradyumna,"You first made ice cream in New York, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Someone told me that in 26 Second Avenue, did you make..., you made them ice cream when it was very hot?",Prabhupāda,Hot?
Pradyumna,"It was hot, no, the weather was hot, so you made.",Prabhupāda,"No, you can make ice cream in this, what is called, refrigerator. You can make."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:""Ice"" cream.",Prabhupāda,"(Prabhupāda speaks some gibberish). Big, big words."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Speak as many big words as possible and don't make any point at all, and then everybody will proclaim.",Prabhupāda,So gradually they'll go up to Saturn?
Pradyumna,"Venus is covered by clouds. So no one can see what is there. There's clouds all around the planet. Heavy, what do they call, so that no one can see. So they sent a rocket inside or something to go through the clouds to see what is there. Russians also tried. Fermament. In theBible,they say that on earth there was also..., above the earth there were all clouds at one time according to theBible.And then at that time men used to live very, very long, and then the clouds went away at some point. They call it a firmament. So the same thing is on Venus. No one can see what the planet is like, no one has ever known. That is also a heavenly, we say also... That is Śukrācārya's place?",Prabhupāda,"Not Śukrācārya's, just Śukra."
Pradyumna,Just Śukra.,Prabhupāda,"May be Śukrācārya's place. What benefit they will have? Nothing. This is science. Without any aim, without any objective."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:What they're doing is entirely pointless. There's no proper reason for any of it. Because they aren't improving their actual living standards by it. They are... It's just like ajñāni,he thinks advancement of knowledge, just to simply acquire any amount of knowledge.",Prabhupāda,Kevala-bodha-labdhaye.They are described:Kliśyantiyekevala-bodha-labdhaye.Simply works hard simply to know things. No benefit. These rascals are like that.Kevala-bodha-labdhaye.
Hari,"Hari-śauri:That's the futility of the university system now. They are going and they're accumulating knowledge which is worthless for living. It has no practical value, so all the youth are becoming very frustrated.",Prabhupāda,"Any sane man will be frustrated. Why you are spending money and going there?Kevala-bodha-labdhaya,kliśyantikevala,bhaktim....Kliśyantiyekevala-bodha-labdhayeteṣāmasaukleśalaevaśiṣyatenānyadyathāsthūla-tuṣāvaghātinām.Just like the husk... The outer portion of rice? If there is rice, you husk, beat it, rice will come. The rice is not there, simply husk, what is the use of this beating? It is like that. Rice will not come, simply they are trying to beat it. So the result is they become tired, that's all. They only result is they'll become tired.Kleśalaevaśiṣyate,that's all. The result of hard labor is tiresome. So they'll get that only, that's all. They are satisfied, ""Now we are tiresome, let us sleep."" What you have gotten? ""Dust."" That's all. This is the philosophy.Bhaktim,what is that verse?"
Pradyumna,Śramaevahikevalam[SB1.2.8]?,Prabhupāda,"Huh? That's not it.Kleśala, kleśala."
Pradyumna,"Kleśadikataras,kleśa?",Prabhupāda,Kliśyantiyekevala-bodha-labdhayeteṣāmasaukleśalaevaśiṣyatenānyadyathāsthūla-tuṣāvaghātinām.
Hari,Hari-śauri:It's from theBhāgavatam?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, it is mentioned in theCaitanya-caritāmṛta.Any process you accept, rejecting devotional service, the result will be that there is no profit. You simply labor for nothing, as much as to beat the husk, you'll never get the rice, you will simply be tiresome, that's all. Just like so-called religion. There is no faith in God. There is no need of God, and ""religion."" This is nonsense. Religion means without God? This is going on. God, you can accept anyone, Ramakrishna Mission. Any rascal...He was a fool, illiterate rascal, Ramakrishna. He became God. No standard, and they are propagating Ramakrishna Mission. As we are preachingKṛṣṇais God, they are preaching Ramakrishna. And who's accepting them? For the last hundred years, they are preaching. So who has become a devotee of Ramakrishna?"
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:It's absurd to even think about becoming a devotee of Ramakrishna.,Prabhupāda,You have gotCaitanya-caritāmṛta?
Pradyumna,I think it is Tenth Canto.Śreyaḥśrutiṁbhaktim?I've been making a list of all the verses that you quote most.,Prabhupāda,That's nice.
Pradyumna,,Prabhupāda,There is note?
Pradyumna,"Bhaktiṁvinājñānaṁtunaiva siddhyed ityaha(indistinct)śreyaḥśrutimiti;śreyasamabhyudayāpavarga-lakṣanānaṁ sṛtiḥśaraṇaṁ,yasyaḥsarasaivanirjharanam,taṁtetavabhaktimudasyatyaktvāśreyasaṁmārga-bhūtamitivā;teṣāṁkleśalaḥkleśaevāvaśiṣyate.Ayaṁbhavān(indistinct)yathāalpapramāṇamdhanyaṁparityajyaantaḥ(indistinct) kanahinaṁsthula-dhanyabhasams tusaneva (indistinct) vaghnanti,teṣāṁnaki&#241citphalaṁ,evaṁbhaktiṁtucchi-kṛtyayekevala-bodhayaprayatante,teṣāmapiti.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Simply tiresome, that's all. Religion, no God. There are so many religions."
Hari,Hari-śauri:Soon as they forget the actual religion then there are so many concoctions.,Prabhupāda,"""This is our religion."" What is religion? ""No God."" What is religion? Then, those who are godless, they have got religion. Atheism has got religion. Then why bring this religion? What is the meaning of religion? Just see."
Pradyumna,"One time we went to a church in Boston to speak. They had only a pulpit for the preacher, and behind, no altar, no crucifix, nothing, just big map of outer space with planets on the wall. Not even any Christian church, but no cross, nothing. Only universe. Universalist Church, it's called. The Universalists.",Prabhupāda,"That's nice, but give some information of the universe."
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Says, ""Religion: 1. monastic condition, being a monk or a nun, enter into a monastic order; 2. practice of sacred rites; 3. one of the prevalent systems of faith and worship, i.e. Christian, Muhammadan, etc.; 4. human recognition of superhuman controlling power and especially of a personal God entitled to obedience, effect of such recognition on conduct and mental attitude.""",Prabhupāda,This is religion. Personal conception of God.
Hari,"Hari-śauri:And then ""5. action that one is bound to do.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Everything is there. Any one of them you take. That's good idea, but special conception of personal God,huh? What is that?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:""Human recognition of superhuman controlling power and especially of a personal God entitled to obedience.""",Prabhupāda,"That's all, clear. What are the other items?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Then, ""the effect of such recognition on conduct and mental attitude."" And then ""action that one is bound to do.""",Prabhupāda,"One is bound to do.Dharmenahinapaśubhiḥsamana.If he does not do, then he's animal. It must be done. There is no question of optional. If you are human being, you must be religious, you must recognize the supreme controller. Otherwise, you are animal. What is the other interpretations? Beginning one?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:""Monastic condition, being a monk or a nun.""",Prabhupāda,"Just like every religion has got some condition, monastic, is it not?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Yes, every religion has a system of priests.",Prabhupāda,(Coughs severely for a few minutes) Monastic condition?
Hari,"Hari-śauri:""Practice of sacred rites.""",Prabhupāda,"So, without reference to God, what is the meaning of sacred rites? Everything is reference that accepting the supreme controller. That is the real meaning. At least, Christian religion accepts God, Muhammadan religion accepts God, orHindureligion accepts God. So without God, how it can be religion? If there is no understanding of God, the conclusion comes that there is no religion. Fictitious. ""We trust in God,"" but do not know what is God. This is going on. So we have to fight against all this nonsense. Nonsense scientists, nonsense religionists. What do you think? It is not easy-going, sleeping business. We have to fight with so many demons. Otherwise,kavadavaadakanam(?), myGuruMahārājaused to say. Beg some rice and bring it and cook it and eat and sleep."
Pradyumna,Kava daka?,Prabhupāda,"Kavadavaadakanam.As all our Godbrothers are doing. They have got a little temple, and a few devotees go and beg rice and cook it and eat and sleep, that's all."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Like being dead almost.,Prabhupāda,"No fighting spirit.Ṭhākuradekhiya(indistinct).Just make a Deity, show. OurTīrthaMahārājais doing that. His whole idea was, that ""I have now captured the birthplace ofCaitanyaMahāprabhuby high-court favor. Now I have got everything. People will come and they'll pay something, and that will be my income for my family."" As thecastegosvāmīsdo inNavadvīpaand other... A means of livelihood. He has no devotion. He wanted as a means of income. Like theVṛndāvanagosvāmīs,Navadvīpagosvāmīsdo. Little devotion, automatically, there is. They are, after all, worshiping the Deity. But their purpose is different. Just like we have establishedRādhā-Vṛndāvanacandra not that people will come and pay something. Who will come here, in this foreign country or in this secluded place? So our aim is to make the devotees real devotees. Not for earning money. When we establish a center in a place like this, where is the idea of getting money? (laughs) Who will come here? One, it is a foreign country, nobody knows what isKṛṣṇa. And one has to come with so great difficulty, on the mountain. And who is coming to pay for it? After spending so much money, they will come here to pay? Our process is that wherever we stay, we worshipKṛṣṇa. As far as possible. That we are doing. Not for earning money but spending money. NowTīrthaMahārājais seeing that without gettingCaitanyaMahāprabhu's birthsite, SwamiMahārāja, he is attractinglakhsof people. Without the favor of high-court, he is attracting. That is his envy. This year, you were not present?"
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:At Māyāpura?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, you were present?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:That leaflet that he put out that we saw, he put one leaflet advertising that...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Apart from that leaflet... Let him do whatever nonsense... But actually, on the birthday ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu, there was the greatest crowd in our temple."
Pradyumna,"Every year, before, last year, year before, year before,CaitanyaMath, only, not...",Prabhupāda,Nobody goes.
Pradyumna,"No, only their Math people, and some people they invite from Calcutta. But the regular people all come in to our place.",Prabhupāda,Sometimes we went toMādhavaMahārāja's temple?
Hari,Hari-śauri:InVṛndāvana.,Prabhupāda,InVṛndāvana. Who was there?
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:They had to unlock the Deity.,Prabhupāda,"And that is on the prominent roadside. And our temple is off. Still, so many people are coming. Neither there were inhabitants nor their outsider, visitors.Gatewas closed, we had to open and then enter. And he constructed temple at least for the last twenty years."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:They have no vision of expanding, except maybe their...",Prabhupāda,"They make this money-making machine. They do not know the money will automatically come you are sincere. You haven't got to make it a machine. MoneyKṛṣṇawill send. But they have no faith inKṛṣṇa. They have faith in their own ability. ""Yes, we shall earn money in this way, by showing the Deity."" They don't recognize Kṛṣṇa's everything. They think ""By high-court judgement, if we capture this place, then money will come."""
Hari,"Hari-śauri:Practically speaking, they're finished. They're on their last legs.",Prabhupāda,"Similarly, othersvāmīsand yogis they are finding that this BhaktivedantaSvamialone is preaching all over the... ""We, combined, we could not do anything."""
Pradyumna,"They are all wondering what your secret is. They always wonder, they cannot understand.",Prabhupāda,"All the yogis,svāmīsare there. How it is possible? The Ramakrishna Mission, they are working here for the last hundred years. What they have done? If they had actually preached something, so so many American boys and gentlemen are coming to our temple, we cannot give them place. We have to find out some other, and who is going to the Ramakrishna temple?"
Pradyumna,They have empty house.,Prabhupāda,"If actually Vivekananda preached something, out of inquisitiveness they would have gone there. So ""We have heard so much about Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. Let us see what is there."" Nobody goes. They do not know even the name. And we are already advertised all over the world,HareKṛṣṇaMovement. At least, everyone knows. Who knows Ramakrishna, Vivekananda? This isBrahma-stotra?"
Pradyumna,"Yes, FourteenthAdhyāya.Frombrahmovaca,brahma-stuti.",Prabhupāda,"Just stick to this principle, then you will be successful.Bhaktiśreyaḥśrutim.That is the real welfare.Śreyaḥśrutimmeans ""expands auspicity."" (apparently talking about a picture) And they want to become one with God. And here is not one, but God is so lower that He carries the shoe of His devotee. Have they got any conception like this? (laughs)"
Hari,Hari-śauri:They are always talking about...,Prabhupāda,There is a verseśrutimahāpureśrutimahāpure.You know this?
Pradyumna,Śrutiapare?,Prabhupāda,"Śruti mahāpure. (indistinct)yasyalindeparaṁbrahma.""Let others worship theśrutisand otherssmṛtis,all these Vedic literature, and othersMahābhāratafor liberation. But I shall worshipNandaMahārāja, because in his courtyard theParamBrahmāis loitering. I shall worshipNandaMahārāja. He's so powerful that he's made theParamBrahmancome here and carry his shoes.""Śruti mahāpure (indistinct)yasyalindeparaṁbrahma."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:That was by a Muslim who becameVaiṣṇava? Once you quoted that, I think that verse, in London.",Prabhupāda,"That is another similar verse. Yes, you quoted me. And there is another verse byBilvamaṅgala, inKṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta.The Muslim, he said ""I was searching after theParamBrahma, and now I see here He is playing with thegopīs."" What they will speculate? Everything is there inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Where this picture is given? (Prabhupāda is being massaged)"
Pradyumna,"LordCaitanyadid the same thing. He did the same thing, and it was comparedKṛṣṇaalso had done.",Prabhupāda,"If there is no such acceptance, where is religion?"
Hari,"Hari-śauri:It just becomes a show. Religion nowadays has degenerated so that people more or less accept it just as some moral code now, because there's no knowledge of God.",Prabhupāda,So where is that morality?
Hari,Hari-śauri:(laughs) There's no morality either.,Prabhupāda,"While hunting, drinking, meat-eating, is that morality?"
Hari,Hari-śauri:No. (end),Prabhupāda,What is that building?
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:This is the neighborhood. It is a very rich neighborhood, Prabhupāda. Very wealthy. This is the most wealthy neighborhood, practically all of America. The builders are putting up houses all in here just like that house over there.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, bungalow type (?). Very good. This is very nice. Is it not? Very nice."
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Some do. One man does. We've been here a short time, only four months. So we have to advertise more so people will come on the Sunday feast. But I think we will have thousands.",Prabhupāda,That is nice. [break] ...trees very long?
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Just pine trees and oak trees. No fruit trees. [break] He was run over by a car, he was intoxicated.",Prabhupāda,"Then? What happened, he was not identified?"
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:They said that he lived in these woods back here, way back in the woods.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, drunkard."
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Yes. They had many cars here all day for two days. All the police, ambulance, TV.",Prabhupāda,To take photograph?
Vṛṣākapi:,Vṛṣākapi:To take photograph of the place. It became a monument. (laughter),Prabhupāda,Just to see a dead body.
Hari,Hari-śauri:Crows. (end),Prabhupāda,(Prabhupāda is eating.)
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:...Deities we have ordered. They will be arriving in two months. Also we have Prabhupāda-Bhaktisiddhānta deities. They will be coming also. We will be the first in America to have Prabhupāda, Bhaktisiddhānta andSītā-Rāma.",Prabhupāda,Here?
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Yes, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,Very good. Thisrasagullāis nice.
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Not as good asKeśīdāsa.,Prabhupāda,They make it likeKeśīdāsain New Vrindaban. (long pause) Water.
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:Here, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. [break] ...to purchase it? And he has to sell to us. Nobody will purchase.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:No. And we have the option secured with a deposit. Otherwise, we would not spend so much money.",Prabhupāda,"Now, as soon as possible, you purchase. Six hundred thousand?"
Vṛṣākapi: :,Vṛṣākapi: :It's cheaper to make the payments than to try and buy.,Prabhupāda,ButRāmeśvarahas not agreed to pay?
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:No, we do not have to get money from BBT this way. This way we do not have to take loan. It is good, because BBT does not have that much money.",Prabhupāda,"No, we need, we supply money to India. Depend onKṛṣṇa;Kṛṣṇawill supply."
Vipina,"Jaya.That happened just about less than a month ago. Some gentleman who was a Seventh Day Adventist, he became interested and started to call and come by and listened to the philosophy and even listened to your tapes. And then shortly after that he gave a donation of five thousand dollars. We bought with it some chandeliers for Kṛṣṇa's temple for you to see tomorrow.",Prabhupāda,Five thousand dollars?
Vipina,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Don't misspend.
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Yes, it rings, but you can't hear it in here. It rings in the back quarters.",Prabhupāda,The doors you have purchased?
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Yes.,Prabhupāda,It is costly?
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:The other doors were not..., they could not even be locked nicely.",Prabhupāda,Very nice.
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:We are hoping if you like it, you will stay here, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"I want to stay, but..."
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:...cannot. (toPuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:) On the other side, it works. This Washington temple actually is one of your oldest centers, but this is the first time you have been able to come when facilities were proper.",Prabhupāda,Indians are coming?
Rūpānuga:,Rūpānuga:Yes.,Prabhupāda,They come on the Love Feast?
Vipina,"They are starting to come more now. With the changes we made in the temple, and they are being very much impressed that we are doing nicely, and they want to become a part.",Prabhupāda,"I heard that Ambassador, you have made some engagement?"
Vipina,"Prabhupāda, he, I got a call from his secretary, and I've been working on it and I've been to his house once. He has a very nice stately house. He had requested that maybe you could come there to his home, and your servant andPuṣṭaKṛṣṇawere thinking it might be hard for you to travel there. So we're trying to convince him to come here.",Prabhupāda,Ah. There is no question of insisting. They cannot help us in any way.
Vipina,"No, not at all.",Prabhupāda,I have tried all these. They are useless.
Vṛṣākapi:,"Vṛṣākapi:We have written all the Parliament and we have asked them to come, but they are too busy.",Prabhupāda,So you go and take rest.
Devotees:,Devotees:Jaya. Haribol.,Prabhupāda,There is much time difference from...?
Devotees:,Devotees:Same time. It is ten-thirty now.,Prabhupāda,"No, New Vrindaban and...?"
Rūpānuga:,"Rūpānuga:Should I close this, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,I'm going to the bedroom.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like a fan that doesn't make so much noise perhaps?",Prabhupāda,May be required. (end) Some talking? There is no talking? This slide's without talking?
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Yes, we will make little... We are just testing.",Prabhupāda,All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.
Hari,"Hari-śauri:I've got a torch, flashlight. (whispering and movement going on)",Prabhupāda,You can cover it with some cloth. Take that cloth.
Hari,Hari-śauri:Use thatcādaraon the back of the rocking chair.,Prabhupāda,"Cādarawill be too heavy. Here, take this."
Svarūpa,"SvarūpaDāmodara:Now most of these slides will appear in our book, the origin of life and matter,Life Comes From Life.Now Sadāpūta and myself made these slides. These are some of the... Only a few slides. We specifically want comments from your Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda, whether these slides will be appropriate to be in the book. Now this is the philosophy between the difference between life and matter. So this issāṅkhyaphilosophy. The principles and the philosophy, as Śrīla Prabhupāda comments inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamin the Third Canto, thesāṅkhyaphilosophy is especially meant for persons who are conditioned by this material world, and by understanding the science of devotional service andsāṅkhyaphilosophy, one can become free from the modes of material nature. So we want to impose that in order to understand the distinction between life and matter, one must at least have a glimpse of the Absolute Truth, at least some idea of the Absolute Truth. Otherwise, it is completely impossible to understand the difference between what is life and what is matter. That is why scientists nowadays are so much confused about the concept of life and matter. So in fact the scientist Orgell, in his bookThe Origin of Life,he starts with saying ""What is life? The question 'What is life?' should not be inquired."" He says...",Prabhupāda,"One minute. That Absolute Truth is explained in theVedānta-sūtra, janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].Absolute Truth is that from whom everything comes into existence, everything emanates.

<div class=""Purp-para"">The translation says, ""My dear respectful mother, I have already described the path of understanding the Absolute Truth by which one can come to understand the real truth of matter and spirit and their relationship."" So here it clearly says that in order to understand these basic principles, one must have at least some idea about the Absolute Truth. And it is quite scientific. Comparing our normal scientific disciplines like physics, chemistry and mathematics, in fact this very principle is utilized. But the scientists, not knowing that the axioms, or fundamental truths, are coming from the absolute source. So this is the basic requirement.</div>

So contraceptive method means that emulsification is disturbed. It does not create the proper situation; therefore pregnancy does not happen. Or imperfect discharge. The main point is that the two discharges, they create a situation wherein the living entity comes and rests. Then it will grow. Not that that is the cause of life. The mixture of two secretions is not the cause of life. That creates a proper situation, and the life comes. And if the situation is not favorable, the soul cannot stay. It has to go to somewhere else.

The same topic is continued in this chapter. In order to give a particular type of human form to a person who has already suffered hellish life, the soul is transferred to the semina of a man who is just suitable to become his father. During sexual intercourse, the soul is transferred through the semina of the father into the mother's womb in order to produce a particular type of body. This process is applicable to all embodied living entities, but it is especially mentioned for the man who has transferred to the <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/andha"" class=""d"">Andha</a>-<a href=""/d/tamisra"" class=""d"">t&#257;misra</a></span> hell. After suffering there, when he who has had many types of hellish bodies, like those of dogs and hogs, is to come again to the human form, he is given the chance to take his birth in the same type of body from which he degraded himself to hell. Everything is done by the supervision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Material nature supplies the body, but it does so under the direction of the Supersoul. It is said in <span class=""Italic"">Bhagavad-<a href=""/d/gita"" class=""d"">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> that a living entity is wandering in this material world on a chariot made by material nature. The Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, is always present with the individual soul. He directs material nature to supply a particular type of body to the individual soul according to the result of his work, and the material nature supplies it. Here one word, <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/retah"" class=""d"">reta&#7717;</a>-ka&#7751;&#257;&#347;raya&#7717;,</span> is very significant because it indicates that it is not the semina of the man that creates life within the womb of a woman; rather, the living entity, the soul, takes shelter in a particle of semina and is then pushed into the womb of a woman.

<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Sad&#257;p&#363;ta:</span> This slide shows..., these are the laws of nature according to physicists. And the point we make is that this is their understanding of the final cause of things, and it's very limited. Actually, on this one page, these equations describe everything that goes into all the actions and interactions of chemistry according to their present understanding. And, so there are two main points to make about this. Number one, these are very..., these laws describe very simple forces, pushes and pulls between atoms and things like that. And so intuitively it is very hard to imagine why such simple forces should cause anything complex to organize itself together. Now the scientists customarily make the assertion that laws like this are universal, but one thing we can notice is they have no proof of that. These laws which they say are universal are only studied in certain limited experimental situations with inanimate matter, and then they extrapolate and they say that they apply to everything. But actually the equations are so hard to solve even for reasonably simple molecules that they can't actually test out their assertion. So it's actually just a bluffing statement. So in this slide we wanted to point out how limited these laws are, how limited their concept of the laws of nature is. The next slide, according to the scientist's idea, there are two things going on&mdash;these laws and also chance. So this is a calculation showing what happens if you just have chance acting to form one of these proteins that <a href=""/d/svarupa"" class=""d"">Svar&#363;pa</a> <a href=""/d/damodara"" class=""d"">D&#257;modara</a> was talking about, and you can calculate... Actually here you calculate, suppose you threw a protein together at chance&mdash;and here we even allow a ten percent error, you're allowing to get it wrong among ten percent of the proteins&mdash;but still chance comes out to ten minus two-hundred-and forty-fourth-power. Now the scientists are always saying if you wait for a long enough time, even something very unlikely can happen; but here we have a calculation of how long you'd have to wait, according to mathematics and the probability theory, and even if you assume an unrealistically high rate of forming proteins at random, still you'd have to wait, according to this, ten to the hundred-and-sixty-seventh-power billion years. And that's a little bit too long. (laughter)</div>

<A NAME=""455900""></A><div id=""455900""> </div>
<div class=""Purp-para""><span class=""Bold"">Sad&#257;p&#363;ta:</span> So mathematics shows that chance alone would never begin to produce the things that go into life, because this, say, is just for one protein, but it's estimated in the simplest cell that they experiment with that there are some three thousand proteins. This is what they estimate. And in a human, in a single cell of the human body, they estimate three hundred thousand, or even three million. It's just an estimate. But it shows that chance is completely unrealistic. Now the scientists will say that both chance and natural laws somehow mysteriously go together in what they call natural selection to produce living structures. In the next slide, this is also a calculation, and it shows that that is not correct either, at least as far as the mathematics goes. What this says is suppose you look at the earth and you're going to wait four point five billion years&mdash;that's what they estimate is the age of the earth&mdash;and ask what is the chance of finding a given organized structure. And mathematically there's a thing called information theory, and you can show that the chance of getting an organized structure with a high level of information goes down exponentially, so that for an amount of information higher than that of the laws that cause these things to move, the chance goes down practically to zero. So it wouldn't happen. So this gets kind of complicated, but there's a basic point behind it; namely it indicates that the natural laws that are causing things, like that list of those laws, must already have in them, built into them, whatever is going to be manifested. That is, if some given structure can be manifested in the material world, that means the laws that are causing things must already have at least that much built into them. But their understanding of natural laws, the laws are too simple, too short to have that kind of thing built into them. So there's that argument. We'll go on to the next one. This is some mathematical formulas related to that. I don't think we should dwell on that. This slide right here gives an example of the kind of structures you find even in simple organisms. This is a bacterium. When they look at it under a microscope, they can see that this bacterium has a reversible motor built into it, and this motor spins a spiral flagellum, and by spinning it it propels the bacteria through the water, just like a submarine. So this very sophisticated motor is built into the wall of the bacterium. So that shows the kind of structures for which designs would have to be there. Actually, the scientific explanation, the way that they explain how this comes about, is completely impossible, because they would say that either by chance it came about all at once&mdash;and the chances are way too small, so that would never happen&mdash;or else it would have to come by small stages somehow. But what would be a small stage in the formation of a workable motor? Can't even think of how that would work. So it doesn't make much sense. So what we wanted to argue was that these living structures are very highly complex, they have a very great amount of information needed to specify them, and then mathematically it follows that this evolution process can't happen, because the probability is way down, it's something impossible. So we wanted to argue that. The next slide&mdash;whoops, we're going the wrong way, there. We wanted to compare some structures. This is the chemist's idea of what a diamond..., the top picture is a chemist's idea of what the structure of a diamond looks like. It's based on very simple repeating patterns. It's reasonable perhaps that chemical pushes and pulls could produce a simple design like this just by pulling the molecules together. The lower thing is a structure for graphite, which is another simple design built on hexagons. But on the other hand, in living systems you have things like this. (shows slide) According to the way they've analyzed it, there are chemical structures of this complexity. So we'd like to argue that this requires a very large amount of information to specify this thing, and so the simple natural laws couldn't account for this. On the other hand, it's very reasonable to suppose that an intelligent designer can account for things like that. These protein structures that <a href=""/d/svarupa"" class=""d"">Svar&#363;pa</a> <a href=""/d/damodara"" class=""d"">D&#257;modara</a> was pointing out, it's not just any old structure, but it performs a very specific function within the cell, just like a little automatic machine of some kind. So we'd like to argue that the chance and molecular forces theory won't explain things like this, but to say that there is an intelligent designer would be a sensible explanation. The next slide, this shows some of the complexities of what goes on inside a cell, and it's only a fraction of what is there. It's hard to read, but each little bit of print refers to some very complicated chemical reaction involving big molecules like the one in the last slide. So there are hundreds of reactions like that on this one page, and this page is one out of four from a chart that we found detailing some of these things. This metabolism goes on even in the most primitive cells like this bacterium, and yet it's only a fraction of the total of what goes on. The scientists will admit they've only made a fractional study of all that's going on in these cells. So that kind of argument is one line of reasoning we'd like to present. (another slide) Now this refers to another thing. We'd like to describe the concept of consciousness as being something not material&mdash;nonphysical and nonchemical. And it turns out that actually in modern physics that's already a basic principle, and it's been that way for the last fifty or sixty years, but that's not widely admitted or taught in the schools. But actually in modern physics, it's called quantum mechanics. They realize that in order to describe physical processes you have to include the observer in the picture; you can't describe these things without accounting for the observer, and so they made an analysis. This was done by von Neumann, who was one of these physicists. He analyzed the difference between the observer and the observed. So here we have a man looking through, say, a microscope at some object, and you can see that in this case you can draw the line between the observer and the observed. So the man is observing the microscope plus object. And physically there are, according to the physicist's idea, there are these equations, represented by number one, equation number one, which describe all the molecules and forces of interaction on the observed side. But there's another kind of equation that goes in quantum mechanics, which corresponds to the observer's side, and this equation is completely different from the first equation. So this indicates that the observer must be something different in nature from the observed. Now the next slide shows here the boundary between the observer and the observed is moved. It's kind of arbitrary. You can move the boundary back so now the observed becomes the eyeball and the microscope and the object, and the observer is still on the other side. And the basic idea is you can move this boundary back, step by step, and on one side you can put, at least in principle, more and more of the parts of the body into the observed system, but on the other side you still have the observer, and he continues to be described by an equation that can't be reduced to the force laws that are used to describe the observed. So the conclusion is that the observer must be something nonphysical. He's not actually part of that physical body at all. So that's actually basic in quantum mechanics. So we wanted to present that. Now this slide... There's another line of evidence here. It's the inspiration, and &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da has said that intelligence is the form direction of Supersoul. So it's interesting, it's really striking to observe how various people create things in mathematics and science and art, like that. It's very striking. So we made two examples here. This one is a mathematician names Gauss. He lived in the nineteenth century, and his concern was to solve mathematical proble</div>
<A NAME=""455901""></A><div id=""455901""> </div>
<div class=""Normal-Level"">ms. The interesting thing is that in a very difficult mathematical problem, the person never solves it by figuring it out consciously, step by step. But what happens is that he tries very hard to figure it out for a long time, and nothing happens, and then all of a sudden the answer comes to him. So it's hard to read that quote. This is a quotation by this Gauss describing how that happened to him.</div>

But Mozart apparently just got these things without having to struggle for them, as though that was his past <span class=""Italic""><a href=""/d/karma"" class=""d"">karma</a></span> or something. Next slide. This is a summary of the basic kind of argument we wanted to make. The picture on the left, those ovals represent states of matter, configurations of matter, and they go from simple, toward the bottom, like just a chemical solution, up towards more complex as you go up, like living bodies of different kinds. The theory of evolution is sort of indicated in the left-hand one. According to that theory, you have very simple natural laws, and you start out with simple physical states, but somehow these natural laws produce a progressive increase in order, as indicated by those arrows going up. But actually we want to argue that simple natural laws don't have the power to do that, and that the situation on the right is what would happen if you just had simple natural laws, namely they would keep shoving things around on a simple level but never produce anything complex. The next slide, though, indicates that if you had natural laws with a high order of complexity, then they could manifest physical situations with a high order of complexity also, depending on how much was built into the laws. So we wanted to, in these two examples, indicate a higher and higher order of natural laws. So what we wanted to do was then combine these two things together, on the one hand that consciousness is not a physical phenomenon, and on the other hand, that in order to get...</div>

Such a great soul is very rare."" Purport. ""The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism. But when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes, and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord, &#346;r&#299; <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Thus he thinks of everything in relation to <a href=""/d/vasudeva"" class=""d"">V&#257;sudeva</a>, or &#346;r&#299; <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Such a universal vision of <a href=""/d/vasudeva"" class=""d"">V&#257;sudeva</a> precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href=""/d/krsna"" class=""d"">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare. This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter of <span class=""Italic"">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara <a href=""/d/upanisad"" class=""d"">Upani&#7779;ad</a>:</span> 'In this body there are power of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the Supreme Lord. And because <a href=""/d/vasudeva"" class=""d"">Vasudeva</a> is all-pervading and everything is <a href=""/d/vasudeva"" class=""d"">Vasudeva</a>, the devotee surrenders in full knowledge.' ""</div>

Some birds we see behave like a little influenced by the modes of goodness, though it is mixed. Like swan, we are taking that example. But some are like eagle, very passionate, wants to kill small birds as their food, and on the other hand, birds like crows, they like just to be completely ignorant, or they like to survive in a dirty environment. Why? Is this possible just from the concept of molecular evolution? It's completely, it's failing. They have no explanation along those terms.

So the form of the body is already there, and the living entity is being transferred from one body to another. This is called transmigration. We have come here, not that that room developed. This room is here, that room is there, but I am transferring. Because they have no idea of soul, they are thinking that this nice room, now transform into this room or this room, transform... This is foolishness. A civil man transferred into jail&mdash;not that his civil house becomes jail. They are thinking wrongly like that, Darwin's theory. Body becoming changed. No. The different types of bodies are already there. The living entity is being transferred from one body to another. Just try to explain. So evolution you take that this apartment is better than that apartment, that apartment better than, and a living entity's going from one after another. So this is evolution.
