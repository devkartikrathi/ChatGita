Hṛdayānanda,"Atomic... That everything is constituted of different atoms, and the ultimate truth is the atomic particle, and by different combinations of these particles, different material manifestations are produced, and there's no other cause except this endless combining of atomic particles.",Prabhupāda,Wherefrom the atom comes?
Hṛdayānanda,The atom is the eternal fact. It is inconceivable or it's unexplainable where it has come from.,Prabhupāda,Then what is the use of your explaining? Then you prove yourself you are a rascal. Inexplicable? Why you are trying to explain?
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:""We're not explaining. We're just accepting it's a fact.""",Prabhupāda,"So everything is fact. But the real knowledge is to find out the source of the fact. That is real knowledge. Just like if we ask any gentleman—at least in India—for your identification, your father's name is required, your name of the village is required. If you go to the court, then such and such; father's name, such and such; village, this; religion, this; like this.... So father.... Why father's name? ""What is the source of your existence? Wherefrom you are coming?"" ""I am coming from this family."" So that is knowledge. Atom.... Atomic theory is there in Vedic conception,paramāṇuvāda.Kaṇada, the great sage, Kaṇada, he gave this theory, Kaṇada.Paramāṇuvāda. Paramāṇuvād. Paramāṇuvādais accepted in Vedic philosophy also. But we know what is thisparamāṇualso. Just like the sunshine. What is the sunshine? A combination of shining atoms. But we can see it is coming from the sun, incessantly coming. We can see. We can, immediately say, ""This is.... The source is the sun."" Similarly, theparamanu,the atoms, they are incessantly coming out. But wherefrom it is coming?"
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Does that mean that the atom is living entity?,Prabhupāda,"Eh? No. Living entity is also atom. One class of atom is matter, and one class of atom is the living entity. That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā.... Bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥkhaṁmanobuddhirevaca[Bg.7.4].These are... This material, matter, everything is combination of atom, atomic particles. Either you take earth or take water or air or fire, everything is combination of atom. That's a fact. But we know that these atoms are coming out as the energy ofKṛṣṇa.Bhinnā.Bhinnāmeans the quality different; not of the same quality.Apareyam:""This is inferior quality, but there is another, superior quality,jīvabhuta,and that is living entity."" So two kinds of atoms are coming fromKṛṣṇa. One is the spiritual atom, and the other is the material atom. So spiritual atoms, they are many, many times greater than the material atoms. And these material atoms is this universal, innumerable universes. Some of the spiritual atoms, when they want to enjoy independently, they are given the chance of enjoying this material atom. So in the material world it is combination of material and spiritual atoms. In the spiritual world, there is no material atom; everything spirit. That is three-fourth energy, and this is one fourth.Paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham.[break]"
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:If we say thatKṛṣṇaenters even within the atom, what is His business there?",Prabhupāda,Business is to guide the rascals like you. (laughter) Do you follow or not?
Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Well, the material atoms...",Prabhupāda,"BecauseKṛṣṇaloves you so much that even you accept this material atom, He goes to help you. Therefore He is within. Becausesarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭhaḥ[Bg.15.15].The living entity has a..., enjoying this material world. So he has got everything. He's a person. He has got his heart. So in the heart there isKṛṣṇa.Sarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭho.You readBhagavad-gītā.Why? Why He has...,sarvasyacāhāmhṛdisanniviṣṭho? Hmm? Who will say? Why He has...? Your question is ""Why?"""
Hṛdayānanda,Mattaḥsmṛtir...,Prabhupāda,"Ah!Mattaḥsmṛtirjñānam.He's always trying: ""You rascal, why you are suffering in this way? Come back home."" This is the answer. He's so kind. That is His kindness.Sarvasyacāhāmhṛdisanniviṣṭhomattaḥsmṛtirjñānamapohanaṁca[Bg.15.15].We are talking of this philosophy, ""How?""Kṛṣṇais giving intelligence. Otherwise, how it is possible? The same thing, as we are preachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness by the dictation ofKṛṣṇa—Kṛṣṇa is asking,sarva-dharmānparityajamāmekaṁśaraṇa—so in the atom also He's doing the same business.Aṇḍāntara-sthaṁparamāṇu-cayāntara-stham.Now your question is answered or not? Eh?"
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"WhyKṛṣṇais within the atom? That is answered or not? Wherever there is the living entity,Kṛṣṇais there as friend.Su-parna, sayujā.So, from theśāstrait is understood, as many material atoms are there, so many spiritual atoms are there. Now you can imagine how many living entities are there. (sic:) Physists, they have not been able to find out the spiritual atom. Therefore they are puzzled, and their scientific research is incomplete. But theBhagavad-gītāgives them information, ""You rascal, this is inferior. These material atoms are inferior.""Apareyam.They'll not take it.Apareyam itastu:""Besides this, there is another energy, spiritual energy."" ""What is that spiritual energy? We do find."" ""You don't find? Why don't you seejīva-bhūta,these living entities?"" But they are rascals. They will not see. They cannot understand what is this living entity, andKṛṣṇais saying, ""Here is another atom.Apareyam itastumeviddhiprakṛtiṁparā."" But the rascal will not take it. This is their rascaldom.Kṛṣṇais giving them information, and still, they'll not take it. This is their dog obstinacy. Solution is there. They won't have to make very difficult research work. Here is information. But they'll not take it. The atoms which you are studying, that is all right. That is material,apara,inferior. But there is another atom. And if you say, ""What is that atom? We do not find,"" ""Don't you find this living entity?"" And still, they are... They say the problems are solved. Just see how foolish they are. He's seeing the living entity, andKṛṣṇais pointing out: ""Here is the superior atom,"" and still they say, ""We do not know."" What to do with them? Eh? They cannot find out by their own research, and the information is there byKṛṣṇa, and still they'll not take it. So, what is to do with them?"
Dayānanda:,"Dayānanda:We can show that they are fools by presenting your literatures, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Dayānanda:,Dayānanda:We can show that they are actually fools by...,Prabhupāda,"No, no..."
Dayānanda:,Dayānanda:...presenting your books.,Prabhupāda,Yes. OurAcyutānandaMahārājasays... Eh?
Acyutānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,What do you think?
Hṛdayānanda,"Prabhupāda said, ""What should we do with these scientists? They won't accept Kṛṣṇa's knowledge that there is a soul...""",Prabhupāda,"They are find..., researching atom. They could not come to the ultimate conclusion. And we say that this atom is energy, but it is inferior, and there is another energy. So they, if they say that ""We do not find anything except this atom..."""
Acyutānanda,"They cannot explain how, in the body, by eating food, it turns into...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. It is not the question of... First of all, decide there are two kinds of energies working."
Acyutānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Material energy and spiritual energy. So, so far material energy, they have come to the point of atom, and they are searching out. ButKṛṣṇasays, ""Yes, this material atom is all right. But this isapara.This is inferior. There is another superior energy, atom."" What is that? ""Thisjīva-bhūta."" So why don't you not see it? How rascal they are.Jīva-bhūtais there. He is seeingjīvabhuta,living... SoKṛṣṇais giving information, ""Here is the superior atom."" Why don't do they not see to it?"
Acyutānanda,"Because they are so sinful, they cannot see.",Prabhupāda,Yeah. That is the...
Acyutānanda,"Like Duryodhana. Even people criticizeKṛṣṇa, ""Why He could not convince Duryodhana to be peaceful?"" Because there was nothing... He was so sinful that he had used up all his pious...",Prabhupāda,So that is the Duryodhana party.
Acyutānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda,Acchā.
Acyutānanda,The scientists are all sinful.,Prabhupāda,"The Duryodhana party, and we are Pāṇḍu's party. So there must be war always, fighting. And they'll be smashed.Hṛdayānivya...You know that? ""Breaking the heart of the Dhārtarāṣṭra."" So we have to make preaching in such a way to break the heart of thisDhṛtarāṣṭracompany."
Dayānanda:,Dayānanda:Dhārtarāṣṭrānvyadārayat.,Prabhupāda,"Ah,vyadārayat.Then it will be preaching. There are two energies everywhere. The example is given: just like the sun, the two energies working, heat and light. Everyone can see.Parasyabrāhmaṇaḥśaktiḥ. Śaktimeans energy. So whatever we are seeing, that is combination of two energies ofKṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇais also saying the same thing.Parasyabrāhmaṇaḥśaktiḥ.Any child can understand. The sun is situated in one place, localized, and his heat and energy, atomic particles, is being distributed all over the universe. What is this fog? Eh? What is this fog which is obstructing seeing the sun? What is this fog? Hm?"
Devotees:,Devotees:Water.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. The water is also an energy of sun. Because heat is there, within the heat there is water. What is, the physists say? What is the source of water? What do they say?"
Acyutānanda,"They say all the energy is created from the sun, all the planets...",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. That's all right. The sun is heat. So the water is there from the heat. [break] ...these scientists, making research work to find out what is after atom, proton, neutron. They're searching out."
Acyutānanda,They're never satisfied with their achievements.,Prabhupāda,"No, they cannot be because they did not find out what is the ultimate source. They could not. Therefore they cannot be satisfied. If... A really scientist, how he can be satisfied? The goal is not yet achieved. How they can be satisfied? But we are satisfied because we know that the goal, the cause, ultimate cause, isKṛṣṇa. [break] ...instruction is not blind. It is fact. Just like my body is there, and on account of my energy, so I am getting flesh, I am getting nail."
Acyutānanda,"Yes, they cannot explain how the body transforms into...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Acyutānanda,...tissue.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. But explain or not explain, I am seeing practically that two things are coming out: one, the skin, where there is sensation; and where, this nail, there is no sensation. This is matter and spirit. Where there is consciousness, that is spirit. Where there is no consciousness, that is matter."
Hṛdayānanda,Very good example.,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Hṛdayānanda,Very nice example.,Prabhupāda,"But both of them are coming from me. So this sensation, this consciousness, is perfect when it comes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. This is developing, in every living entity is developing. The consciousness, the sensation, is there in the tree also, but he is not developed. When the same consciousness comes to the complete perfection, then he understands, ""Oh, here isKṛṣṇa.""Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁprapadyate[Bg.7.19].That is perfection.Vāsudevaḥsarvamiti:""The real source isVasudeva.""Oṁnamobhagavatevāsudevāya.Then he glorifiesVasudeva. But to knowVasudeva, you make research. That is one way, going on. But if you accept...Vasudevasays, ""I am everything."" Then accept immediately. The whole solution is there. Two, two ways:āroha-panthā, avaroha-panthā.You are trying to search out. Go on. It will take many, many births. But if you accept... The sameVasudevais coming kindlyahaṁsarvasyaprabhavo[Bg.10.8].You accept it, then the knowledge is perfect. Suppose I am making this sound (makes sound with cane). Underneath they are puzzled: ""Wherefrom this sound is coming?"" They are making research. And if I say, ""I am making this sound,"" then everything, knowledge, is there. The rascal will not surrender. Ask the man who is making sound. Then the knowledge is perfect. But he'll make research: ""Wherefrom the sound came?"" This is rascaldom. And one man is suggesting, ""It is... The sound may be like this. The sound may be due to this."" They are going on, researching. But if I say, ""You rascal, why you are contemplating like that? I made this sound like this (make sound with cane). That's all,"" So that knowledge they'll not take.Mūḍhāḥ.Therefore they are...Nābhijānati.Māmebhyaḥparamavyayam.So if we call them allmūḍhas,what is the wrong? They become angry. But if we call them, all these rascals,mūḍhas,what is the wrong? They say, ""Oh, you are using very strong language. You are calling us allmūḍhas."" But actually you are allmūḍhasbecause you do not knowKṛṣṇa. [break] ...ment of atom?"
Dayānanda:,Dayānanda:One ten-thousandth the tip of a hair.,Prabhupāda,"Eh? No, no, atom, this atom. Scientists, they are studying atom. So what is the measurement of atom?"
Hṛdayānanda,So small that...,Prabhupāda,"""So small that..."" A child can say like that."
Hṛdayānanda,"That a million, they say that...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. There are two sizes. One isanu,and one isparamanu.Sixanusmake oneparamanu.That is statement. Sixanus,and combine together it becomes aparamanu.That is atom. Therefore they are dividing atom. That is already there in the Vedic literature."
Acyutānanda,So the scientists' conception of atom is wrong?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Acyutānanda,The scientists' conception of the atom is wrong.,Prabhupāda,Everything is wrong.
Acyutānanda,"But by their, even though they are, they are wrong, by their conception they are making an atomic bomb. They can utilize...",Prabhupāda,"So far you can, can..."
Acyutānanda,To show results.,Prabhupāda,That does not mean he knows everything. That does not mean...
Acyutānanda,"No, but he can say...",Prabhupāda,"Suppose you, you, if you can make a nice vegetable preparation, but that does not mean you know everything of the vegetable. That does not mean. You are still rascal. Although you can prepare a nice preparation with vegetable. But that does not mean you know everything of the vegetable. That iskarukārya.That is calledkarukārya.Just like this mason worker. They know how to set up the bricks and doing nice work. But that does not mean... Wherefrom the brick has come? You can take this flower, make a, what is called, in avase, can make a beautiful..."
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):Bouquet.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Acyutānanda,Arrangement.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, bouquet, yes. That does not mean you know how the flower has come out. That is calledvisarga.Sargaandvisarga.Just likeBrahmāhas created this universe, but that does not mean he is the ultimate cause.Tenebrahmahṛdāyaādi-kavaye[SB1.1.1].Brahmāgot knowledge fromKṛṣṇahow to do it. What is this? [break]...āṇu-cayānthara-stham.[break] ...tejaḥ,heat, the sun, supplying heat and water,vāriandmṛt,and the earth, combination. These things are coming out.Tejo-vāri-mṛt-vinimayam.How these flowers and trees are coming out? There is sunlight, there is water, and there is earth. And there isKṛṣṇaalso, the seed.Bījo 'hamsarva-bhutanam[Bg7.10].So withoutKṛṣṇa, nothing can be... [break] ...there is spirit atom?"
Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:Yes. The arguments are very convincing, especially this last point about how the plants are growing with the help of sunlight, earth, water and... Scientists only have very shallow explanations of how life comes about.",Prabhupāda,[break] ...such verse.Yasminvijñātesarvamevaṁvijñātaṁbhavati(MuṇḍakaUpaniṣad1.3).They do not knowKṛṣṇa. Therefore they cannot understand.
Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:In the introduction toThe Nectar of Devotion,you have also mentioned nicely that even though there are so many scholars and scientists, they cannot even follow these four principles of no meat-eating, illicit sex life and everything. They may have so much academic knowledge, but they cannot even control their senses. But by your mercy, even though we are very inexperienced in such knowledge, we are able to control the senses.",Prabhupāda,"Ajitendriyānām.Without controlling the senses, other things, they are simply professional. It has no value. [break]...yogis,all their methods, they have been described byPrahlādaMahārājaas a way of their livelihood. Actually, they have no knowledge. They are talking of, as knowledge, but they have no knowledge. This profession is their means of their livelihood. Otherwise, they have no value. Just like a magician. He shows some magic, but that does not mean he has all knowledge. He has taken these magic performances as a means of his livelihood. [break]...ti ajitendriyānām.Jugglery of words, they are professional. [break] ...that big, big words. Then people engage them: ""Oh, here is a big scientist."" And if he's not engaged, his talking has no value. By the knowledge he has acquired, he can make some money. That's all."
Hṛdayānanda,That's exactly what's happening.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And if you ask, they will say, ""That we do not know."" So why you are taking money? Exactly they say so. OurSvarūpaDāmodarachallenged that professor who came to lecture in California University. He challenged, ""If I give you chemicals, can you produce life?"" He said, ""That I cannot say."""
Kirtirāja:,"Kirtirāja:""We are trying,"" they said.",Prabhupāda,"Then why you are, you are bluffing and taking money from us? You do not know. [break] I'll have to go to you, and both of them, I'll have to... The Marwari this... Gujaratis, they use too much oil. Similarly Bengalis, too much oil. Imli, imli water?"
Indian devotee (1):,"Indian devotee (1):Yes, and chili.",Prabhupāda,And chili. That's all.
Indian devotee (1):,"Indian devotee (1):Actually, Prabhupāda, in Jaipuriya, when they invited us, when we were in Kanpur, all the devotees, for three days we were eating very simple food, but the devotees liked so much. They were eating lots.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, Jaipuriya invite them?"

Yaśodānandana:,"Yaśodānandana:It has been seen that when many householders come together in many of our big communities, because there are so many women and children, there is a great atmosphere of laziness a lot of times.

Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:I'm not giving awayhisbooks.,Prabhupāda,"No, no, even if he gives away, this is not a fault, ou see? Suppose there are... In South Africa many Indians are purchasing our books and giving to the library. So somebody will read it. So that is not a fault. If I purchase from you and give it, distribute it free to somebody else, that is not wrong thing."
Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:Śrīla Prabhupāda, I don't think that there's any difference in philosophical understanding or anything.

Siddha,"Siddha-svarūpa:If I'm trying to get people to chant, that's all I can do. And if that will purify them, then surrender will come. How can I force someone to surrender?",Prabhupāda,"No, no, what do you mean by surrender?"
Guru,Guru-kṛpā:I mean that...,Prabhupāda,"Not that everywhere you are preaching, you are expected all of them will be surrendered immediately. That is not expected.

Madhudviṣa:,"Madhudviṣa:So therefore the essence of the philosophy must be there. And you have also said that the meaning of disciple means discipline, so the devotees have to be trained certain disciplines in their devotional life.",Prabhupāda,"Discipline...

That is the..."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes, that's more or less what it is.",Prabhupāda,"No, what is the word, exact. There is an English word. ""Obedience is the first law of discipline."" So unless there is obedience, there cannot be any discipline. And unless there is discipline, there is no question of disciple. Disciple means one who follows the discipline. So..."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:So there is no disagreement with that. I have no disagreement.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is the point. That is..."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:But I consider that discipline and the person being disciplined must be voluntary. He must voluntarily put himself under someone's discipline.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that is... Accepting spiritual master means voluntarily accepting somebody to rule him. There is no question... I have no power to rule over you unless you voluntarily surrender."
Siddha,Siddha-svarūpa:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"I am Indian. Why, you Americans, you should obey me? You have done it voluntarily. Yes. So, (chuckles) in India they appreciate me only on this point, that I am Indian; how I am controlling so many Americans? That is their appreciation.

Guru,"Guru-kṛpā:Śrīla Prabhupāda, it mentions inThe Nectar of Devotionthat in theviddhi-mārgathere are many things we don't want to do but we must do in order to make advancement.",Prabhupāda,"No, that is also modern government, democracy. I do not want to do something, but the Parliament pass the laws. We have to do, even I do not like. That is discipline. Just like C. R. Das. C. R.

Fifty years before he was..."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Nowadays tenlakhsper month.,Prabhupāda,"At least fivelakhshe was earning. So the Congress resolution was that ""noncooperation,"" so ""Boycott British court. We are not going on."" So resolution that everyone should give up practice of law in the British court. Resolution. So C. R. Das did not like that idea. He said that ""I am earning fifty thousand. I can give the whole amount for Congress propaganda. Why you are asking me to give up this practice?"" So the resolution was, ""No, we should noncooperate. We don't want money. We should noncooperate."" So when... He fought in the meeting that ""This should be withdrawn."" So it was not withdrawn. Then he resigned. Then he resigned. He became practically poverty-stricken, because he was earning fifty thousand rupees per month, and he had no practice, and he was not keeping any money in the bank. When he resigned, then some of his friend, MuhammadAli... He was also one of the prominent members. He asked, ""Mr. Das, what is your bank balance?"" So he replied, ""I do not know what is my bank balance, but I know I am debtor to the bank by twolakhs."" The bank was giving him credit, so this was his position. So my point is that when the... He fought his best that ""This resolution should be withdrawn, boycott of British court,"" but it was not done. But although he was very strong protester, still he had to do it. This is modern democracy. If the majority votes is in favor of something, even if I do not like it, I'll have to accept it. That is, of course, the so-called democracy. That..., we do not accept that. Our obedience is to the spiritual master. So in this way we should... If there is any misunderstanding, this should be adjusted and we should work wholeheartedly, because our responsibility is very great. We are trying to contribute something to the whole world. It is not a fashion. It is not a fashion. The whole world is suffering for want of God consciousness, so we are trying to give it to the world, God consciousness, in a systematic way, so that they may be highly benefited. So this is the purpose, but if there is some misunderstanding..."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:What is the actual disagreement?,Prabhupāda,"No, disagreement in the matter of process. You are thinking this way; he is thinking that way. That is the difference. Otherwise he is also eager to push onKṛṣṇaconsciousness; you are also. Yes."
