Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Vṛndāvanamorning walk,Vṛndāvana, April 2, 1976. Śrīla Prabhupāda is walking in theVṛndāvanaMunicipal Park this morning. He drove here by car in his Mercedes. Now he's taking walk here.",Prabhupāda,Car?
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Yes, car is locked, and the driver of the other car is watching it.",Prabhupāda,"[break] ...small park, they cannot maintain it."
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:...reading inCaitanya-caritāmṛta,the cleansing of theGuṇḍicātemple. And towards the end, one BengaliVaiṣṇavabrāhmaṇawashed the feet ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu, and He became a little angry, outwardly angry, and unhappy within. And in one purport you mention that the spiritual master should not be offered obeisances or have his feet washed before the Deity. But the impression of most of the devotees has been that in the presence of the spiritual master one can stop worshiping the Deity and offer obeisances to the spiritual master. So I was wondering which is correct.",Prabhupāda,(chuckles) Dilemma.
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:I mean, it's obvious if it was detrimental to our devotional service, then Prabhupāda would correct it.",Prabhupāda,"They cannot also keep clean even Central Park. Then what to speak ofVṛndāvana? Things are becoming very, very..."
Puṣṭa,PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:Here inVṛndāvanathe people also pay taxes?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, without tax.... [break]"
Tripurāri:,"Tripurāri:...in the day sometimes, and now they are givingprasādamto the devotees free, without charge. [break] ...stay?",Prabhupāda,They stay at theRādhā-Dāmodaratemple. (aside:)HareKṛṣṇa.
Tripurāri:,Tripurāri:Those are the originals?,Prabhupāda,(aside:)Jaya.Jaya.
keśava,"Ādi-[break] ...the devotees are asking one question. They're wanting to know how it was that even though there is so much distance between, let's say,GovardhanaandRādhā-kuṇḍaandVṛndāvana,Nanda-grāma, Varṣāṇā, how it was that stillKṛṣṇaandRādhācould go and meet, and the cowherd boys could go and meet at these various places. They could go such great distances.",Prabhupāda,"That is distance for you, not for them. Just like a small ant. It goes from here to here. It is a great, three hundred miles, but for you, one step. Why do you studyKṛṣṇalike you? Why do you think thatKṛṣṇawas like you?Avajānantimāṁmūḍhāmānuṣīṁtanumāśritam[Bg.9.11].Kṛṣṇacan do anything, so His associates."
