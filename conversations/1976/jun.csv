Reporter:,"Reporter:Ah, Swami. What is your purpose here with your ah.... with the faith in seeking the growth and so on.",Prabhupāda,(toRāmeśvara) That is the purpose you can explain.
Reporter:,"Reporter:Ah. How is..., how will this be achieved?",Prabhupāda,"Misery. Misery is caused due to ignorance. They admit or not. The more we are kept in darkness of knowledge, we suffer. What is the difference between ah..., what is called? Developed nations and not developed nations. This America belonged to the Red Indians. And because they are not developed, their condition was developed, ah, different from the present America. They could not construct such big, big house, and big, big roads, and like that because they are in ignorance. That is the difference. Prosperity, no prosperity. Happiness, not happiness. They are ignorance and knowledge."
Reporter:,Reporter:They have.... Is it that they have confused materialism with happiness?,Prabhupāda,"Not Material, I mean, I mean to say. Happiness is knowledge."
Reporter:,Reporter:Hmm.,Prabhupāda,"Happiness is knowledge. Man who is in ignorance, he is suffering, and that you say material and spiritually. A person who is not in developed consciousness, he is suffering. And they commit sinful acts also."
Reporter:,Reporter:I beg your pardon?,Prabhupāda,"They commit sinful acts also in ignorance. That is the difference between man and animal. Animal means not developed consciousness. They.... Some of them, they say the animal has no soul. That is foolishness. Animal has soul, but the consciousness is not developed. Just like a child. Father's consciousness and the child's consciousness different. Why it is different? The child's consciousness is not developed. Father's consciousness is developed. Because the child is talking some nonsense, you cannot say there is no soul. There is soul, but the consciousness is not developed."
Reporter:,Reporter:Do you see hope for mankind in the future?,Prabhupāda,Yes. Man can be happy immediately provided the consciousness is developed.
Reporter:,Reporter:Can.... Do you think that this will ever be achieved?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. It can be achieved. Just like I have sent a letter to your government asking them questions that you write on the bills: ""In God We Trust."" So is it that you trust in God blindly or knowingly? That was my question. Suppose I trust you. So you must be trustworthy. Otherwise why shall I trust you? So this question I asked the government: ""You write on the bills, 'In God We Trust,' so what kind of trust is this?"" If you actually trust, then you must know that God is trustworthy. Only blindly trust as a slogan. But that letter is not in reply. So what is your opinion? ""In God We Trust,"" but how do you trust, why you trust? This is my question."
Reporter:,"Reporter:It would be a matter of faith, I suppose.",Prabhupāda,"Faith may be different. You may have faith, I may not have faith. That is not the question. Just like in the bank you deposit some money. If some may have faith or no faith, but that bank is trustworthy. You know that your money deposited in the bank will not be cheated. Similarly if you trust in God, you must know whether God is trustworthy. Whether.... What do you mean by God? This is not the question of faith. Faith is bad. It is a question of understanding. So that we want, that America-specially you are favorite amongst all other nations; you are well-to-do, richer than other nations—so why don't you take God seriously? Why should you trust in God as faith? No, you understand what is God and have your faith at full, that ""God is, yes, trustworthy,"" so that others may also know that God is trustworthy. That is our mission, that why God entrust? Are we trusting God? Should we.... A slogan. Let it be a fact by scientific study, by scientific understanding. There is way to understand why God is trustworthy. It's not the question of faith. It is a fact."
Devotee:,Devotee:HareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,"Just like a child had..., has faith in his parents. So that is not an artificial thing, that is fact. And parents are trustworthy to the child. There is no doubt of..., by nature. So, similarly, why could..., you should be in trust in God? Why blindly? Why not trust with knowledge? And that is our movement. Every civilized person has got some faith in God. But now, they're advanced, they should understand what is God, why you must have faith in Him. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Reporter:,Reporter:It's a matter of education...,Prabhupāda,"Simply faith, blind faith we do not endure. And therefore they are becoming godless. And gradually, if we do not understand factually what is God, then the whole human civilization will be godless. To become godless means again animal. That is the difference between animal and man. In the animal society there is no question of religion, faith, God. These things are not there. The human civilization, if it becomes like that, without any faith in God, without any understanding of God, then where is the difference between cats and dogs and human beings? They must know God scientifically. That is the actual aim of human life. Suppose the dog is sleeping on the street without any care whether a car is coming and smash it. He's also sleeping sound sleep. And we are sleeping in a very nice apartment. So after all, sleeping. And he is also enjoying sleeping, I am also enjoying sleeping. So do you think to change the, I mean to say, circumstances of the sleeping? I am sleeping in a very nice apartment, he's sleeping on the floor. Does it mean this is advancement of civilization? Sleeping is sleeping. Eating is eating. Sex life—the male dog is enjoying with female dog. The sex pleasure is to him, and we are enjoying with a beautiful lover. The sex pleasure is the same. Therefore, you take some eatable, either on gold fork or an iron fork, the taste is the same. Simply like putting the foodstuff in the golden fork, does it mean the taste has changed? So, the test of eating, sleeping, mating and defending is the same for the human being as well as the animals. What difference, what is the difference between the animals and humans? The animal cannot know God. That is not possible. The human being can know. That is the opportunity of this human life. If we are missing that opportunity, then we are leading an animal civilization. This is not civilization. Animal life is not civilization. Civilized means not animal life. Something more than that. That is God consciousness."
Reporter:,Reporter:Do you have programs developed to educate mankind towards this God consciousness?,Prabhupāda,Yes. Concrete education. Not fictitious. Concrete.
Reporter:,"Reporter:How will you.... How would you get man to become aware of the situation so he could desire, even desire unconsciously?",Prabhupāda,"There is a very simply fact. It you simply understand that one verse in theBhagavad-gītā,there it is stated that Very simply thing. Just like the art of the material nature. Everything is coming out of the material nature, beginning from the grass to the highest intellectual human being or more than that. Wherefrom they are coming? From this material nature: ether, earth, water, fire. This element, some material nature. Let us see from the ground, the grass is coming, the vegetable is coming. From the water the fishes are coming, all the ants are coming, the germs are coming. Then, after eating that vegetable, the animals are coming. In this way everything is coming, generated from the earth, from the material nature. Is it not a fact?"
Reporter:,Reporter:Mmm!,Prabhupāda,"So, we are coming from material nature. That means we are..., material nature is our mother. From the womb of mother, the child comes from. So, from the material nature everything is coming. Therefore according to Vedic knowledge, this earth is also mother. We have got seven mothers according to Vedic civilization: Ātma-mātāmeans original mother, real mother. Andguroḥpatnī,the wife of teacher. The wife of abrāhmaṇa.Brāhmaṇameans the most intellectual class of men in the human society,brāhmaṇa.It is not acaste. It is a section in every human society. Always, there is a class of men very intelli..., intelligent. They are calledbrāhmaṇa.So,ātma-mātā,guroḥpatnī,brāhmaṇī,rāja-patnikā,and the queen—formerly there were kings—she is also considered mother. Anddhenumeans cow is mother because we drink her milk. She supplies milk. That's mother. Andpṛthvī,in the earth, we are coming out. Earth is mother. Really we see coming. And there may be different varieties of sons. That doesn't matter. But anything coming out the earth—the earth is mother—and that is coming out, that is son. Then where is the father? There must be father. Is it possible mother can give birth to a child without father?"
Reporter:,Reporter:Mm?,Prabhupāda,Is it possible?
Reporter:,Reporter:I wouldn't think so.,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Reporter:,Reporter:I wouldn't think so. No.,Prabhupāda,"So, there must be father. This is conclusion. So who is sanctioning about the father? The answer is in theBhagavad-gītā:ahaṁbīja-pradaḥpitā[Bg.14.4],""I am father."" You cannot denying father; that is not possible. If there is mother, if there is child, there must be father. This is human sense. And animal sense is: ""I don't care for father. There may be father, may not be..."" That is animal sense. So do you want to keep the human society in such ignorance just like cats and dogs? The dogs do not care who is father. This movement wants to give education to the human society: ""Yes, there is father."" And that is actual fact. Without father how there is child? Is it possible? Then? For at the present moment, the human society is child playing on the lap of mother, that's all. In big, big motorcars, that's all. Without any knowledge of father. But will the human being remain simply satisfied with toys on the lap of mother, or you'll try to understand who is father? So we are satisfied with the toys, and playing on the lap of the mother. The motorcar is running very swiftly, head-break or neck-break speed, and they are thinking they are civilized, advanced. What is.... ""Who is your father?"" ""Don't know."""
Rāmeśvara,"Then, where do you live?",Prabhupāda,Eh?
Rāmeśvara,Where do you.... Where do...?,Prabhupāda,"But, he lives on the lap of mother, that's all. That is child. Child is satisfied on the lap of the mother, that's what I am saying. He doesn't.... The child doesn't care, ""I have to know the father."" But there is father, that's a fact. That means the present civilization is childish civilization. Does not care to know the father. So, whether the human civilization will remain child, children. They fight amongst themselves. Children, however you can.... ""My dear children, live peacefully."" So for the time being they may be. Again they will fight, they will cry. That is going on. What the United Nations has done? For the last forty years, they're fighting like children or animals. So you keep..., if you keep them as child or animals, do you think there will be peace? That is not possible. It is to the talking of big, big words for peace. That is not possible. It is futile attempt. They're talking of big, big wars (indistinct), that is not possible. I think in Melbourne I, in my press interview, I said if the United Nations is working."
Ambarīṣa,"I just came from Vancouver from the Habitat Conference. The U.N. is having a Habitat Conference in Vancouver, and they (indistinct) is not united, their discussions and arguments. Sometimes there are walkouts, so many things, and they're not able to reach any conclusions, they can't agree with each other.",Prabhupāda,"How they can? Do you mean to say dogs simply barking, they will come to a conclusion? (chuckles) It is not possible. There is no aim, what is the actual aim of life. So this is very important movement. At least the intelligent class of men, they must understand it thoroughly. Just like there is body. There are different parts, different sections of the body, but the most important section is the brain. Similarly, the important section of society means one who is fully in God consciousness. I.... You can cut my hands, I shall live. You can cut my legs, I shall live. But if you cut my head, (indistinct). So, at the present moment, there are big, big scientists, big, big technologists. That's all right; that is hands and legs. But there is no brain. Therefore in one sense, you can take it as dead society. So in my opinion, I like your country, America. Sometimes I call, ""This is my fatherland,"" because these American boys, they are helping me pushing on this movement. I am very much obliged to these boys. Now, let us take it little more seriously statewise. And if America takes it seriously, other nations will follow. And there is the United Nations Organization in America. And make a nice organization to understand God. United Nations God Consciousness. People will benefit."
Reporter:,Reporter:Do you see America getting more God consciousness?,Prabhupāda,At least I see majority of my disciples are Americans. Why not expanding?
Rāmeśvara,"Prabhupāda, before Richard asked me a question: what is the difference between our movement and say another religion like the Sikhs or some other religion?",Prabhupāda,"Don't misunderstand. It is.... Religion, it means a kind of faith. Just like you are Christian, I amHindu. So you have faith in Christian religion, I have faith in Hin.... That is another thing. But this is.... We understand religion in a different way according to English dictionary. But real religion means the law given by God. This is the shortcut definition of religion. And if you do not know what is God, and if you do not know what is His law, then what is the meaning of religion? There is no meaning of religion. If blindly, if I have some faith in some dogmas and ritualistic ceremonies, that is not religion. Religion means the science by which you can understand God and the law of God. That is religion. It is not the kind of faith. Just like state laws. You may have faith or no faith. The state law is law; you have to obey it. Just like I have come in America. In our country, the street law is ""Keep to the left."" So I have come to America, you say ""Keep to the right."" If I say, ""No, I have no faith in this 'Keep to the right.' "" No, I must obey. That is law. Similarly, religion means you may have faith or no faith, but you must obey. It is a must. It is not optional. That is religion. That, I explained it many times that (indistinct) means characteristic. Just like everyone of us, we are servant. So, the living entity is servant. He may have faith or no faith, he must be a servant. And if you don't become servant of God, then you become servant of dog. That is your advancement of civilization. When there is no service for God, just like here we have got service for God, there is no question of serving dog. But when we forget service of God, then automatically we become service of dog. But service.... I am servant, that's a fact. And voluntarily keep a dog and serve him. They have no master, then I keep a master, dog, cat. You call it by the name, pet. What is a pet? I do service, that's all. So this is our advancement of civilization. We have refused to serve God, and you voluntarily accept to serve dog. Now in India, they are also learning. (chuckles) And formerly, dog keeping, dog there was in the neighborhood. But they were not allowed to enter the room or house. Now, they are keeping dogs just like the Western people keep. They are making dog show and so on, so on."
Rāmeśvara,Dog show.,Prabhupāda,They are learning how serve the dog. And they are giving up God.
Ambarīṣa,"Yeah, there are a lot of people here that worship their pets.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Rāmeśvara,The Russians served Lenin.,Prabhupāda,They are imitating. You understand people are very expert in this subject matter. They have come.... Learning everything.
Devotee (1):,Devotee (1):We can't avoid serving.,Prabhupāda,"No, that is not possible."
Rāmeśvara,"That's all there is in life, is service.",Prabhupāda,"Now we are sitting, so many gentlemen. He's having some paper, and you are serving God. The service is there. Nobody can say, ""No, I don't serve anyone."" Is there any man? No. That is not possible. You must serve. Constitutionally, you are meant for service, either you are president of the state or is anything. That is your position. That is the beginning ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu's philosophy,jīverasvarūpahayanitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa[Cc.Madhya20.108-109].All living entities are eternal servant of God."
Ambarīṣa,And all service is the same?,Prabhupāda,Eh?
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):No. He says, ""All service is the same.""",Prabhupāda,How can it be? All service is the same? Do you think...
Ambarīṣa,"Everybody serves in their own way, but it's all...",Prabhupāda,"That is.... Unless you come to the service of God, it is wrong."
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):I think he's asking, ""But if it is service to God, then in God's eyes, all service to Him.""",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Reporter:,Reporter:Right.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. God, service to God means, just like you put foodstuff in the stomach. Then the service, supplying energy, is distributed automatically. The eyes get service, the ears get service, the hands get service, legs get service, everything. But if you put foodstuff in the eyes, instead of giving service, you make it blind. If you put foodstuff in the ear, instead of hearing, it is blocked. Then that is ignorance. You do not know where to give service. The knowledge, God consciousness, means to know where to give service, so that the service will be automatically distributed. You pour water on the root of the tree and the energy will be distributed to the trunk, to the branches, to the twigs, to the leaves, to the flowers, everyone. We are missing their point. This is scientific, So instead of giving service in so many ways—social, political, philosophical, cultural, this way, that way—if you simply learn how to serve God, then everything will be done. So that is our philosophy, and we are laboring for this purpose, that you understand God and give service to Him, then the whole society will be perfect, peaceful."
Devotee (1):,"Devotee (1):You asked earlier about our program for educating society, are you still interested in this?",Prabhupāda,This education is all explained.
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):I think he was interested also techniques by which we go about educating society. We have some techniques which...,Prabhupāda,Technical knowledge is not education.
Devotee (2):,"Devotee (2):No, but I mean, as far as our books are.... We have our techniques for educating society.",Prabhupāda,Oh!
Rāmeśvara,Our program is to distribute the books of theVedaswith our spiritual master's philosophical commentaries. We already discussed a little bit before we came.,Prabhupāda,"And all this subject matter, everything, sixty-two books already."
Devotee (2):,Devotee (2):Jaya!,Prabhupāda,HareKṛṣṇa. (end)
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:While I was in New York, I've been going to the United Nations building there, and there's a organization called ECOSOC, the Economic and Social Council. It's made up of the members of the U.N. and I think there's very good chance that our society can be represented amongst this group as a nongovernmental organization, which means that in various matters which the council discusses, we would be a consultive group and we would be able to present statements as well as literature on how to solve..., on our viewpoint on how to solve various problems facing the council. And these would be distributed to all the United Nations representatives.",Prabhupāda,"As soon as you say ""God,"" they will reject."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Well, actually, one of the things which this council handles is freedom of religion throughout the world.",Prabhupāda,"That means they do not believe in God. Freedom of religion means whatever you like, you do."
Hṛdayānanda,Yes. That's a fact.,Prabhupāda,That is going on. Religion is not very important.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:No. It's not one of their major considerations.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. How to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex, that is their consideration. Animal activities."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:But one advantage of this is that all of the.... Just like they make a lot of studies of various countries.,Prabhupāda,"""Studies"" means if they do not take the science of God as the most important items. Then they'll say: ""Yes, you have freedom, you can do. I have got my freedom."""
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yeah. They make a lot of information available on the.... In other words, it'll help oursaṅkīrtanamovement because they make inquiries into the freedom of an individual, for example, to.... As we want to distribute literature in various countries, they have so much facts and figures on where that would be possible.",Prabhupāda,"And the newsreel will say that thissaṅkīrtanamovement is nuisance, it is disturbance. Then what they'll do?"
Rāmeśvara,There's also some respectability if we become connected with...,Prabhupāda,That is all right.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:It's prestigious, and it also allows us to have a lot of information available. Just like, as we're finding out, for example,RāmeśvaraMahārājais working with our lawyer here, and we find that we have the legal right to distribute in airports. Legally, we have the right. Similarly, there are legal rights for oursaṅkīrtanamovement in various countries in the world, and through this group we would get access to all information on what the legal position is and other things of this kind.",Prabhupāda,"Harernāma[Cc. Ādi17.21].Yes, that's nice."
Rāmeśvara,"(Maharishi Mahesh)Yogi, he tried to file a trademark on the words ""Transcendental Meditation"" with the United States government. So we protested that actually he cannot claim that he is teaching transcendental meditation, what to speak of prohibiting anyone else from using those words. So they accepted our claim and kicked out his application.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Bharadvāja:,"Bharadvāja:Yesterday you gave an example of a man who was lying asleep in bed, and he is transported somewhere in dream, walking on the beach. What is the full...? Because we're going to try to make an exhibit of it. So what is the full analogy? Is he actually going to another place by his mind, he's actually transported?",Prabhupāda,"The soul is going there. The seer is the same in this gross body or in the subtle bodies. I am in the, walking in this gross body, I'm seeing this ocean, and I will leave my gross body in dream, I go to India. So the seer is the same. That is the proof of transmigration. He's dreaming tiger, and he's crying, ""Here is a tiger, tiger, tiger,"" and another man, who is seer of the body, he says, ""Where is tiger?"" So this is the difference. One is seeing through this gross body, another seeing through the subtle body, but the seer is the same. Transmigration of the soul means, when he's seeing through.... That is practical. The child, when he's seeing through the childish body, he's talking nonsense. The same soul, when he's talking as an elderly person, he's talking beautiful (indistinct). The seer is the same, simply the glass is changed. Sometimes blue, sometimes red. [break] Seer is the same, medium is different. That you have.... And dead body means the seer is no longer there. It has entered another body. [break]"
Pradyumna,"...when someone is sleeping and dreaming, that the seer has left the gross body?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, yes."
Bharadvāja:,"Bharadvāja:How does the.... Life symptoms, how are the life symptoms maintained in the body?",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Bharadvāja:,Bharadvāja:The life symptoms are maintained in the body still?,Prabhupāda,"No, life symptoms, there is not. The body's fit; therefore, he comes back again. When the body is not fit, he enters another body. Just like your car you leave. We have come here. Now the car is all right; we go. If it is useless, we don't go. We take another."
Hṛdayānanda,That is like leaving the motor running.,Prabhupāda,"They, unless the seer returns back, the body will lie down. That is death. The seer no more comes back. Then it is dead."
Hṛdayānanda,"Yes, sometimes a man dies in his sleep.",Prabhupāda,It is dead.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:So sleeping is like temporary death.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. All deaths are temporary. When you change bodies, you die for seven months. This death is for few hours, and that is for seven months. That's all."
Bharadvāja:,Bharadvāja:What happens when he dreams of the spiritual master orKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda,That's all right. Dreaming means he's seeing. The seer is the same.
Rādhāvallabha:,Rādhāvallabha:In Hawaii you were saying that they take rest for six months and wake up a dog.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. (laughter) [break] ...a small garden like this, that is called a hanging garden."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes, we can walk there in the mornings.",Prabhupāda,Hm.
Bharadvāja:,"Bharadvāja:Śrīla Prabhupāda, chantingHareKṛṣṇais considered to be the watering process, and sometimes from chanting, the weeds, from watering, the weeds also grow along with devotional service—the weeds of different desires. I don't understand how it is possible that from chanting that these weeds grow.",Prabhupāda,"Chanting is purifying all material desires. It will take, gradually.Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12].If you are chanting without any offense, then your heart will be cleansed of all material contamination.Harernāma[Cc. Ādi17.21]."
Bharadvāja:,Bharadvāja:So pulling out the weeds means avoiding the offenses in chanting the holy name.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So long we'll have material desires, we'll have to accept a material body and fulfill the desires."
Mahendra,"Sometimes, although a devotee understands that he must take birth again if he does not, if he is not strict, he thinks, ""Oh, it is so difficult to be strict. Maybe I'll just take it easy and remain engaged in devotional service, then I'll take another birth as a devotee and maybe next time I'll finish up my business.""",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.He gets good opportunity of material enjoyment, and then take birth in good family, aristocratic orbrāhmaṇa.Then where he ended in last life, he begins again. There is a verse:paurva-dehikam.Paurva-dehikammeans previous birth."
Mahendra,"It seems, though, that in that respect, he's gambling.",Prabhupāda,Gambling?
Mahendra,"Yes, he's gambling, that he's thinking that ""Oh, next life I will come back in a better condition,"" but his next might be different.",Prabhupāda,Why should he desire like that? That means he has not understood what is meant byKṛṣṇaconsciousness.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. One who understands wants to get out in this lifetime.,Prabhupāda,Hm?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:One who understandsKṛṣṇaconsciousness should want to finish the business of material life.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, therefore he's required to readBhagavad-gītāthoroughly. It is said clearly, ""This is a place of misery."" Why do you desire to keep yourself in this.... That means you do not understand what is spiritual life."
Hari,Hari-śauri:Still thinking he's this body.,Prabhupāda,"Thinking. Thinking, he's under the influence ofmāyā.māyāis dictating, ""Why you are trying to go away? Come on, here,SantaMonica."" (laughter) And when you become detestful either thisSantaMonica or any Monica, ""I am not interested,"" then your spiritual life is..."
Jagannātha,"Jagannātha-suta:Yes, we have those plaques hanging up in the Press building now.",Prabhupāda,"Hm. Bring it, I shall see."
Puṣṭa,"PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa:[break] ...diminution on this path of devotional service,nehābhikrama-nāśo'sti[Bg.2.40].So does that mean that once one enters the material world, there's only progress in going back to Godhead, although it may be slow, over many lifetimes?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Yes. One is going slow, one is finishing very rapidly. If one is serious, he can finish very rapidly. If one is not serious, it will take time."
Rāmeśvara,[break] ...contests and get all sorts of awards and recognition. Because no one has such beautiful books.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, that's a fact."
Rāmeśvara,"We have also won awards forBack to Godhead,the cover design.",Prabhupāda,Cover designs?
Rādhāvallabha:,"Rādhāvallabha:Śrīla Prabhupāda, at the time of death, when the soul leaves the body, at that time the body is destroyed. So at the time of sleeping, when the soul leaves the body, how is the body maintained?",Prabhupāda,Hmm?
Rādhāvallabha:,"Rādhāvallabha:At the time of sleeping, when the soul leaves the body, why is the body not destroyed at that time?",Prabhupāda,Why? Suppose you have left the car; does that mean it is destroyed? You are going again.
Rādhāvallabha:,Rādhāvallabha:But at the time of death it is destroyed when you leave it.,Prabhupāda,"Death is different. When the car is no more usable, that is death. But we are returning to the car because we know that it is usable. And if we know that it is useless, we don't go to that car. That is death."
Yadubara:,"Yadubara:Śrīla Prabhupāda. At the time of sleeping, there is a subtle reality that the subtle body enters into?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Reality means as you take this awakening vision as reality, similarly, the dream vision is also real.... Nothing, none of them are reality. They are all temporary."
Yadubara:,Yadubara:But that subtle reality is just as real as this gross reality?,Prabhupāda,Yes. They'll not stay. This reality will not stay.
Hari,Hari-śauri:It's all a dreamlike existence.,Prabhupāda,"Yes, simply a long duration dream. Do you think this skyscraper building will stay? Nothing will stay. It may stay for five hundred years or five thousand years. But is it not permanent. Anything you take—the trees, this land, nothing; even this ocean.Bhūtvābhūtvāpralīyate[Bg.8.19].It appears again and again disappears, that's all. Everything. The material world means that.Bhūtvābhūtvāpralīyate. Vyaktāvyaktam.Sometimes manifested, sometimes not manifested. This town is manifested, and one big wave of sea, it will be nonmanifested, immediately."
Yadubara:,Yadubara:So that subtle reality is existing side by side with this gross reality.,Prabhupāda,Reality is in the spiritual world. This is imitation reality. Real reality is in the spiritual world.
Hari,"Hari-śauri:We have to go left here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (pause) The material universes are like a produce ofMahā-Viṣṇu.",Prabhupāda,"A big dream, that's all. Material existence means a big dream. How long you'll dream? So long you are in this body. And as long as the body is finished, your dream is finished. Your nation, your society, your friends, your money, your bank, everything finished. Is it not a dream? Then dream another—you become cats and dogs or demigods. You dream in a different way. You are now dreaming as American; next life you may dream something else."
Bharadvāja:,Bharadvāja:So every man has his own world that he's living in?,Prabhupāda,"Eh? He creates his own world. Nothing is own—temporary—he creates, andKṛṣṇagives him the opportunity, ""All right, you enjoy.""Harenāma,harenāma."
Rāmeśvara,"There's some connection still.

So then he told other scientists about it, and they looked in their telescopes, and sure enough, there it was. But it wasn't as big as he said, nor was it as heavy as he said, nor was it as far away as he said, and when they rechecked the <a href=""/d/data"" class=""d"">data</a> they found that the orbit of the original planet wasn't really wrong either. So all of his calculations were wrong, but still the planet was there. So somehow or other he stumbled upon it, but all of his calculations to find it were absolutely wrong. That's the planet called Pluto.</div>
