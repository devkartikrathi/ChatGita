Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:The first thing about this... Can you tell me something about Lord Caitanya's birth, when He was born, what happened, what was it like, all about it.",Prabhupāda,When He was...? Description of His birth?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Well, we will have a scene showing the people chanting by the...""",Prabhupāda,"One scene you have to show that in the Ganges water people are taking bath, and there is on the sky beginning of the moon eclipse, lunar eclipse. And they are all chantingHareKṛṣṇaand taking bath. And exactly at that timeCaitanyaMahāprabhuappeared. This is one scene. And the appearance ofCaitanyaMahāprabhushould be underneath a tree. Under this scene, this scene, one...AdvaitaPrabhu's wife, Śrīvāsa's wife, they were elderly, and all other women of the village, they immediately came with presentation. And some of the demigods, they also came, I mean to say, disguising themselves as ordinary men, with presentation. And His father got so many valuable presentations. And then again, some of the professional dancers, they came. So he distributed charity to them. In this way, that function... Try to..."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:WasNāradathere? DidNāradaMunicome?,Prabhupāda,"Yes.NāradaMunialso came. You can show that. Yes. all thedevatas,all the demigods came.NāradaMuni,Brahmā, Śiva. They came in disguise, and their wife,Savitri, and thenUmā.Umāis the wife of Lord Śiva. In that way you can show so many demigods and their wives coming. Yes."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:All the women, when LordCaitanyawas a baby, how did they feel about Him?",Prabhupāda,"The baby was on the lap of His mother, and they looked little far-off, just to glance over the baby, not touching. Because newly born baby. So they saw from little distant. That's all. And the baby was very beautiful. He was golden complexion. And His grandfather was a great astrologer, His mother's father,NīlāmbaraCakravartī. He immediately calculated His horoscope, constellation of the stars under which He was born. He calculated that ""This boy will be a great reformer."""
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:What is the position of astrology inKṛṣṇaconsciousness?,Prabhupāda,"Astrology is a science.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness has nothing to do with astrology, but it is the general custom that as soon as a child is born the astrologers come. That is the Indian system, Vedic system."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:LordCaitanya, He would cry so that He could hear them chantingHareKṛṣṇato Him?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. That was not on that day, but when He was little grown up. As soon as He would cry, so the neighboring friends of His mother, all young girls would come and chantHareKṛṣṇaand He'll stop. Sometimes they would tease Him so that He may cry, and they'll see that He's crying, and they'll chantHareKṛṣṇa, and He'll stop. Again tease. (laughs) So thatCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas preachingHareKṛṣṇachanting by His childhood activities."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:What are some of the things that He did when He was a little boy? Some tricks or things?,Prabhupāda,"Sometimes He would play with snakes. One day, when He was crawling in the courtyard... Indian house... As, just like here is compound outside. In Indian house there is courtyard inside. So He was crawling in the yard, and a snake came, a snake. And He began to play with the snake. The snake will do like this and crawling, and He would see it, He wouldstrike. In this way the snake was playing and the mother became so much afraid. They cannot touch. If the snake bites... So they simply saw that the child is playing with the snake, and after some time the snake went away. And they took up the child, ""Oh, God has saved this child, otherwise He would have been killed. Such a venomous, big snake."""
Govinda,Govindadāsī:It was a big snake? Very big? And was it Śeṣa?,Prabhupāda,"That is another thing. It may be understood that he was Śeṣa, but that was the incident. And another incident is that when He was just walking... So it is the system that small children, they are decorated with ornaments here, here, bangle, so many ornaments, here. So one thief saw that... He stole away the child. So he was seeking some secret place, lonely place, so that he can rob of... In this way seeking, seeking, he traveled, and at last he came just in front of the house, and he dropped the child, that ""Somebody may see that I have taken this child. Then I'll be beaten, I will be caught."" So out of fear he fled away. And the guardians, ladies, they were very much anxious, ""Who has taken the child? He was with ornaments."" But they saw that the child is there. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuenjoyed for some time on the shoulder of the thief."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Were they liberated souls? The thief?,Prabhupāda,"At least, afterCaitanyaMahāprabhu's getting on their shoulders, (laughs) they must have been liberated. No flower? Bring some flower."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:He would sometimes eat clay?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That was when He was about three years old. So generally, for morning the children given nicesandeṣa,sweetmeat, and this puffed rice in a cane pot and He would eat. ButCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas eating clay. So His mother said, ""Oh, why You are eating clay?"" Then He said, ""What is the difference between clay and this foodstuff? After all, everything is clay. It is produced from clay."" This is criticizing theMāyāvādīphilosophy that everything is one. So His mother said, ""My dear boy, it is very nice, everything is clay. But when you have to use for practical purpose... For example, if you want to keep water, so you have to keep water on the clay pot, not on the clay. So this specific form of the clay is required."" Then He said, ""Mother, you have taught Me very nice philosophy. I shall not eat any more clay."" Sometimes He would sit in some nasty place where pots, clay pots... In India still, the system is, for cooking purpose, for the Deity, every day a new clay pot should be used. In Jagannath temple still it is. No used pot can be accepted. So after using, the rejected pots are stacked in some place. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas sitting on the rejected pots. So His mother said, ""My dear boy, You are sitting in this nasty place. Why?"" He said, ""Well, how you can say this is nasty place? These pots are very pure."" Hm? [break]"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:That's all right. You know, we will need a harmonium. Should I wait till we get to India to purchase one?",Prabhupāda,You haven't got in New York?
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:They have one in New York temple. Los Angelessaṅkīrtananeeds a harmonium, a good harmonium. Maybe...",Prabhupāda,Can you spare hundred dollars?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Right now...,Prabhupāda,You get hundred dollars; then we shall get.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Okay. Wakim and Son?(?),Prabhupāda,"No, from elsewhere."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Moremṛdaṅgas.,Prabhupāda,"These boys,Acyutānanda, they do not write what they are doing, what they are not doing. I do not know whether they have made a plan to go away from the society and live independently."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:It seems like it is very difficult to go to India without you and still come back. It seems...,Prabhupāda,No. When we go to India I shall go with you. Yes. We must go.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. We can go toJagannāthaPurī?,Prabhupāda,Everywhere we shall go.
Govinda,"Govindadāsī:""Mother, these pots are very, are pure.""",Prabhupāda,"He,CaitanyaMahāprabhu, taught that anything in relationship withKṛṣṇa, it is not impure. That was His purpose. ""You should not treat these pots as impure. Ordinarily, when such pots are used for household purposes, that may be impure. But because in these potsprasādamwere prepared, that is not impure."" That was His... (pause)"
Govinda,Govindadāsī:I don't know what letters you want.,Prabhupāda,There is one letter from... Let me see.
Govinda,Govindadāsī:From Karandhara?,Prabhupāda,"No. We don't hear anything about, from Śivānanda."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:In Berlin?Kṛṣṇadāsa?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Is he in Berlin yet? IsKṛṣṇadāsain Berlin?Kṛṣṇadāsa.,Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇadāsaand that German boy.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Uttamaśloka.,Prabhupāda,Uttamaśloka.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:CanUttamaślokacome withsaṅkīrtana?,Prabhupāda,When you go there.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:When we go to Berlin.,Prabhupāda,"(pause) Hm. Very good. So if we go, there will be good reception in Bombay."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Labor of love.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You love something and unnecessarily you labor. So religion means... This is religion, how to develop love of God. That is religion."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Also there is a story in theBhāgavatamabout the girls; they were offering to Lord Śiva.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is another feature of LordCaitanya. He taught in that instruction that there is no need of worshiping demigods. The incident is that in India the unmarried girls, they are encouraged to worship Lord Śiva especially in the month ofVaiśākha,March-April. And they will go to the Ganges side and prepareŚivaliṅga,and they'll... That means Śiva will be pleased upon them to offer a husband like Lord Śiva. Śiva is very peaceful and very great devotee and most powerful at the same time. So that is the ideal husband. So they brought worshipable paraphernalia for worshiping Śiva on the bank of the Ganges, andCaitanyaMahāprabhu, as naughty boy, approached them. ""Oh, my dear sister, what you are doing? Oh, you have brought so many nice things. Give it to Me, and Lord Śiva will be very much pleased. Oh, you are worshipingDurga? She is My maidservant and Lord Śiva is a great devotee of Me. So you please offer Me all these things; they will be satisfied. You don't require to offer separately."" By this, He wanted to instruct that worshiping the Supreme Lord is the appeasement of other demigods. You don't require to appease them separately. This instruction. Then some girls will hesitate. Then He will curse them that ""You'll be married with an old man having seven children by his former wife."" So they will be afraid, ""Oh, maybe this boy is cursing..."" Then out of fear they'll offer. Then He said, ""Oh, you'll have a very nice young husband and you'll have seven children by him."" In this way it was going on."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:LordCaitanyais always doing this on a planet in the material, some material universe? These girls... All of these pastimes are eternal pastimes.",Prabhupāda,"Hm? No. These are not eternal pastimes. They are instructive particularly for this planet. In the eternalVaikuṇṭha, LordCaitanyais engaged in chanting and dancing. That's all."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Maybe you should, you must have your massage now. It's time.",Prabhupāda,What is time?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:It is twenty-five minutes to uh... Maybe we can do a little more. Twenty-five minutes to twelve. Maybe a tiny bit more.,Prabhupāda,"You can do, you can ask me for fifteen minutes more."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Okay. We also wish to show a scene of LordCaitanyain school, learning. Some kind of incident about how nice a pupil He was so we can show people that He was the best student in the school.",Prabhupāda,"In India the system is in the school that the best student is appointed... What is called in English? The chief student is called ""minor,"" or... ""M,"" beginning."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Monitor.,Prabhupāda,"Monitor, yes. Monitor. So He was monitor. That is the same. And He'll teach the students from grammar allKṛṣṇa.Dhātu.Dhātu.There is subject matter.Dhātumeans verb. So He will ex-plain...dhātumeans, when adhātuis taken away a man is dead, and thisdhātuisKṛṣṇa. SoKṛṣṇais the life. WithoutKṛṣṇaa man is dead."" In this way He explained.Kṛṣṇaexplanation."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:How old was He?,Prabhupāda,"I may say, eight or ten years old."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:I think that what we will try to do is have Birbhadra come with us and he will play LordCaitanyaas a boy.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That will be nice. And he is a very intelligent boy. He'll pick up.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Are there any other, any other nice incidences between this time and when LordCaitanyagot married?",Prabhupāda,"In childhood there are many incidents. Another incident... That is a very important incident. When He was very small, crawling, so onebrāhmaṇacame as their guest. And thebrāhmaṇa,after preparing food, when he would offer toKṛṣṇa, this boy, a child, crawling and take theprasādaand eat. And thebrāhmaṇawill cry, ""Oh, everything is spoiled. This boy, child has touched."" Then His father would request him, ""I should take care of Him. Please cook again and offer toKṛṣṇa."" He said, ""It is too late now. I'll eat some fruits."" ""No. Please cook."" So twice He spoiled in that way. Then it became night, so all the ladies, they went to sleep with the child and locked the door of the room. And at night at about eleven o'clock thebrāhmaṇa,when he was offering toKṛṣṇa, and the child came and took theprasādam.Thebrāhmaṇaagain began to cry, ""Oh, here again the child has come. How you are taking care?"" And nobody heard him because everyone was sleeping. One letter is left here?"
Govinda,"Govindadāsī:Ah, yes. I got that. I got that one out. It was from Bombay.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Keep that. So then He appeared as... No. As boy He talked with him that ""You are asking Me to come and take, and I am taking, and you are... Why you are howling like that? What can I do? You are asking Me."" Then He showed him that He isKṛṣṇaHimself and warned him that ""Don't disclose this fact. You are My devotee; therefore I disclose. So you were asking Me, so I came."" Then thebrāhmaṇawas so satisfied that ""Kṛṣṇa is here,"" and he did not disclose."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Maybe we will show Lord Caitanya's marriage? Is that nice to show?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Marriage. Yes, that is nice. The Indian system, marriage, is that the bridegroom goes to the house of the bride with procession, band, nicely decorated. They'll go... And He'll be married with first Lakṣmīpriyā, the first wife. There will be fireworks in the marriage ceremony. Yes."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:That will be very nice in this...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You can make band, fireworks, decoration, and feasting..."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Kīrtana.,Prabhupāda,"So many ladies, like that. That scene, I shall direct how to do it.CaitanyaMahāprabhu's father was not very rich man. So there was a bigzamindar.He was devotee of LordKṛṣṇa. So he had some affection forCaitanya. So when the marriage ceremony was being settled up, he said, ""Oh, His marriage shall not be just like thebrāhmaṇas'marriage.""Brāhmaṇa'swife, they are poor; so there is no expenditure. Some way or other, his marriage is done. But especiallykṣatriyasand thevaiśyas,oh, they spend lakhs of rupees in marriage. So he said that ""His marriage will not take place just like thebrāhmaṇas.His marriage will be royal marriage."" So he spent all the money, and there was grand, everything grandeur."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Then His wife, she died?",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:So His mother was feeling...,Prabhupāda,"Yes.CaitanyaMahāprabhuwent to East Bengal for teaching, and actually, the girl felt too much separation, and she died. And figuratively it is used that the separation took the form of a serpent and bitten her and she died. And when He came back His mother requested that ""You should marry for the second time,"" and He agreed. And so next marriage was withViṣṇupriyā. In the first marriage, Lakṣmīpriyā, He used to see her when she was bathing in the Gangesghāṭa,andCaitanyaMahāprabhudesired that ""I shall marry this girl."" So His father sent one matchmaker. So when the matchmaker came to His mother that ""Such and suchbrāhmaṇa...""I forget his name, but the name is there in theCaitanya-Bhāgavata.""He desires that his daughter should be married with your son."" And Śacīdevī said, ""Oh, my son is not yet grown up. He's just a student. How He can be married?"" So she practically denied. And the matchmaker was going back, not very satisfied. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas entering home. He saw the matchmaker and asked, ""No, why did you come here?"" ""Yes, I came to propose Your marriage with such and such daughter, but Your mother is not willing."" ""Oh, mother is not willing? All right. You can go."" Then when He came, entered home, He asked mother, ""Mother, what did you do? That matchmaker was going very sorry. Why? What did you say?"" The mother could understand that He is willing for the marriage. Then she called back the matchmaker. ""Yes. I agree for the marriage."" So the marriage ceremony... SoCaitanyaMahāprabhugave hint that ""I want to marry that girl."""
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Maybe we can do a nice scene withCaitanyaMahāprabhuand His friends' sojourn, I mean, they do have a nice time.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:They can do...,Prabhupāda,"It is simply adjustment. You can make very nice scene. Everything can be done nice, provided we arrange for that."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes.Nara-nārāyaṇa, he is very good at building scenery. He can do all of that very quickly.",Prabhupāda,So you'll play in the stage or make studio?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Better that we play either in a big area so we can be right in the middle of people. People will be all around.,Prabhupāda,Oh yes. That will be very nice.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Because then we include them.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That is the system. That is calledjātrāin India. That is very good system. There is no stage, but by words and feelings everyone becomes absorbed, and chanting. So that will be very nice."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. We will havekīrtana,maybe seven to tenkīrtanasin the play, so everybody will be joining in.",Prabhupāda,Yes. And they'll be asked to join.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Oh yes.,Prabhupāda,That will be very nice.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Even maybe when LordCaitanyasays toNityānandaPrabhuand to...,Prabhupāda,"No, when singing is there, all the players and all the audience and everyone will sing. That will be very nice."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. Even maybe LordCaitanyasays toNityānandaPrabhu, ""Go to all the people and tell them aboutKṛṣṇa."" So at that moment, we all, all thebrahmacārīs,we go into the people and we talk. Then we come back and tell LordCaitanya. We can preach too.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:So it's, it's fifteen.",Prabhupāda,All right.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Can you tell me something about Caitanya's initiation inVaiṣṇavafaith? When He was initiated?,Prabhupāda,"After His father's death it is the custom amongst the Hindus to offer oblations atGayā. There is a temple,Viṣṇutemple. They offerprasādam.This is aHinducustom. And with thatprasādamthe forefathers and the father is offered. So He went to perform that ceremony and by chance He met ĪśvaraPurīand He was initiated by ĪśvaraPurī. And after coming back fromGayā, He became very much emotional forKṛṣṇa, and sometimes people thought that He has become crazy. So His mother treated with some oil. But learned devotees, they said that He has got devotional emotion. So His initiation was inGayā, when He went to perform that ceremony. So you can show theGayātemple or some temple. And He's offering oblations, He's meeting His spiritual master, he's initiating. In this way you can make it two, three scenes. And He became emotional chantingHareKṛṣṇaafter initiation."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:The scenery will be very simple.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes, yes. That I know. That's all right. There is no need of scenery."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:We can do it by pantomime and gestures.,Prabhupāda,That's alright.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:That way, no matter where we are, people will understand.",Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes. That is nice.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:He would swoon whenever He heard Kṛṣṇa's name? He would be swooning? LordCaitanyawould faint?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, yes."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:It says in theTeachings of LordCaitanyathat He revealed His heavenly powers to His associates.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. That was done in one day,saṅkīrtana.He asked His devotees aftersaṅkīrtana,""What do you want to eat?"" So some of the devotees out of fun said that ""We want mango."" But that was not mango season. So He asked somebody, ""All right. Bring some mango seed."" So mango seed can be had in Bengal in everywhere because after eating mangoes they throw it, and gradually they become a small plant. So He brought some small plant mango and immediately sowed it on the courtyard, and immediately it became a big tree and full of mango."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:That would be a nice time for us to distributeprasādato all the people.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. If possible, mangoes."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Oh, yes. From the tree. We'll have them hung on the tree and pick.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. You have got nice ideas. You can do very nicely. Yes. This is required, creative ideas."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Maybe... About Lord Caitanya's civil disobedience. That is with theKazi?His civil disobedience?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:That is theKazi.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:I read the introduction. There is a lot of material on it. Maybe some other things that we can...,Prabhupāda,"You can make scene that people, His disciples, are performingkīrtanaand one scene you can makeKazi,Muslim magistrate, is sitting, and thebrāhmaṇas,they come. ""Sir, you are our protector. You areKazi.You are magistrate. And thisNimāiPaṇḍita, young boy, He is creating so much disturbance."" ""What is that?"" ""He has begun this chantingHareKṛṣṇa. This is not ourHindureligion. He is chanting so loudly. Now this is the time God is sleeping. So He'll be disturbed. So the whole society will be vanquished if God becomes angry. So He'll be disturbed."" SoKazi...After all, Hindus are complaining. SoKazisaid, ""All right, I am taking steps."" So he sent some officers. And they were playingmṛdaṅga,and warned that ""You cannot do this. You are disturbing here."" That is going on still. Just like our Los Angeles, it is going on. In New York also, they complain to theKazi,(laughs) police officer. But they could not do anything. So this complaint is going on since the inauguration of thesaṅkīrtanamovement. SoKazifirst of all warned. Then He did not care. Then the police also came and broke themṛdaṅgasforcibly. ThenCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""All right. We shall start thousands of men playingmṛdaṅga,and we shall go to the house ofKazi.Let us see what can he do."" So He went with many followers, and many followers playingmṛdaṅga,andKazibecame afraid that ""The people have become agitated."" So he fled away. Then the people began to create disturbance in his garden.CaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""Don't do this."" ThenKazicame back, andKaziwas very submissive, and he said, ""My dearNimāi, You are in relationship my nephew."" Because Hindus and Muslims in those days, although they had different religions, they had no animosity. They were living very friendly. So the Muslim elderly man will be said by the Hindus asChāchā.And the Muslims they'll callṬhākura Mosai.Like that. Friendly terms. They will invite. In this way they were living. So theKazisaid that ""Your grandfather, I call himChāchā.He's elderly man. So Your mother is my sister. So You are my nephew. So do you think a nephew can be very angry upon his uncle?"" And (chuckling) He said, ""No, nephew must be obedient to the uncle. But do you think that uncle, when a nephew comes to his house, will not receive him?"" ""Oh yes. You are welcome. You are my nephew. You are my son."" In this way the past incidences forgotten. Then theysatdown. ThenCaitanyaMahāprabhuasked him, ""My dear uncle, what is your religion that you are killing father and mother?"" ""Why killing father and mother?"" ""Oh, you are killing cow, your mother. You are drinking milk. And oxen, he produces grains for you in the field; so he is your father. The father earns for the children, so he is producing grains. And mother gives milk; so cow is giving milk. So how is your religion that the father mother killing?"" Then he could understand thatCaitanyais marking on the cow killing by the Mohammedans. Then he said, ""Oh, this cow killing is also in yourHindureligion."" Then He said, ""How is that,Hindureligion cow killing?"" ""Oh, there is cow sacrifice."" Then He said that cow sacrifice is not like this. Cow sacrifice is giving new life to the old cow. That is cow sacrifi... It is not killing. And because at the present moment thebrāhmaṇasare not so qualified that they can give new life, therefore that sacrifice is now forbidden. He cited some verses from Vedic literature that cow sacrifice and horse sacrifice and to beget children by the younger brother of husband andsannyāsa,and offering oblations with meat, these things are forbidden. So that is past. This is... Now it has no significance. In this way, both of them were scholars. Then they compromised. Agreement was theKazigave order everyone of his descendants, that ""Nobody will check thissaṅkīrtanamovement."" So that order is being carried by their descendants still there in Nabadwip. TheKazihas got his tomb. He was a very big man."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:He became a devotee?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Devotee means he was not converted, but he became very admirer ofCaitanyaand he ordered that ""Caitanya can performsaṅkīrtanaanywhere. Nobody shall check."" So that order is still being carried out."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:We can do this in the dark with candles. Men playing drums, some people holding candles, marching to his house.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:And it will look very...,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Maybe... Can we show him after LordCaitanya(and) he talk, they both come out and everyone haskīrtanaor is this not correct?",Prabhupāda,"No, you can do that.Kīrtana,that's all right."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:I mean theKazi,he can be in thekīrtana?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Out of jubilation, yes. That's all right."
Govinda,Govindadāsī:Did he stop this cow killing thereafter? After talking withCaitanyaMahāprabhu?,Prabhupāda,"No. Because that is their religious ceremony.Caitanyasimply criticized their process, but he replied that ""In Your Vedic there is cow sacrifice.""CaitanyaMahāprabhureplied, ""That sacrifice is not killing. That's giving new life."" So that much."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Madhudvisa, he will play theKazi.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Madhudvisa...,Prabhupāda,That's all right.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:So we can show His mother and His wife crying because He is takingsannyāsa.They see Him in His...,Prabhupāda,"No, no. He tooksannyāsaby previous arrangement. One day He went away from home, accompanied byMurāriand LordNityānanda, and went to Katwa. There was oneMāyāvādīsannyāsī,KeśavaBhāratī, and He tooksannyāsafrom him. And then He was, in emotion He was going toVṛndāvana, but He was misled byNityānanda, and He was brought to the home ofAdvaita, andAdvaitaarranged to bring His mother to see Him for the last. So His mother and many people from Nabadwip came to Sant... Advaita's house was in Santipur. So there was, for a few days,CaitanyaMahāprabhustayed there, andsaṅkīrtanaandprasādadistribution was going on. And His mother feeling, feeling very well... ButCaitanyaMahāprabhusaw that ""My mother is not allowing Me to go. That is not good."" So He requested, ""Mother, I have takensannyāsī.If I go on feasting like this with mother, what people will say? So you give Me permission to go."" So mother said, ""Yes, my dear boy. You have takensannyāsī.But anyway You are happy. That is my happiness. But my only request is that You make Your headquarters atJagannāthaPurī. Because people from Nabadwip generally go there, so I shall get at least Your news. That is my last desire."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""Yes. I shall make My headquarters inPurī."" So people were coming and going. So His mother was getting news ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu. That was then last days. ButCaitanyaMahāprabhu, after that incident, never met, either His mother... And there was no question of meeting with wife."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:No. So Jānakī, she can play the mother. She is...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. And you can show another scene that His wife,Viṣṇupriyā, she was chantingHareKṛṣṇa, and one round finished, she counted it with one grain of rice. One round finished, one grain rice. So as many rounds finished, she'll eat only so much rice. That's all."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Wow. He did that?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:He did that all the time?,Prabhupāda,Yes. That was... From 16 years till death she was doing that.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:I thought He sometimes would eat a room full of food?,Prabhupāda,What?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Didn't sometimes He eat a lot of food?,Prabhupāda,Who?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:LordCaitanya.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. And His mother would prepare nice dishes and offer toViṣṇuand think, ""Oh, this niceprasādam,I could offer my sonCaitanyaMahāprabhu...,Nimāi, but He is..."" She would cry. She was crying, ""Oh, the boy is no longer here."" Then, after some time, she would see the whole finished, wholeprasādam.""What happened? I did not offer toViṣṇuDeity? I simply brought the empty pot? Maybe."" Then again she goes to the kitchen, and... ""There is also nothing."" Then again cook. ""Perhaps I have forgotten to cook even, thinking ofCaitanya."" Then again she'll offer. AndCaitanyaMahāprabhusent news by some men that ""Inform mother that one day she was thinking like that. So I went there. I ate everything, and she saw everything empty. She'll remember. Then again she cooked. And mother will feel happy. ""Oh, thenNimāicame and did it. Oh, it is very nice."" So this scene is very pathetic."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. But how will we make... We will show Him take the food while her... How will we show this? How will we produce this? That she is sitting there, offering the food...",Prabhupāda,"No. You don't offer. Simply offering, and you'll simply play, ""Where is the food?"" That way."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Oh.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Not real food.,Prabhupāda,"No. Or... Real food is not required. Simply that explain it. Or you can do one thing. You can offer real food. And since she will be in devotion, one may take the foodstuff and distribute to the audience and keep it. That will be also nice."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Yes. Maybe we can distributeprasādatwice in the play.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Even just to... Maybe that plate we'll just give to a few people nearby.,Prabhupāda,Yes. [break]
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:...first speak in detail about Ṭhākura Haridāsa's disappearance. So tell me maybe how you want it to be performed.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. ṬhākuraHaridāsawas living in a cottage which was... Just like I am living here, and the garagesitea little far off,Haridāsawas living a little distance. So when LordCaitanyaMahāprabhuused to go to the sea for taking bath, He every day, every morning He used to go toHaridāsaṬhākura and taking his informa..., ""Haridāsa, what you are doing?"" BecauseHaridāsawas Mohammedan by birth, so out of his meekness he did not go to the temple. But in those... Especially in those days they were very strict. They do not allow anyone except Hindus to enter the temple. Nowadays, of course, there is law. If somebody is, actually has come to theHinduway of life, he's allowed. Our Jayagovinda and others were allowed to seeJagannāthatemple. But in those days there were no such system andHaridāsaout of his own accord, he did not want to disturb But LordCaitanya, God Himself, used to come to see him every day. So one day whenCaitanyacame, he looked little bit depressed. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhuasked him, ""Haridāsa, you do not look very well today. What is the matter?"" ""Sir, I'm not very feeling well. And because I do not feel well, I could not finished my chanting."" He was chanting daily 300,000 times. ""So I could not finish my chanting."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""All right. You are growing old. You may not follow the rules now strictly. You can make it later.""HaridāsaṬhākura said, ""No, Sir, so long my life is there I shall try to follow. When the life is over, that is different thing. But I have got one desire if You fulfill."" ""What is that?"" ""Now I can understand that You will also leave this world very soon. So I cannot tolerate that. So best thing is that before You'll go, I go. And my another request is that You shall stand before me, and I shall leave this body."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""Oh, if that is your desire, that will be all right. That is not difficult."" So next day, whenCaitanyaMahāprabhucame,HaridāsaṬhākura said, ""Sir, today I wish to leave. So You please stand before me."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhualso could understand that he's leaving. So He asked His devotees to chantHareKṛṣṇa, and in the presence ofCaitanyaMahāprabhuhe left. ThenCaitanyaMahāprabhutook this body, and Himself He went... He carried the body. He was very stout and strong. And He was dancing and... Then He went to the seaside, and He bathed the body, and in His own hands He buriedCaitanya, uh,HaridāsaṬhākura's body within the sand. So that burial place is still there inPurī,HaridāsaṬhākura'ssamādhi.Then He personally went to the shopkeepers and beggedprasādam.""You give Me someprasādam.""All people gave Him so many things.CaitanyaMahāprabhuwas so well-known. So He asked all the devotees to takeprasādamafter the burial ceremony was over. In this wayHaridāsaṬhākura's...Niryāna.This is called departure ofHaridāsaṬhākura. That is stated inCaitanya-caritāmṛta."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:I noticed that someone in the temple was reading a book,The Divine Name.",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:And it talks about this. Should I look at that book or not at all?,Prabhupāda,Which book?
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:It's calledThe Divine Name.It is by one of your Godbrothers.,Prabhupāda,Oh yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Is it all right to read it?,Prabhupāda,"Oh yes. There are some discrepancies, but it is, on the whole, it is nice. Yes. There is...HaridāsaṬhākura'sniryānais stated there? Yes.RāghavaCaitanya. Yes, he was my Godbrother. You have secured that book?"
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Upendradāsahas it.,Prabhupāda,Oh. That's good. That's nice.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:There's a scene about LordCaitanyaembracing the leperVasudeva.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Is that a nice scene to perform?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. While He was traveling in South India, in a village that leperVasudeva, he was coming to seeCaitanyafrom a very distant place. And then when he came to see Him,CaitanyaMahāprabhuhad already left. So he was so sorry and crying. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhucame back and embraced him and he was cured. These are some of the miracles."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:In the introduction to theTeachings of LordCaitanya,up until the age of 31 there is description, but then there is very little description from the age of 31 to Lord Caitanya's disappearance. Maybe you can tell me as much as you can of what happened...",Prabhupāda,"He left His home at the age of 24 years. Then He made His headquarter inJagannāthaPurī. For six years He traveled all over India. That means up to thirty years. And after that He remained inJagannāthaPurīfor 18 years. He was chanting in the evening in theJagannāthatemple, and taking bath. And during this car festival all devotees, especially from Bengal, would go there and live there for four months. And after seeing the Rathayātrā ceremony, they will remain there for four months. Then they will come back. This was going on year after year."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:Are there any nice stories you can tell me so that I can... See, I need some stories from that part of His life to show in the play how He... Some incidents, memorable, you know, that...",Prabhupāda,"There were not many. The Rathayātrā is very nice. He was chanting with a group of devotees, and while the car festival is going on. And sometimes car used to stop. It still stops. That is the fashion ofJagannātha. And nobody could, even an elephant could not draw it. ThenCaitanyaMahāprabhuwill say, ""All right, come on."" So He would push it with His head and it will go on."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:What did the people say when they saw that?,Prabhupāda,"Then... That was...CaitanyaMahāprabhualready adored, He was. So, there is... Rathayātrā car festival, andGuṇḍicā-mārjana.Guṇḍicā-mārjana.Before theRathayātrāfestival, the system isJagannāthagoes from the temple to another place about two miles away. There is a big temple there also which is calledJagannāthaAunt's(?) house,Mahiṣībadi.So He stays there for eight days. Just like we make program inSanFrancisco to reside on seaside. So that temple was to be washed.CaitanyaMahāprabhuused to do it by His personal supervision. So all the devotees... And He will check how much dust you have recovered, and then you shall be rewarded. Otherwise, it should be understood that you have not labored nicely. (chuckles) So He'll sweep over the whole temple nicely and wash the ceilings and walls and everything so clearly. And He'll see in this way if there is any sand. If there is, ""Oh, it is not washed."" That means He would engage everyone. Then after washing, then call forprasādamand distribute Himself. This is calledGuṇḍicā-mārjana.Actually, whatever He was doing, they were washing, ""HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa,"" chanting. That's all."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:He used to eat a lot of food?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Not always. But people used to present some foodstuffs. Especially when the devotees would come from Bengal side, somebody is bringing something, somebody is... WhateverCaitanyaMahāprabhulikes. And they will prepare the whole year nice foodstuffs. That is, what is called, preserved food. You can keep it for days together. So His personal assistant wasGovinda, and everyone will, I mean to say, offerGovinda, ""Please offer this food toPrabhu."" AndGovindawill keep. And everyone is anxious whether his goods are taken. So he was inquiringGovinda, ""HasMahāprabhuhas taken my food?"" What can he say? ""Yes, yes, yes, yes."" But it is stacked in the store. So one dayCaitanyaMahāprabhuHe said that... He was Godbrother also,CaitanyaMahāprabhu. He could talk with Him freely. He was not disciple. So ""GuruMahārājasent me to serve You, and now the result is that for You I have to speak only lies."" ""What is that? You are speaking lies for Me?"" ""Yes. Why not? What can I do?"" ""Now, what is the matter?"" ""Now, Your devotees give me so many things for eating and just lying stacked. And they inquire and I say 'Yes, yes. He has taken.' So this is my business, telling lie."" So thenCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""All right. Bring something. I shall eat."" So he brought one bag and He ate everything. ""Bring next."" In this way the whole stack, about 100 men's foodstuff, He ate. Then He asked him, ""Bring more."" ""Now the bags are lying only. If You want to eat, (chuckling) You can eat."" ""All right. Stop."" So in half an hour, one hour, He ate all the 100 men's stock. You see. This is also another miracle. He finished the whole stock to save him from speaking lies."
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:These are the kind of things that will be very nice to present. Those are the things that I would like to do, because people will...",Prabhupāda,"Another incident duringPurī...RāmānandaRāya, he was a great devotee. So his younger brother, he was engaged in government service,MahārājaPratāparudra's service. But he was akarmiand a rich man. So he misappropriated some money for sense gratification from the treasury. So this was... And he had some, what is called, competition, or rivalry, between the king's son and himself. The king's son did not like him, so he was trying to put him in some difficulty. This man... His name is... He'sRāmānandaRāya's brother. His name is there. I can find out. So he found out some fault with him and informed his father that ""Your such and such person has doing like this. He has misappropriated the money. I paid him so much money for purchasing horse, and he has purchased horse less price. He was charged so much."" ""Oh,"" the king said, ""Oh, how is that? He cannot do that. Realize that money."" So he got some clue. So he said that ""You must pay. This is not the right price. The state cannot accept at high price this kind of horses."" So he said, ""All right. I shall sell somewhere and repay the price."" Then there was some argument. He said, ""Why you have charged so much for this horse? This is not a very good horse."" He said, ""Yes, it is good horse. My horse does not look like this."" That man, that king's son was looking like this. So he criticized him, so he became more angry. Because you know, everyone, that a horse who looks down like this, that is bad(?) horse. Or looking like this, he's not first-class horse. Do you know that? (laughter) Horse, like this,kat,kat,kat,kat, that is first-class horse. And if horse goes like this, that is not good horse. So he criticized him, and he became angry, and he complained to his father that he's not paying. Rather, he's criticizing me. And he said, ""All right. Press him. He'll pay."" So the... In those days the highest punishment wascangeutthanā.Cangeutthanāmeans a platform is made very high and swords are put in the, this way. And one man is thrown on the swords. That is calledcangeutthanā.So the arrangement was to punish him like that. So when the arrangement was made, everyone became frightened that ""This man will be killed."" So they presented the fact toCaitanyaMahāprabhuthat ""He is Your devotee. He has served so much. Now he is in danger. If You kindly send some note to the king, he is also great admirer, then he may save his life.""CaitanyaMahāprabhurefused, ""Oh, he has misappropriated state's money, and you want Me to approach a pound-shilling man, king."" He was not seeing even the king. ""Oh, this is not possible for him. Let him be punished. He has taken money from the state. I don't wish to interfere."" Then nobody could request him anything. So some way or other, the news approached the king, and the king was astonished, ""Oh, why this arrangement was made for killing him? I never ordered. Stop him."" Then he sent his special messenger, that, ""Stop this and call him. What is the matter?"" Then he said everything, that, ""Your son, I could not pay his money. He wanted money, and he made this arrangement."" So, ""Why did you take money in this way? Do you think your salary is not sufficient to provide you? All right. Don't do this. All right, I excuse. And I increase your salary double. Don't do this again."" So was he saved in his life, his salary was increased. And he was going to be killed. AlthoughCaitanyaMahāprabhunever desired, but these things happened. So?"
Tamāla,"TamālaKṛṣṇa:If you can just tell me what you, the best way to have a nice scene ofJagāiandMādhāi.",Prabhupāda,"The first scene should be thatNityānandaPrabhuandHaridāsaṬhākura. They were ordered byCaitanyaMahāprabhuto go every day to, from one neighborhood to another and preach. So one day when they came out they saw at a distant place a crowd. So you have to make scene that a crowded place and these two brothers,JagāiandMādhāi, they have pickpocketed somebody and... Because they were debauches, so there was some howling and crowds. Yes. SoNityānandaPrabhuinquired, and people said that ""These two brothers, they're born of a very respectable family, but they have now become debauches."" SoNityānandaPrabhu, ""Oh, they are so fallen? So best thing is to convert them first. Then Lord Caitanya's name will be glorious that He has delivered such rascals."" So He went there to save. Then he said, ""Who are you?"" As soon as they came in,HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇa, chanting, and these brothers said, ""Oh, who are you?"" ""Oh, we areNityānanda, and he isHaridāsa. We are preaching. You also join with us."" So, ""Oh get out!HareKṛṣṇa, your damnHareKṛṣṇa. Get out!"" (chuckles) SoHaridāsaṬhākura was old man, and he was afraid. ButNityānandawas young man so He fled away.HaridāsaṬhākura could not go so swift. He said, ""My dearNityānanda, I think today my life is at risk."" So anyway, then after they were going away, the crowd dispersed and the brothers were talking. So one brother was talking to the other, ""Jagāi, I think that these people very nicely sing. Don't you hear?"" ""Oh! You are going to be asaṅkīrtanaman?"" ""No, no, no! I am not going to besaṅkīrtanaman. Just I am talking about it."" So this was their beginning appreciation. Then next day, again in the same place,Nityānandacame, and He requested, ""My dear brothers, you chantHareKṛṣṇa."" So theMādhāi, noJagāi,Jagāiwas so angry. They were drinking. So here you drink in bottles. They drink in earthen pot. So there was earthen pot. He hurled against His head and there was blood oozing out. So the other brother,Mādhāisaid, ""Oh, what you are doing? What you are doing? He's innocent."" This news was reached toCaitanyaMahāprabhu.CaitanyaMahāprabhuwas very much angry. He came, ""Bring Mycakra.I shall kill these rascals immediately."" He became so angry. ThenNityānandaPrabhuimplored, ""My dear brother, why You are very angry? They are the sample of this age. So if You become angry, then whom we are going to deliver? The whole population is full of likeJagāiandMādhāi. So our preaching is for the most fallen. Why do You remember, why do You forget this? Don't be angry."" Then both the brothers, they fell on the feet ofNityānanda. ""Please forgive us. We have done wrong. You are so nice people. You are chantingHareKṛṣṇaso innocent, and we are so..."" This is the effect of seeing a pure devotee. Heart becomes soft. This is the association, effect of association. So they surrendered. SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""Yes, I will accept you. I don't care for your past deeds, but you have to agree that no more this nonsense."" That means before initiation one might have done all nonsense things. That doesn't matter. That is not disqualification. But after initiation one should not. Then his life is changed immediately by thisHareKṛṣṇamovement. This is the instruction ofJagāi-Mādhāi. So there were only twoJagāi-Mādhāis, but you'll meet hundreds ofJagāi-Mādhāis. So... But they can be delivered. There is no question that in their past life they had been sinful. Simply they have to agree that ""No more this nonsense."" Therefore I have kept these restrictions, these four restrictions. Anyone who adopts this life and initiated, and follows these restrictions, then he begins a new life."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:How can we show... We can't throw a pot at someone's head every night we perform this. It's not feasible to throw something at someone's head each time we do this.,Prabhupāda,"You do? No? No, no. You just make a...like this. That's all. AndNityānandamay be smearing his head and found some blood. In this way you can do like that. After all, it is show."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:What we can do is make the two brothers maybe attack one of the visitors who are watching it.,Prabhupāda,"Just like in play they keep some sponge with red color and somebody stabs, ""Oohh!"" and he squeezes. (laughter) In that way you can do it like that. After all, it is play. That's all. This is very important scene,Jagāi-Mādhāiuddhara.Yes. You have to set very nicely."
Tamāla,TamālaKṛṣṇa:Okay. We'll go now.,Prabhupāda,No. You just haveārati?Ārati?
Govinda,Govindadāsī:Yes.,Prabhupāda,"And thatKṛṣṇa-kīrtana.This... Let them hear. (end) September ...Prabhu, you understand English?"
Woman:,Woman:Yes.,Prabhupāda,You stay with your son?
Woman:,Woman:No. I am ...(unclear).,Prabhupāda,"So why don't you stay here and join your son for preachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness? Because your son is so good, you must be good. Because a son cannot be good unless the mother is good. Because son inherits the mother's quality. That is nature. This Hayagrīva's mother wrote me first one letter of congratulations, and she came also to see me in New Vrindaban, his father and mother. Especially his mother is very happy. ThisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement will produce good father and mother, and therefore they will have good children, and there will be no problem in the world. If everyone isKṛṣṇaconscious. Not everyone, even ten per cent people becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, there will be no problem. Problem is created due to bad children. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Varṇa-saṅkara.So if there are good children, there is no problem. Even in this material world, everything will become happy. The basic principle of Vedic civilization is to create good children. All the rules and regulations, everything is there just to create good children. In the first chapter ofBhagavad-gītāthese things are described very nicely byArjuna. There are many purificatory processes to create a good child. A human being is not meant for creating offspring like cats and dogs. They must produce very good child. That is Vedic civilization. Good child meansKṛṣṇaconscious child. That's all. Yes. So we are trying to turn these children of the Western world, good children. And people should cooperate with us, this movement. We are taking care of the children, especially young boys and girls who are coming, and we are taking care of them very nicely. Sometimes we are getting them married also, to make their life very peaceful and intelligent and spiritually advanced and make a solution of life. So people should come forward to cooperate with this movement. How many children you have got? Two?"
Woman:,Woman:Two boys. And other one.,Prabhupāda,Other. He is eldest?
Woman:,Woman:Yes.,Prabhupāda,Where is that boy?
Woman:,Woman:The other one is in Canada.,Prabhupāda,Canada? In Vancouver? No.
Devotee:,Devotee:No. In Calgary.,Prabhupāda,[break] ...making solution.Hayagrīva? You are biased.
Hayagrīva,Yes. (laughter),Prabhupāda,"You suggest that ""Here is another solution. Why we should take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness?"" No. There is no other. You have got any suggestion, any other method? No. Then why don't you take to it and preach? What is the difficulty? You don't like? [break] ...especiallyKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Yes. That is the instruction ofRūpaGosvāmī.Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā-matiḥkrīyatāṁyadikuto 'pilabhyatetatralaulyamekalaṁmūlyamnajanma-koṭisukṛtairlabhyate.Very nice verse. He instructs that ""If you can purchaseKṛṣṇaconsciousness from any market, any store, please immediately buy it."" Then next question is ""Then what is the price? What shall I have to pay for it?"" AndRūpaGosvāmī says, ""Oh, the price is simply eagerness.""Tatralaulyam... ""Yes, I must haveKṛṣṇaconsciousness."" That is the price.Laulyam,that eagerness is not achieved even after many, many births. That is the price. Therefore it requires a little intelligence. ""Oh, such a valuable thing? I can purchase only by eagerness? Why not become eager immediately?"" That is intelligence. You are German or Australian or... (end)  Would you like to record or not?"
George Harrison:,George Harrison:Don't mind.,Prabhupāda,Give this garland.
George Harrison:,George Harrison:Thank you.HareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda,This Kṛṣṇa's blessings.
