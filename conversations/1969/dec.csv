Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:The classes are at 7. We have some fliers to hand out to you. [break] Swami's there Monday, Wednesday, [break] ...next Monday. So this is a real class with real progress. We're studyingBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.[break] I'm going to go around with a tambourine upside down for a collection. That will help us to keep this program going nicely in this area. Also, very important, the Swami will leave this area as soon as another city gives him something more attractive. Attractive means to preachKṛṣṇaconsciousness. [break]",Prabhupāda,"That you have to test. Now I have given you this one formula. By following anyguruor any principle, if you actually develop your love of God, then it is nice. Otherwise it is useless waste of time. That is the test. But they, so far I know, these yogis, they are themselves God. They say that everyone is God. And who is dog? So I think it is not very congenial. How everyone can be God? Then what is the meaning of God?"
Guest (1):,Guest (1):(inaudible),Prabhupāda,"If everyone is God then what is the meaning of God? You must give definition of God. If you do not, then you do not know what is God. Therefore you are asking..."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):(inaudible),Prabhupāda,"So it is a great science. It is not bogus propaganda. And based onBhagavad-gītāand Vedic literatures. Not that it is imaginary. No. There is...(inaudible), realized persons. There is chance of...(inaudible). So if you are here now, take advantage of this great science. And we are prepared to submit... (many people talking)"
Guest (2) (Indian man):,Guest (2) (Indian man):I want to love everyone.,Prabhupāda,"Then you... That is bogus. You cannot love everybody. If you love God, then you can love everybody. Because God is everything. So just like if you pour water on the root..."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):If God is everything, then why don't you, not loving one by one? Why...?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. But you... That is... Just like if you love one tree, then you have to pour water on the root. Not that every leaf. If you want to maintain your body, then you have to supply foodstuff in the stomach. Not to your eyes. Not to your ear. When you get a nice cake, you don't put it here. You put it here. Why? That is the process. There are nine holes in your body. Why do you put in this hole?"
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Yes, but...",Prabhupāda,First of all answer this.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Well, I agree with you, but...",Prabhupāda,You have to follow the real process; then you'll get it. That is love.(?)
Guest (2):,Guest (2):You have to go to the root but in the meantime we don't ignore everything else. I mean...,Prabhupāda,If you ignore the root and you take the leaf you simply spoil your time.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No, but what I wanted to say is that why can't love of the God and love of matter go and rise up to...?",Prabhupāda,"Yes, if you love God, you love matter and God..."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):Then you said that the technique, that you decide as to whether you are succeeding is, you'll find out whether a technique is the best or not when your love for God will increase and love for matter will decrease.",Prabhupāda,"No. In relationship with God... What is matter? Matter is another manifestation of God's energy. Just like if you love yourself, your body, then naturally you love your finger, the part of the body. Therefore God is the supreme whole. If you love God, then you can understand that I have to love everybody."
Guest (3) (Indian man):,Guest (3) (Indian man):What is God?,Prabhupāda,What is God? God... Can you define God?
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Is God supposed to be energy or is God supposed to be...,Prabhupāda,"Energy is God's energy. Just like sun and sunshine. Sunshine is the energy of sun. Just try to understand. The energy, sunshine, and the sun is not different. But still if you are satisfied with the energy sunshine, it is not sun. Try to understand this philosophy."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Are you saying that energy is God? God is energy?,Prabhupāda,"Energy, being nondifferent from God, in one sense, it is God, but energy is not God at the same time. The same example. Just like sun and the sunshine. Sunshine is the energy of the sun, but sunshine, if it enters in your room, if you think that ""Sun has entered into my room,"" that is wrong. But sunshine is not different from the sun. Similarly... That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā,mayātatamidaṁsarvaṁjagatavyakta-mūrtinā,mat-sthāni...[Bg.9.4]. [break] ""Everything is resting in Me."" That means in His energy. But not that everything is God."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):It would appear that to claim that you can reach eternal bliss or I don't know what else you might call it, by just chanting, it seems to be too easy.",Prabhupāda,"That is one process of self-realization. There are different process of self-realization. For this age, when people are less intelligent, this process is right."
Guest (2):,Guest (2):...what you are doing by chanting is kind of...,Prabhupāda,"You chant and you will understand. If you have no child, then how can you understand what is the labor of producing a child?"
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):But then it is like saying that if you haven't ever leaped into a well, you don't know what will happen to you if you leap into a well.",Prabhupāda,"First of all you do not know yourself. The first ignorance is that you are identifying yourself with this body, which you are not. First of all try to understand yourself, then you will understand what is God. You do not know yourself."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):But I am God, right? I am God. You are God too.",Prabhupāda,You are dog.
Guest (3):,Guest (3):But you are me and I am you. We are both God. Right?,Prabhupāda,"No, no."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Why not?,Prabhupāda,You are not God because God... You do not know what is the meaning of God. What do you mean by God? First of all define.
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Everything is God.,Prabhupāda,"If you apply that definition, then you are God. First of all define what is God."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):God is everything. God is it.,Prabhupāda,That is not the definition. God is not everything.
Guest (3):,Guest (3):And it is God. It is all it.,Prabhupāda,I say everything is God's energy. Everything is not God.
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Everything is not God?,Prabhupāda,Yes. Just like the same example I gave immediately that the sunshine and the sun. Sunshine is not different from the sun.
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):How can the sun itself be different from it's energy? Sunshine is energy, sun is energy, and both of them...",Prabhupāda,"No. This is an example. Sunshine is also energy. Everything material is an energy of the Lord. That's all right. But I'm giving you the example that sunshine and the sun is one, but at the same time different, simultaneously. You cannot accept sunshine as the sun. Suppose you are in the sunshine, you cannot say that you are in the sun planet."
Guest (3):,Guest (3):But it's all the same.,Prabhupāda,No. Why all the same? Why all the same?
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Of course. It's all the same. Sure.,Prabhupāda,"If you go to the sun, you... You cannot go. You have no imagination what is sun, although you see it. How can I say that sunshine and sun is all the same?"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):No. You don't have to have imagination. You have to have insight. That's... That's...,Prabhupāda,"What is that insight? Do you think that sunshine and sun, they can be, is one?"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Everything is the same.,Prabhupāda,"No, you cannot say that, that the temperature of the sun and the temperature of the sunshine is the same."
Guest (2):,"Guest (2):No. But just because you have two different kinds of energies, why do you have to differentiate them? Essentially what he was trying to say...",Prabhupāda,"That is intelligence. That is intelligence. One energy is acting as cooling, and the same energy is acting as heating. Why do you say it is heat and it is cool?"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):It's all the same thing. Heat and cool is the same thing.,Prabhupāda,Why do you say the same thing? It is not the same thing.
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):Everything is ""it."" It's all it.",Prabhupāda,"No. That is nonsense. Cold is cold, heat is heat. Only it is acting. You are talking on the material platform. You are not spiritual. You don't talk nonsense. (laughter) No. We have got enough time."
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):I'm not trying to argue with you. I'm just trying to understand, because from what I understand of it there is no difference between...",Prabhupāda,Just try to understand...
Guest (3):,Guest (3):No wait. Wait. Just one moment. Cause and effect are all the same thing.,Prabhupāda,"No, no, no, no."
Devotee:,Devotee:What do you mean they're the same thing?,Prabhupāda,This is cotton. The cause is cotton. Will you like to take cotton instead of the shirt?
Guest (3):,Guest (3):This is illusion.,Prabhupāda,Not illusion.
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Sure.,Prabhupāda,"What do you mean by illusion? Don't talk nonsense. (laughter) If I gave you lump of cotton instead of this shirt, will you accept it?"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):I'm sorry. I don't mean to argue. I am sorry.,Prabhupāda,You are arguing?
Guest (3):,Guest (3):I don't mean to argue with you.,Prabhupāda,No. If I say...
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):I'm trying to understand something, but you...",Prabhupāda,This is cotton. This is cotton. Everyone knows. But if I give you a lump...
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Do you know that? Do you know that for a fact? How do you know this is not illusion? How do you know that? Do we know anything for sure?,Prabhupāda,What proof is that is illusion?
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):No, no. Wait. The burden of the proof lies on you because I don't claim it is cotton. You claim it is cotton. So...",Prabhupāda,How do you say it is not cotton. First of all prove it.
Guest (3):,Guest (3):Initially...,Prabhupāda,No! First of all prove it that it is not cotton.
Guest (3):,"Guest (3):No, no. One moment. You claim that it is cotton, therefore the burden of the proof lies on you inasmuch as you have to prove...",Prabhupāda,"Everyone will say it is cotton. Everyone will say it is cotton. That is proof. Everyone will accept this is cotton, made of cotton. Who will say this is not made of cotton? But if I give you a lump of cotton instead of shirt will you accept it?"
Guest (3):,Guest (3):I apologize. I don't mean to argue with you. I'm just trying to...,Prabhupāda,"No, why not?"
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):You speak of God and matter and as matter being the thing which keeps us from seeing God. It seems to me it's something like pride and delusions, myself, and something like this, and ideas that I have.",Prabhupāda,"You may have ideas, but I don't agree with your idea. If... I say that anything take it material or spiritual they are different energy of God. Matter is not different from God as it is energy of God, but still matter is not God."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):Yes.,Prabhupāda,"Just try to understand this point, that whatever we see, that is distribution of energy of God. But energy and the energetic is not the same. But they are same as...simultaneously same also because you cannot separate. Just like fire and heat. You cannot separate heat from fire but heat is not fire. Just try to understand this. Heat is not fire although heat and fire cannot be separated."
Guest (1):,Guest (1):But I don't think I'm thinking of myself as matter but I'm also not thinking of myself as...,Prabhupāda,"No. You are not matter. You are spirit. Your body is matter. You are also one of the energies. You are spiritual energy and your body is material energy. And because you are spiritual energy, therefore your intimate relationship with the spirit soul or the Supreme Soul... That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness or God consciousness. The body will change, but you, as spirit soul, you will not change. You are eternal.Nahanyatehanyamāneśarīre[Bg.2.20]. Body being changed, that is not changed. That is eternal. So we have to pick up our eternal relationship with God. That is missing."
Guest (1):,"Guest (1):I'd like to know how physical things that are done, as chanting or dancing or... Are there no...? If you consider , as having any importance. How do these physical things affect our spiritual understanding?",Prabhupāda,"Physical... Just like a milk preparation. You take large quantity of milk, you get diarrhea. But the same milk, if it is prepared into yogurt, if you take it, your diarrhea will be cured. So physical things, when treated spiritually, it cures physical disease."
Guest (4) (Indian man):,"Guest (4) (Indian man):You said the approach to spiritual goal, through this way,HareKṛṣṇaHareRāma. Okay. Now there is another philosophy which has been preached by Ramakrishna and Vivekananda: ""The service of man is the service of God.""",Prabhupāda,And why not service of God service of man?
Guest (4):,Guest (4):No...,Prabhupāda,"First of all answer this. If service of man is service of God, why not service of God, service of man?"
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Okay. It is one and the same thing because within man is within the soul, which is...",Prabhupāda,"So, one thing, suppose that service of God is service of man, then why should you go door to door serving ... If God is service of man, if you say service of man is service of God, then service of God is service of man."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Okay. Fine.,Prabhupāda,That's all. Now if by serving God I can serve whole humanity...
Guest (4):,Guest (4):That's good.,Prabhupāda,"That's good. But you, how many human beings you can serve? So my process is better."
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):But I don't know what is God, but I know man within which God is present, a part of God is present.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. That's all right. That means we are, I mean to say for argument's sake. If God is everything..."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):We are the parts of God.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. Now parts of God, just like your finger is part of your body. Suppose if you wash your finger, does it mean you are taking bath whole body?"
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):No, no, no, no. No.",Prabhupāda,Then how we can serve the whole by serving the part?
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Well, because it is a problem today, and right now, we country...",Prabhupāda,"Your argument is that service of man is service of God. That is your point. I say that if service of man is service of God, then service of God is service of man. First of all you yes or no, you say it."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):It is one and the same but because I don't know God...,Prabhupāda,Then we serve God. You serve men. That's all.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):I don't know God. That's why... Which is present and which is a philosophy. That's why...,Prabhupāda,"Now, philosophy,... Your argument is service of man is service of God."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):It is not my argument. It is argument of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda.,Prabhupāda,Now you are representing Ramakrishna. You are representing Ramakrishna. That's all. I take it.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Because I am also in doubt about... I want to know the truth.,Prabhupāda,"The truth is... The example I have given you, that service of the body means service of the stomach. Service of the body does not mean service of the finger."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Service of the body means the service of part of God because body is an embodiment of the...,Prabhupāda,"Now, I'll give you the example. Suppose if you want to... Take the whole body. If you want to serve this body you must give food. So where to give the food? To the finger or to the stomach? Therefore God is the stomach. Supply food there and every part of the body will be full."
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Okay good. Stomach is the part of God. I don't say he's the whole of God. Part of God. Because... (several people are talking),Prabhupāda,All right. Car is waiting.
Guest (4):,Guest (4):Okay. Next time I go to Harvard I'll just get...,Prabhupāda,Thank you. I thank you for your questions.
Guest (4):,"Guest (4):Oh, okay, fine. I'll ask you again. (end)",Prabhupāda,...form a committee from education in your...
Hayagrīva,"They have to be taught reading, and for this they have primers.",Prabhupāda,Primary readings.
Hayagrīva,And this is all right to use?,Prabhupāda,Because we haven't got any books yet.
Hayagrīva,What about taking the primers and changing the names of the people to people likeSatyabhāmāand give them spiritual names. Would that be nice?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Pradyumna,Hari-nāmāmṛtam.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,All right. Arithmetic should be taught?,Prabhupāda,Arithmetic? Yes. That is necessary.
Hayagrīva,What about any history? World history or American history or American literature or English literature?,Prabhupāda,American history. That's all. They are Americans. They should learn American history. Don't bother much.
Hayagrīva,Any Indian history?,Prabhupāda,"Indian history, that...Bhāgavatais all right."
Hayagrīva,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?,Prabhupāda,ThatKurukṣetrabattle. That's all. And there are many other stories in theBhāgavatam.They are all historical.
Hayagrīva,"What about literatures? When they get older, of course. This would be for when they are older.",Prabhupāda,"Literature, we have got so many.Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavata."
Hayagrīva,"Any English literature, American literature, English literature?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Any... Some of the English literature, recognized."
Hayagrīva,Any of the sciences at all?,Prabhupāda,I don't think we require any science. What do you think?
Hayagrīva,"Geology, zoology, astronomy.",Prabhupāda,"Biology, you can teach them the evolution of the species fromPadma-Purāṇa,8,400,000's, one after another. Yes."
Hayagrīva,What about astronomy? Anything like that? No. Okay. Any animal husbandry they can learn out there. Animal husbandry they will learn...,Prabhupāda,"That they will learn practically, cow keeping."
Hayagrīva,At what age should they be taught to cookprasādam?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,At what age should they be taught to cook?,Prabhupāda,After twelve years.
Hayagrīva,"After twelve. And you think they can be taught typing, for instance? A skill like typing and how to use typewriter?",Prabhupāda,"Does it require all? Well, just this knowledge is required."
Hayagrīva,"And the only other... Oh, how old should they be before Deity worship, they do Deity worship?",Prabhupāda,Just after ten years.
Hayagrīva,After ten years? Then they can do Deity worship?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,That'sRādhā-KṛṣṇaDeity worship.,Prabhupāda,Any Deity. Or worshipRādhā-Kṛṣṇa.
Hayagrīva,He said after ten.,Prabhupāda,"No, they are keeping as plaything now, not they are regularly worshiping."
Kīrtanānanda:,"Kīrtanānanda:He means in the temple they can officiate, doāratiand things...",Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,"And you suggested... I have it written down somewhere. You suggested a certain number of hours for their school, about five hours or four hours a day.",Prabhupāda,"Three hours in the morning, two hours in the evening. That's all. Not at a stretch. Morning, evening. And in the noon they should take theirprasādam,take little rest."
Hayagrīva,Because our literatures are a little difficult to read...,Prabhupāda,Yes. You have to make some suitable literature.
Hayagrīva,"Something... When they can do that, then they can readBhagavad-gītā.They try a little, but it's very difficult to begin.",Prabhupāda,No.
Hayagrīva,They cannot begin.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. (end) ThisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is composed of four different stages. The first stage is to understand the relationship with Godhead, orKṛṣṇa. Because the conditioned souls at the present moment, they have forgotten self. They have forgotten their relationship withKṛṣṇa. Actually the relationship is there, eternal, but under the influence ofmāyāhe is thinking that ""I am something of this material world,"" identifying himself with this body. So we have to awake them from that illusory existence, what he is not. The whole mistake of the modern status of life... I don't say modern civilization. This is coming up since the creation of this material world. Sometimes it is in greater degree and sometimes in lesser degree. InSatya-yugathe same condition, but in lesser degree. But inKali-yugathe condition is in greater degree. So the first business is to awake the conditioned souls from their illusory position, that he is thinking, ""I am this body and anything in relationship with this body is very important.""Janasyamoho 'yamahaṁmameti[SB5.5.8].This is illusion. We speak of illusion,māyā.This is illusion, that ""I am this body and anything in relation of this body..."" I have got special relationship with certain woman, so I think, ""She is my wife. I cannot do without her."" Or another woman from whom I have taken birth, ""She is my mother."" Similarly father, similarly sons. In this way, country, society, at the most, humanity. That's all. But all these things are illusion because they are in bodily relationship.Yasyātmā-buddhiḥkunapetri-dhātukesaevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13].Those who are passing on on this illusory condition of life, they are compared with the cows and the asses. So our first business is to wake up the general mass of people from this illusory condition of life. SoBack to Godheadis specially meant for that purpose. We are pushing ourBack to Godheadto the general mass of people to the first condition, first status of enlightenment. And then those who are becoming enlightened, coming forward, ""Swamiji, or the society, please make me a member. Please initiate me,"" he is coming forward, understanding his position. So that is second stage, to train him how to awaken his, that dormant love of God. That is another stage, training.Sambandhaabhidheya.Then, when he is actually in love of Godhead, then he can understand the higher status of loving exchange betweenRādhāandKṛṣṇaand theVṛndāvana. This is third, third stage, yes. And the fourth stage isparamahaṁsastage, who is always enjoying.Santaḥsadaivahṛdayeṣuvilokayanti. Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti...When one is completely merged in the ocean of love of Godhead, he will relish in any condition of lifeKṛṣṇa, present.Kṛṣṇapresent means,Kṛṣṇapresent, His name present, His form present, Hislīlāpresent, His paraphernalia present. Everything.Kṛṣṇais not alone. We are not impersonalist. As soon as we say, ""Kṛṣṇa,""Kṛṣṇameans with His name, fame, opulence, entourage, pastime, etc. SoBack to Godheadgenerally deals in two stages of understanding, the, to awaken the relationship and to train them. Although our aim is... That is our aim, to come to the highest platform of loving exchange, but generally, we are dealing with the mass of people. Therefore our propaganda should be how to, by reasoning, by philosophy, by science, by argument, how to convince him that he is in illusory stage. These politicians, these scientists, these philosophers, they have no advanced knowledge except the human being. That's all. Their ultimate goal is that if they can do something, humanitarian work, welfare work to the... The Vivekananda, or the Aurobindo, or this, what is called, the Russell, or Romain Roland, and so many, they are coming. And the yogis, they are trying to be self-satisfied by meditation. But nobody is concerned with God, orKṛṣṇa. Nobody is concerned. This is the position of the world. So under the circumstances, our first business is how to awaken people from this illusory condition, that he is thinking, ""I am this body,"" or the most well-being is taking care of this body or bodily relationships. So we have to take out from that illusory condition. So that should be the policy of ourBack to Godhead.And the, so far the editors are concerned, they are supposed to know all these conclusions. Now we have got two editors,Hayagrīvaand Satsvarūpa. I believe both of you know the conclusion which I am trying to push on within this movement. So you should work cooperatively in such a way that you don't deviate from the policy, and conjointly, consulting together, so that I may be relieved from petty minor things. But if there is some difficulty, I am at your service. Now what is the difficulty at the present moment? [break]"
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:I have a different list.,Prabhupāda,"And so far the articleHayagrīvawritten, it is very nice. It should be published. Yes. I have seen it."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:That means that we can make reference to thegopīs.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, it is done.Gopīsare boycotted."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:No,gopīsare not boycotted.",Prabhupāda,"The policy should be that the people may not understandgopīslike ordinary girls or like that. You should be careful to present thegopīs.It does not mean that ""We shall not utter even the name ofgopīs.We have taken vow to boycott thegopīs.""No. They are our worshipable devotees. How we can avoid them?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:What about writing down ""kissing the lips of Kṛṣṇa""?",Prabhupāda,"No. That we should avoid. That we should avoid. But that is not abominable. According to time and circumstances... That thing I have described. The fact is fact. Just like when I am describing Kṛṣṇa'slīlā—I writing Kṛṣṇa's life—so I cannot give up that portion of His life, whenKṛṣṇais actually kissing thegopīsinrasadance."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:But that's in the books. Not in the public...,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So in such circumstances, of course, we can give. But as far as possible, very cautiously and very rarely we shall present.CaitanyaMahāprabhu's life we see that in public He never discussed about Kṛṣṇa'slīlāwith thegopīs.That was very confidential discussion amongst His own circle,RāyaRāmaṇanda,SvarūpaDāmodara, like that. And He inquired... Even a learned scholar, He discussed about the philosophy, thatSarvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya. But when there was a great devotee likeRāmānandaRāya, He relishedgopīs',I mean to say, intimate behavior withKṛṣṇa. So we should remember this, that public may misunderstand this. Therefore we have to present these things very cautiously, not very openly. They may misunderstand. But so far this article is concerned, that is nicely written. That is quite in order. So this should be published."
Hayagrīva,There is nothing specificially objectionable?,Prabhupāda,"No, no. There is nothing."
Hayagrīva,"Our process thus far has been to halve up the material about 50-50. He takes half, and I'll take a half, and that seems to be working fairly nicely.",Prabhupāda,"That's all right. But first thing is that when you are in the post of editors, you are supposed to know. But whenever there is some difficulty, either you get it solved by consulting amongst yourselves, or if it is not possible, then refer to me. That's all."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Oh. Then I have one question to ask you. What about quoting evenVaiṣṇavaliterature that you haven't translated, like theCaitanya-caritāmṛtaor cantos that you haven't translated? That doesn't seem right.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Other translations than your own. What if we want to quote them in some article?,Prabhupāda,Other translations means?
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Well, sometimes I seeCaitanya-caritāmṛta.Śilavatī even wrote a book about Deity worship, and there's a long quote fromCaitanya-caritāmṛta.I don't know if that's bona fide. I know that the literature is bona fide, but I don't know of any translation that's bona...",Prabhupāda,Caitanya-caritāmṛta?He has written a book? I have not seen it.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:No. I just mean that devotees, sometimes they write an article and they say, ""As it says in theCaitanya-caritāmṛta,""and they quote a book that they read by some scholar, very goodVaiṣṇavaliterature, but translated by somebody that may not be good.",Prabhupāda,"No. Somebody... So farCaitanya-caritāmṛta,thatNavina-candraRāya... You, mean to say that..."
Brahmānanda,That six volume set? That is all right?,Prabhupāda,That is all right. That is translation. That is all right.
Brahmānanda,"That is the one which is in use, I believe. It's not anything, you know...",Prabhupāda,"That is simply translation. ButCaitanya-caritāmṛtais now presented in ourTLC.Actually that is our conclusion. AndNavinaRāya's translation, there are sometimes little defects, but not very dangerous, not very dangerous."
Hayagrīva,"Should your... In the content, should we put in... How many articles can we put in by you? These are the most important contributions we have, and, say, would it be too much material to put in, say, an essay by you and maybe a lecture or...",Prabhupāda,"Or whatever it may be. That any article may not be more than two, three pages, printed. That will be nice. And if the number of articles are more, how many pages we are going to print?"
Brahmānanda,"Well, there's some discuss... If we print it on our own press we can print it, we could add eight more pages, which would make it forty pages. But we may continue with Dai Nippon inJapan. So I don't know if we'll increase the pages.",Prabhupāda,"So by increasing the pages, what do we immediately get profit? Is there any special advantage we get?"
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:More reading material. More reading material. The customer gets more for his money.,Prabhupāda,"That's all right. We should be businessmen. They should get less for their money. (laughter) We are to pleaseKṛṣṇa, not our customers. So if we are not increasing the price, then why should we increase the pages? Either we print in our own press orJapan, there is extra labor, extra energy. But we are not getting extra money. So there is no need."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:But, Prabhupāda, the point was, can there be more than one article by yourself? Or only one...",Prabhupāda,"No. No. One. One. Everyone one, not more. One man's article, not more than two, either of mine or anyone. But so far our news is concerned..."
Hayagrīva,Not more than two or not more than one?,Prabhupāda,No. Not more than one. Not more than one.
Hayagrīva,You said two or three pages. Maybe four pages would be all...?,Prabhupāda,"Four pages, that's all. But not more than four pages."
Hayagrīva,"There was an excerpt from, I think,KṛṣṇaBook...",Prabhupāda,"No. Whatever is done is done. Now you follow this policy, that one..."
Hayagrīva,What about excerpts from your books? Is that all right?,Prabhupāda,"Oh, excerpt from my book or my article, the same thing. The same thing. So there is no difference. That is also my writing. And whatever you are writing, that is also my writing. So everything is all right. (laughter)"
Hayagrīva,It's all your vibration.,Prabhupāda,Yes. But they should be divided into different names. (laughter) Just like...
Hayagrīva,I have though of doing Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī'sBrahma-saṁhitā.Do you think we could serialize it maybe in three or fourBack to Godheads?Or could we print it ourselves in a little pamphlet? Or which do you think would be better?,Prabhupāda,"No, if you publish inBack to Godhead,then by portion, similarly, three, four pages. That's all, continually, Bhaktisiddhānta's... So when there will be articles sorted, firstGuruMahārāja's, Bhaktisiddhānta's, then mine. Like that. Yes."
Hayagrīva,Yes. Do you think it would be a good...,Prabhupāda,"If you write something, quotation, from Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, that should be first. Just likeguru-paramparā,when we offer our respect, first our own spiritual master, then his spiritual master, then his spiritual master. In this way. But when putting article, that should be the opposite. First Bhaktivinoda, then Bhaktisiddhānta, then my, then my disciples, like that."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:Why don't you write some purports to that?,Prabhupāda,Huh?
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:To Bhaktisiddhānta'sBrahma-saṁhitā.It would be nice if you would write some purports to it.,Prabhupāda,Purports?
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:Yes. Some of us have difficulty understanding BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatī.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. So if I get time... My time is very limited. So even there is difficulty, let them read over and over and again. Then they will understand. Why should we change it? Let it be presented as BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatīhas given, and... Then don't give more than one or two pages at a time. Their brain will be puzzled. (laughter) Yes. WhenGuruMahārājawas speaking, at least my brain was puzzled. (laughter) Even he would speak in Bengali, it was very difficult to understand. He was speaking from a very, very high platform. But I wanted to hear him. That's all. Even I did not understand it. That he appreciated, (laughs) that ""This boy does not go away. He hears."" Actually that was my position. In the beginning I could not understand what he was speaking, but I wanted to hear him. That's all. I was very much anxious to hear him. That he marked. And he was kindly pleased on me, that ""He wants to hear. He does not go away."" That was my policy, that ""let me hear. Even I do not understand, let me hear."" That's all. Yes. Actually I did not understand in the beginning what he was speaking. So Bhaktisiddhānta's writing is not very easy to understand. Yes. But we should try, read and read again, and simply that vibration will help us. That's all. It is transcendental vibration, not that everyone will understand. But if you simply give aural reception to the vibration, that will make him advanced, not exactly that anyone has to understand it. Yes. Just like a man is sleeping and somebody is calling him. In his sleeping condition he does not understand. By calling, calling, calling, he gets up because that vibration is there. Not that in his sleeping condition he is understanding what is this sound is coming. So similarly, we should give reception to the transcendental vibrations made byKṛṣṇaand His bona fide representatives. That will make us awakened. Not that we understand everything."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Prabhupāda, in editing, there are two different policies about using capitals. One is to use as few capitals as possible or to use many capitals, in grammar capitalized, or to use few. So sometimes yourNectar of Devotionhas got very few capitals. WhenBalarāmais referred to as ""he,"" there is no capital. But the other policy is to always put... Kṛṣṇa's Hands, capital H, Kṛṣṇa's Feet, capital F,KṛṣṇaWho, capital W. Which is...",Prabhupāda,"No, no, no. Don't follow that policy. That will not be very... Then..."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:The less capitals, the better?",Prabhupāda,Yes. I think. What do you think?
Hayagrīva,"Well, I think, when referring toKṛṣṇa, we should always have a capital ""H.""",Prabhupāda,"Especially. Yes. Especially forKṛṣṇa, you can."
Hayagrīva,"And if we want to, forRādhā, capital ""S.""",Prabhupāda,ButBalarāmais not different fromKṛṣṇa.
Hayagrīva,"So He is capital ""H."" But then here we go. (laughter)",Prabhupāda,"No, no. You limit to these three. That will do."
Hayagrīva,Limit to those three.,Prabhupāda,OrViṣṇu. Yes.Viṣṇu.
Hayagrīva,"What aboutavatāras,in reference to Christ orBuddha?",Prabhupāda,Buddhais capital used. Jesus Christ is capital used.
Hayagrīva,"No, ""He.""",Prabhupāda,No. That you can use...
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Small.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Then words like Kṛṣṇa's ""pastimes,"" ""entourage,"" His ""will.""",Prabhupāda,"No, small."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Small.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Hayagrīva,"The possessions ofKṛṣṇa, small.",Prabhupāda,Small.
Brahmānanda,Lotus feet?,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Lotus flower?,Prabhupāda,Yes. All small. Simply name. Stick to name.
Hayagrīva,"The pronoun,Kṛṣṇa, ""who."" The pronoun ""who,"" that's not...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. Use small."
Hayagrīva,Thank you. There's so many... That causes a headache for everyone.,Prabhupāda,"No. It is better to make everything sound but slow. We want to create this position ofBack to Godheadas very authorized representation of the science of God. In future people may refer to it, so we should very cautiously and very nicely do it. It is very important thing,Back to Godhead.If our movement is going to be recognized as scientific, God consciousness movement, then thisBack to Godheadwill be referred as authorized scripture. So therefore we have to prepare in such a way, nothing non-conclusive can be introduced in this. That should be our policy. And actually it is the position ofBack to Godhead."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Oh. Well, this is...",Prabhupāda,Glossary?
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:For theĪśopaniṣad.AndHayagrīvaPrabhuthought that there was too much preaching in the definition. Like, say, in the definition ofbhakti,I shouldn't say,""Bhaktiis the highest form ofyoga."" Well, I don't know if... I'm not speaking your words, but to make it, not to preach more, but I thought that was right.",Prabhupāda,Glossary should be short as possible.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Short as possible.,Prabhupāda,Yes. At the same time carrying the meaning.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:The conclusion ofVaiṣṇavaphilosophy. That's the absolute meaning.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. It should not be describing the definition. That is not glossary. Glossary should be explained in gist, but the meaning should be carried."
Hayagrīva,"Well, can we use, for instance, the glossary to yourŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamprinted in India, can we use that as a model for...? Is that...?",Prabhupāda,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?
Hayagrīva,You have a glossary at the end of the first volume. Is that the type of glossary...?,Prabhupāda,"Yes. I have given glossary. You can follow that principle. Yes. And at the end of each book, glossary, index, will carry weight."
Hayagrīva,"Well, that was fairly terse if I remember, though. That was fairly terse. I mean very short, brief. Definitions were very...",Prabhupāda,"One thing may appear to be very simple and to other, terse, but you do your own duty. Another thing: where is theBhagavad-gītāwith my full translation and synonyms? Where is that manuscript?"
Hayagrīva,I have... There are several existing manuscripts. I have... The manuscript I went over is in Columbus.,Prabhupāda,Whole?
Hayagrīva,The total manuscript is there.,Prabhupāda,"So we have to prepare for next publication, revised and enlarged, giving in the same process: original verse, transliteration, synonyms, and translation, and purport."
Pradyumna,"I've already started that, the first chapter.",Prabhupāda,"Our first printing will be this, what is name?Nectar of Devotion.And then, if possible,Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is,revised and enlarged."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Īśopaniṣadis even beforeNectar of Devotion.,Prabhupāda,"Yes.Īśopaniṣad.That is already... And thenBhāgavatam.ThenBhāgavatam.And so farKṛṣṇais concerned,Kṛṣṇawe shall print after thisNectar of Devotionin our press if it is printed. But if I get some money, contribution, from George Harrison, then I may get it printed immediately fromJapan. Yes."
Jayadvaita:,"Jayadvaita:There's another manuscript ofBhagavad-gītāalso in New York, the original.",Prabhupāda,Oh. You have got?
Jayadvaita:,Jayadvaita:Yes. It's in New York except for the first two chapters. Everything else is there.,Prabhupāda,"So first two chapters might be withJanārdana. But you have got the whole thing,Hayagrīva."
Jayadvaita:,"Jayadvaita:Some of it has been edited by Rāyarāma, but you can see around it and go to the original behind it.",Prabhupāda,"So whatever is lacking, you ask me. I will supply you."
Hayagrīva,"I would like to see that in going over mine. I'll have to go over it chapter by chapter. But I will compare the version I have with that version, and... I know the translations themselves, they were somewhat changed inBhagavad-gītāAs It Isas it came out in Macmillan. Did you like those translations?",Prabhupāda,"Whichever is better, you think. That's all. You can follow this Macmillan."
Hayagrīva,That was the second... They're good. I think they're very good.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. You can follow that translation. Simply synonyms he can add, transliterations."
Hayagrīva,And we have all the purports. We can include everything. Nothing will be deleted. Everything will be in there.,Prabhupāda,That's all right.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Prabhupāda, I have a question and it applies only to me, but it's important. A year ago you wrote me in a letter when I was..., said the editing was going slow, to pay more attention to managing the temple. So...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. Managing, you, why don't you make this Giriraja as the temple manager?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:But still... I've already done that. I've made him, but practically I'm still managing anyway. And I madeMurārimanager, but still I'm... I don't spend much time in editing. People are always coming, and I'm running all over the place. I don't edit at all. It makes mesad. I don't...",Prabhupāda,"No, no. They must give relief to you. You can give them instruction, but the actual execution should be done...Pradyumnais there. He can also do. But anyone who is expert in management, he should be... Temple management should not be done directly by you. You can give him policy that ""You do like this."" That's all. Because you have got so many other things to do. Yes. So you create. If there is no expert manager, you create some manager. That is most important thing, to create. To become... (laughs) In our college there was one Mr. Kidd, professor of economics. He was always chastising us. We were student; he was our professor. ""Oh, you cannot have independence. You cannot manage it. You cannot manage. You can work just like ass, but if some asses are given under you, you cannot work."" He was talking like that. ""So don't cry for independence. You are not yet nation."" He was talking like that. So actually his experience was nice, that since the Britishers have gone away, the management of Indian government is not nice. They cannot manage. So he was experienced. He told. I sometimes remember that Professor Kidd told me like that. (laughs) So we have to create nice administrator. That is another function, you see? Every department, we shall create assistant, assistant. So that in case he is ill or he is sick, he cannot work, somebody must work for him."
Brahmānanda,That is how we can expand also.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Some assistant always must be there, training of assistant. So far your editorial is concerned, you can train. NowPuruṣottama, he can also assist you. Similarly, Gaurasundara can assist you."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Jayadvaita is already...,Prabhupāda,"Ah, Jayadvaita. So in this way you should create assistant editors also."
Hayagrīva,Thus far Satsvarūpa...,Prabhupāda,That dictaphone can be done in Detroit. That boyBhagavāndāsais here. He has offered service.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:There's one thing... It seems to be easy, but it's very difficult to hear your voice.",Prabhupāda,"That will require practice. He may commit some mistake in the beginning, but when he is practiced, he will do the right thing. So that you cannot avoid. You cannot change my voice."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:So just now you've sent aKṛṣṇatape. Should I, rather than do that, give it toBhagavān?",Prabhupāda,"No. First of all test him, who will do that. Test him here, whether he can understand. (break?)"
Brahmānanda,"I also have a dictaphone in New York, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,That is mine.
Brahmānanda,No. I have another one also. I also can have tapes typed.,Prabhupāda,"So that can be distributed, tapes. Yes. In different centers they will have dictaphone and they'll do it."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:And then send me the copy to edit.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes.
Hayagrīva,"But before you send them, make a tape, make a recording of them so you can check them over if you want to check them over. 'Cause I don't have time to do that.",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So taping, recording, that does not take much time."
Hayagrīva,No. Somebody can do that for you.,Prabhupāda,You can keep it and record. Yes. So manage in that way. We have to train so many things. So tactfully you have to do that.
Hayagrīva,"Then he does the first editing. After it's typed up off the dictaphone, Satsvarūpa does the first editing. Then I go over what he has gone over and check the manuscript...",Prabhupāda,"Yes. What you do, he goes. And what he does, you go. Then final. In this way. But the last editing should be checked twice. The dictaphone, then checked by him and then by you. Or checked by you and then by him. That's all."
Hayagrīva,Yes. AndPradyumnadoes the Sanskrit after.,Prabhupāda,Yes. That's all. That is printing department.
Hayagrīva,And then Jayadvaita does the composing.,Prabhupāda,Jayadvaita and others.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:PālikāandArundhati.,Prabhupāda,"Now, I heard that you are composing fifty pages daily, altogether?"
Jayadvaita:,"Jayadvaita:No, not fifty pages. The manuscript pages, yesterday we composed about forty manuscript pages.",Prabhupāda,"Correct, all? Complete?"
Jayadvaita:,"Jayadvaita:Yes. The original... It's done twice. So those first pages, the first time, they'd already been done.",Prabhupāda,"No, no. These forty pages, they are complete?"
Jayadvaita:,Jayadvaita:Yes. They are complete.,Prabhupāda,"That's nice. That is encouraging. So even if you complete thirty pages daily, that will be very nice."
Pradyumna,"They'll get faster because ŚyāmadāsīandArundhatiwere just typing fourteen hours a day in Columbus and they were getting at least twenty manuscript pages done, and now it's...",Prabhupāda,"Anyway, you are the in-charge of this composition. You orJaya-govinda? Who is in charge of the composition?"
Jayadvaita:,Jayadvaita:Mostly I am doing it.,Prabhupāda,"Accha.Then you get easily not less than thirty pages daily, complete. That will satisfy. Is that all right?"
Jayadvaita:,Jayadvaita:That's all right.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. Then our books are, biggest book, four hundred pages. So thirty pages daily means, what is that? Within fifteen days you can complete."
Jayadvaita:,"Jayadvaita:Thirty manuscript pages, thirty book pages?",Prabhupāda,Thirty book pages. No. Or what is the manuscript pages? I do not understand.
Jayadvaita:,"Jayadvaita:When it's typed out, we've been doing about...",Prabhupāda,I want complete for being photographed.
Pradyumna,Forty of these.,Prabhupāda,"Oh. All right. These are forty pages. Such, say, in fifteen days how many pages?"
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:450.,Prabhupāda,"So you take up twenty days, one month for one book?"
Hayagrīva,I cannot edit much faster than forty pages a day.,Prabhupāda,"No, no. Don't do it, I mean to say, so hastily. But do it slowly and surely. That will be nice. Yes."
Brahmānanda,"One book, one month.",Prabhupāda,"No, that you are printing, that ""one book, one month"" for the last six months. (laughs) That is in theory only. Actually it has not happened. Now do everything solidly so that at least in two months we finish one book. That's all. Is that all right?"
Jayadvaita:,Jayadvaita:Yes.,Prabhupāda,You say everything all right. (laughter) Anyway...
Pradyumna,I didn't edit so many today. I edited fifty yesterday.,Prabhupāda,So I think I want... I shall be very glad to see theNectar of Devotionis finished before I leave this place and you begin some other book.
Jayadvaita:,Jayadvaita:The second part... We've finished the first part. We're now into the second part.,Prabhupāda,"Second part, which second part?"
Hayagrīva,"You want me to doNectar of Devotionand thenKṛṣṇaand thenBhagavad-gītā,in that order?",Prabhupāda,"Yes. So everything is all right,bṛhat-mṛdaṅgadepartment? Majorsaṅkīrtanaparty. They are going,saṅkīrtanaparties in different cities. That is junior. But your, this party, it is senior. You are sitting one place; you have to work thousand times more than them. Yes. You have to edit in such a way. Where is that water?"
Brahmānanda,"It's being offered, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,"All right, all right. That's all..."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:I have a question from the art department.,Prabhupāda,"Art, yes."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Jadurānī asks are they going too slow? She wants to know are they going too slow. They have thirty pictures ready.,Prabhupāda,"One thing, that Jadurānī should have some assistants. She alone cannot do that."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:Well, Prabhupāda, you used that word once before, assistant. So then when Jāhnavā saw that letter she said, ""That means I should paint."" So all that assistant meant was that they all painted. And Śāradīyā began to paint. I don't know what you mean by assistant.",Prabhupāda,Assistant means that they should work under her direction. That is assistant.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:And produce pictures side by side with her.,Prabhupāda,"Yes. I give some idea, sketch, and then under that sketch, instruction of Jadurānī, and..."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:So according to Jadurānī, only she, Muralīdhara,Devahūti, and Baradraj were good enough, that the other weren't good painters, Jāhnavā and Śāradīyā. But I don't know that.",Prabhupāda,"Then they may practice. They may be given to practice, not the actual work. So... But they are scattered in different places."
Brahmānanda,Baradraj is coming to Boston.,Prabhupāda,"Baradraj is good. Yes. He can... If he likes, he can do much work."
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:And Muralīdhara is good and also produces.Devahūtiis good, but doesn't produce.",Prabhupāda,SoDevahūtihas gone. I would have talked with her.
Brahmānanda,Yes. I don't have her address.,Prabhupāda,"Oh, she does not live in the temple."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:What aboutMādhava-lati?,Prabhupāda,Yes. She is good painter.
Kīrtanānanda:,"Kīrtanānanda:She's exhibiting a much niceratti... She had asarion today, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda,Huh?
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:She had asarion today.,Prabhupāda,Sari?
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:Yes. She was wearing asariat the temple. She looks very nice.,Prabhupāda,"No, she is nice. She is talented."
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:She could be an assistant painter.,Prabhupāda,"And why not somebody marry her? If somebody want to marry, then she will be all right."
Brahmānanda,Nayanābhirāma wanted to marry her.,Prabhupāda,Then why not ask and get her married? Yes. Then she will be fixed up. I think she requires to be married. Then she will be satisfied.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:One more question from art was...,Prabhupāda,"She is here. I recommend that just ask her to get married. If she agrees, that, what is that boy?"
Brahmānanda,Nayanābhirāma.,Prabhupāda,Let them marry and live here.
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:The other question was, is the subject matter, as they're being done, is there any criticism or should it be changed? The paintings that have been finished thus far, should they be changed in some way?",Prabhupāda,"Then... These paintings are first-class, these paintings."
Brahmānanda,"Is that one first-class there, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,No.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:What's the trouble?,Prabhupāda,"The trouble is that Kṛṣṇa's body is... Why it is made so big? Why the others, inhabitants ofVṛndāvana, smaller?"
Satsvarūpa:,"Satsvarūpa:He's supposed to be up in the front. He's supposed to be in the front, and they're all behind Him. But it mustn't be done well enough.",Prabhupāda,"Well, that is... Do you think that is represented?Kṛṣṇadid not show His gigantic body. As He was, He lifted. Yes."
Hayagrīva,He seems gigantic.,Prabhupāda,Kṛṣṇacould show His gigantic. Actually He expanded His gigantic body. Otherwise how He could lift?
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:These are very nice.,Prabhupāda,These things are... Yes.
Brahmānanda,"Do you like this one, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda,"This is also not bad, but..."
Kīrtanānanda:,Kīrtanānanda:The calf looks like a dog.,Prabhupāda,Huh? Yes.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:So they should be done over.,Prabhupāda,Yes. Yes. This is all right. You see? So you can take some photograph like this picture. This is also...Kṛṣṇais patting a cow.
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:That's a good one.,Prabhupāda,Yes.
Brahmānanda,We should just reproduce that as it is?,Prabhupāda,"Yes, why not?"
Hayagrīva,"Gurudāsa has some very excellent pictures from the archives taken from books that were printed several hundreds of years ago,Bhagavad-gītāand some woodcuts ofNṛsiṁha, which would be considered quite artistic, but maybe we can send them to you to see if they meet your approval and maybe reproduce them.",Prabhupāda,"No, whatever card, form, we get, unless we have got arrangement for worship... Of course, we can keep, but our, any form, wooden or stone, that should be worshiped."
Hayagrīva,"These are photographs, these are pictures.",Prabhupāda,"Oh, pictures. Then it is all right. All right. It is all right?"
Satsvarūpa:,Satsvarūpa:Yes. That's all.,Prabhupāda,"That's all. So now distributeprasādam.First of all, chant once moreHareKṛṣṇa. (end)"
